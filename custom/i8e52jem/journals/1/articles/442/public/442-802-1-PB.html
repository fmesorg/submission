			<h3>MBBS doctors working as quacks: private practice by interns in Kerala
			medical colleges</h3>
			<h4 class="author">E M Sreejit</h4>
			<hr>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					The idea of calling MBBS doctors "quacks" may seem strange
					to many, especially to those who are used to hearing about
					unqualified people practising medicine. For many in the
					medical fraternity, the practices described here may not be
					viewed with disapproval. So what exactly is this practice and
					what are its ramifications? Before I get into the details, it will
					be worth taking a look into the life of an intern in a medical
					college hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the early 1990s I was working in a medical college hospital
					in Kerala as an intern or house surgeon. The house surgeon's
					post, or internship, was a year-long, compulsory programme
					for all medical students after passing the gruelling MBBS
					degree course. It was a time in the professional life of a
					young trainee doctor where s/he would be directly involved
					in the care of patients with a degree of autonomy in clinical
					decision making. A prototypal internship programme saw an
					intern spending three months each in the core departments
					of medicine, surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology and in
					allied specialties such as paediatrics, ophthalmology and ear,
					nose and throat. Another important spell in the internship
					programme took these trainee doctors to a primary health
					centre for three months for a posting in "social and preventive
					medicine" or "SPM".
				</p>
				<p>
					Young doctors considered the internship physically taxing but
					immensely satisfying. Internship in Kerala (I imagine this is true
					in other states as well) was a training ground for more than one
					reason. Interns were taken under the wings of senior doctors
					who supervised them and also imparted clinical skills. Interns
					sometimes saw the senior doctors as mentors and the choice of
					speciality for their postgraduate degree or diploma was often
					affected by the charisma and influence of these senior doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interns performed many clinical procedures independently,
					ranging from simple ones like urinary catheterisation and
					cannula insertion to more complicated ones like conducting
					deliveries and performing minor surgeries. Some young
					doctors saw internship as an opportunity to put into practice
					what they had learnt as undergraduate students. For many,
					especially those who stopped their academic pursuits at
					the MBBS stage without aspiring to become postgraduate
					specialists, internship was a natural step towards building
					successful careers as practising clinicians. Although supervised
					by seniors most of the time, there were occasions when interns
					found themselves forced to take decisions on their own, which
					was nerve racking to say the least. But independent decision-making was mostly reserved for simple and uncomplicated
					clinical situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a significant number of these interns (incidentally, almost
					all of them men), internship was also memorable for "quack"
					practice. It was jokingly referred to as "quack practice" in the
					local parlance because interns did not have the legal sanction
					to practise without supervision and work in private hospitals,
					clinics and nursing homes. It is not difficult to understand why:
					Interns were half-baked physicians who could, potentially,
					jeopardise the health of patients if left to treat them without
					supervision. But these arguments did not deter interns.
				</p>
				<p>
					This form of clinical practice thrived for many reasons. Foremost
					among them was the monetary gain it offered. There was also
					the belief that it would prepare interns well for when they
					went out to work in the private sector. Interns saw this practice
					as some kind of programme for mental toughening which
					would keep them in good stead for the rough times ahead.
					Peer pressure and a sense of accomplishment were two other
					reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					What did this quack practice entail? And how did the system
					work?</p>
				<p>
					During my days in Kerala, interns stayed in quarters centrally
					located in the hospital. The quarters were, in some ways, a hub
					where young doctors with impressionable minds got some of
					the most important lessons of their career. This tutoring had a
					non-classroom, rugged, macho feel to it.</p>
				<p>
					People learned their lessons the hard way, they would say. The
					quarters had a reception room located in such a way that the
					interns had to go past it to enter or leave the building. The
					reception room also housed the housekeeper's workstation
					and the housekeeper knew every intern in the quarters. It was
					in this room that the deals were struck. The reception boy and
					the housekeeper brokered these deals. It was common for
					messengers of private nursing homes or hospitals to bring
					offers to the receptionist who would in turn pass it on to the
					intern-who was only too willing to make some extra money.
					Another way was through word-of-mouth publicity about the
					hospitals.</p>
				<p>
					A majority of these offers involved up to two to three days of
					work. These opportunities arose because doctors (often doctors
					who were single owners of private clinics) needed someone to
					run their clinics while they went out of town for a few days. The presence of an intern ensured that there was no break in the
					regular routine of the clinic resulting from the owner's absence.
					This was done with an eye to maintaining the goodwill of
					people in the community. It was also considered "safe and
					judicious" to seek help from interns because the money they
					needed to pay interns was far less than the revenue they
					generated for the clinic or hospital-not to forget the other
					non-monetary gains involved in maintaining the continuity.
					Some other advantages of hiring interns included their easy
					availability, the ease of "handling" them, and the fact that they
					were not perceived as a threat to the doctors' own practice.</p>
				<p>
					There were unwritten rules of such practice, all meant to avoid
					mishaps that could destroy the reputation of the clinic and of
					the regular in-house doctors. These privately-owned clinics had
					one clear brief for interns: to manage patients in a manner that
					maintained continuity and ensured that the reputation of the
					clinic was not tarnished by negligence or misconduct. For an
					intern keen to make some money on the side, this was not a
					tough proposition to follow.</p>
				<p>
					What was considered "safe practice"? Examples include
					clinically managing a young patient with typical symptoms of
					acid peptic disease. Examples of unsafe practice could be an
					obstetric case that required the conduct of delivery, or an old
					patient with a history of heart disease. Interns were advised
					to refer "unsafe cases" to a medical college instead of a nearby
					private practitioner capable of managing them. This was to
					avoid loss of goodwill and also to safeguard the business
					interests of the clinic which feared losing its clientele.</p>
				<p>
					This form of "quack" practice was considered a win-win
					situation by the interns: the money they earned was a fortune
					considering what they received as stipends, there were no legal
					obligations to the clinic they served, and the job was perceived
					to be safe. Many interns who accepted such offers did not
					feel that they were doing something wrong. After all, "quack
					practice" was a long and deeply entrenched tradition and had
					the tacit approval of the postgraduate resident doctors and
					the teaching staff in medical college hospitals. Those with
					ethical misgivings stifled them with the argument that interns
					would never do anything "stupid" during "quack" practice
					that would cause harm to or jeopardise the life of the patient.
					This was because there was nothing to gain, monetarily or
					otherwise, from indulging in daredevilry. Second, interns would
					mostly ensure that these offers did not clash with their official
					responsibilities as interns. They would accept these offers only
					on the weekends when they did not have weekend on-call
					commitments-or when they had an SPM posting at a primary
					health centre, which they viewed as not so important for their
					careers. They would rarely trade their clinical postings for these
					offers because they valued the skills acquired during internship
					more.</p>
				<p>
					But the biggest push factor in favour of "quack practice" was
					that this form of practice served as a springboard for interns in
					their future careers. Interns also sought refuge in the "baptism
					by fire" argument: people who did not experience quack
					practice would be inept in handling the more difficult real-life
					situations in their private clinical practice. This confidencebuilding
					argument gained a lot of credibility and was often
					used by interns to assuage their guilt about having done
					something wrong.</p>
				<p>
					Quack practice was also viewed as an achievement and an
					indication of the market value of interns. They would brag
					about the number of such offers they received. Some earned
					enough money to buy a motorcycle, or to splurge on expensive
					clothes. Others were more judicious and spent the money on
					books for postgraduate exam coaching classes. A select few
					were known to be hard bargainers and would manage to
					negotiate for higher payments when the nursing home owner
					was desperate for their services.</p>
				<p>
					It was a simple business. The reception boy would get his
					kickbacks from the intern. If the kickbacks were good he would
					ensure that the same person got the opportunity again. Of
					course, feedback from nursing home owners also mattered
					when re-employing the same intern.</p>
				<p>
					Incidentally, it was almost unheard of for women interns to indulge in this form of practice.</p>
