				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The European Commission has proposed a new regulation to  														replace the current clinical trials directive. The proposed regulation  														aims at accelerating the application procedure and simplifying  														and harmonising the administrative requirements for multi-centre  														trials across the European Union.
				</p>
				<p>
					One striking feature of the proposed regulation is a two-tiered  														assessment, one at the central level, to be carried out by a  														reference member state, binding on all concerned member states;  														and one at the national level, where the ethics aspects will be  														assessed. Second, the proposal no longer requires the approval  														of the clinical trial application by a separate ethics committee.  														Third, it introduces the concept of "low intervention" trials that will  														undergo a "light" approval procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposed regulation may stimulate clinical trials that yield  														substantial public health benefits. However, it is a step back in  														terms of protection of the rights and safety of trial participants. It  														undermines current frameworks for ethical review by not requiring  														the involvement of an ethics committee, and by insufficiently  														integrating the Declaration of Helsinki into assessment procedures  														at the national and European levels. The introduction of the riskbased  														approach needs more preparation as there is no consensus  														yet on key issues, such as how to define risk, and who is going to  														define it.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<h5>Background of the new regulation</h5>
				<p>
					On July 17, 2012, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1)</a> on clinical trials repealing the  														existing directive on clinical trials 2001/20/EC   (hereafter referred to as the directive). This directive has been   severely 								criticised for contributing to a significant drop in the number of clinical trials conducted in Europe due to the administrative burden and corresponding delays and costs. The proposed regulation aims at accelerating the application procedure and simplifying and harmonising administrative requirements,  														especially for multi-centre trials across the European   Union  														(EU).
				</p>
				<h5>The proposed regulation explained in short</h5>
				<p>
					The current directive requires the submission of separate application dossiers for each of the countries involved in a multicentre trial. The Commission now proposes the submission of one harmonised application dossier to a single portal managed by the European Commission. The assessment of the application will be split into two parts while making  "a clear distinction between aspects where member states  cooperate in the assessment and aspects of an intrinsic ethical  or national/local nature where the assessment is made by each  member state individually" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:4)</a>. One reporting member state,selected by the sponsor, will lead the central assessment (part  I) and each involved member state will assess the national/ ethical aspects individually (part II). For both parts, very short timelines have been set. The assessment by the reporting member state will be binding on all concerned member states, and only in certain pre-defined cases has a state the right to "opt out" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:33)</a>, and not allow the trial in its country. No option has been created for the concerned member states to influence the decision of the central assessment. Failure to meet the deadlines will be understood as tacit approval.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposed regulation chooses "not to interfere" with the  														member state's internal organization of the bodies involved in the national/ethical authorisation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet].

It also introduces a  														new subcategory of clinical trials, 'low intervention trials' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet].

Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:26)</a> which are considered to have a lower risk profile and for which  									        certain obligations are reduced.

				<h4>Proposed changes</h4>
				<ol>
					<h5>
					<li>
						Major changes in ethical review
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						The first change related to ethical review is that the proposed  														regulation no longer requires the approval of the clinical trial  														application by an ethics committee. This is a major shift from  														the current directive which requires the establishment of ethics  														committees in all member states in order to ensure protection  														of trial subjects. The proposed regulation explicitly states that:  														"it does not regulate or harmonize the precise functioning of  														Ethics Committees, nor impose a systematic cooperation at  														an operational level between ethics committees in the EU  														[...]. Rather the proposed Regulation leaves it up to member  														states to organize, internally, the attribution of tasks to different  														bodies" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:5)</a>. The only requirement is that the application must  														be assessed by a "reasonable number of persons who are  														independent, who have collectively the necessary qualifications  														and experience in all relevant fields, including the view of lay  											    persons" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:5)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Second, the proposed regulation explicitly states that ethical  														issues should be assessed only at the national level and not  														during the centralised assessment <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:17)</a>. However, aspects  														which are covered in the central assessment include the  														anticipated therapeutic and public health benefits and the risks  														and inconveniences for the subject. These are of an intrinsically  														ethical nature and hence require an integrated <em>ethical</em>, medical  														and scientific assessment. If this is not done, subjects run the  														risk of participating in potentially harmful or unnecessary trials.  														One could contend that there are sufficient opportunities to  														safeguard the rights of trial subjects as the protocol will be  														checked for ethical aspects at the national level. However the  														proposed regulation seriously undermines this safeguard  														on three counts. First, it does not require ethics committees  														to carry out the ethics assessment, as was already explained  														above. Second, even though it says ethics should be dealt with  														at the national level, the proposed regulation severely limits  														the ethical criteria upon which the ethical assessment should  														be done <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:32)</a>. Important ethical issues such as the acceptance  														of placebo-controlled trials and post-trial treatment access, for  														example, are not mentioned. Third, the timeline allotted for the  														assessment to take place has been shortened from 60 days in  											    the current directive, to 10 days in the proposed regulation.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the proposed regulation, the European Commission offers  														no justification of why ethical review should be left completely  														to the national level. It seems to contradict point 66 of the  														Introduction which says: "Since the objective of this Regulation,  														namely to ensure that, throughout the Union, clinical trial data  														are reliable and robust while <em>ensuring the safety and rights of  														subjects</em>, cannot sufficiently be achieved by Member   States and  														can by reason of the scale of the measure be better   achieved  														at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in   accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which determines when the  														EU is competent to legislate, as set out in Article 5 of   the Treaty  														of the European Union." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:25)</a> Furthermore, the 'Charter of  														Fundamental Rights for the European Union' (binding law for  														most Member State s) includes a high level of human health  														protection in all its policies <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Union. Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union [Internet]. Official Journal of the European Communities, 2000 Dec18 [cited 2013 Mar 12];22p..Available from: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ charter/pdf/text_en.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. In our opinion, the protection of  														trial subjects against unethical clinical trials is covered by this  														Charter and therefore provides the legal basis to also assess  														ethical aspects at the central level.
					</p>
					<p>
						By including international ethical standards in the central  														assessment, protection of trial participants will be harmonised  														and better safeguarded in each country. For example, it often  														happens that a sponsor declares that the regulator demanded  														a placebo-controlled trial for scientific reasons. While western  														European ethics committees may reject it on ethical grounds,  														eastern European committees may accept it, subjecting  														eastern European participants to unethical clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Schipper I, Weyzig F. Ethics for drug testing in low and middle income countries[Internet]. Amsterdam: SOMO;2008 Feb [cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from: http://somo.nl/publications-en/Publication_2472" id="3">(3)</a>.  														If compliance with international ethical guidelines were to  														be assessed at the central level, such a double standard for  														western and eastern European participants would be avoided.  														This does not negate the right that member states have to  														assess the trial for compliance with national ethical guidelines  														and laws.
					</p>
					<h5>
					<li>
						Effects on trial participants
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						The proposed regulation seriously undermines the ethical  														framework which the current directive had started to build.  														Currently the procedures, composition and quality of ethics  														committees across the EU vary greatly <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kenter MJ, Cohen, AF. Re-engineering the European Union Clinical Trials Directive. Lancet. 2012 May 12;379(9828):1765-7. doi: 10.1016/S0140- 6736(12)60430-9." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Veerus P, Lexchin J, Hemminki E: Legislative regulation and ethical governance of medical research in different European Union countries. Submitted paper (2013)" id="5">5)</a> and, as a result,  														clinical trial participants across Europe do not have the same  														levels of protection. The proposed regulation does not set out  														to harmonise the quality of European ethics committees to a  														high common standard, either by demanding clearly defined  														standards for individual ethics committees, or by demanding  														collaboration among ethics committees at the EU level. As a  														result, the quality of ethics committees across Europe runs the  														risk of becoming diluted in time. This lack of emphasis on ethics  														is in stark contrast to the emphasis the Commission has given  														to speeding up the approval process.
					</p>
					<p>
						The proposed regulation introduces the subcategory of socalled 'low-intervention trials' which are considered to have a  														lower risk profile. This measure seems to correspond especially  														with the need for less red tape for non-commercial sponsors,  														academicians, or groups like cancer research associations  														testing different treatments. Many of these trials are driven by  														pressing public health needs <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Global Science Forum. Facilitating International Cooperation in Non- Commercial Clinical Trials[Internet]. Paris: OECD Global Science Forum; 2011 Oct [cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from: http://www.oecd.org/sti/s cienceandtechnologypolicy/49344626.pdf" id="6">(6)</a> and the introduction of this  														subcategory would allow them to start faster and operate  														with less regulation. Such trials are considered less risky by the  														Commission than commercial trials because they experiment  														with drugs already on the market <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">(7)</a>, for which reason the  														proposed regulation allows for less stringent rules <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:17)</a> and  											    shorter timelines for authorisation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet].

					</p>
					<p>
						However, the fact that a drug is already on the market   does  														not necessarily lower the risk for patients. Examples of   studies  														that would have fallen into the category of low   intervention trials are the REGULATE study with benfluorex (Mediator)   and  														the VIGOR study with rofecoxib (Vioxx) <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="AIM, ISDB, Medicines in Europe Forum, WEMOS Foundation.

Available from: www.isdbweb.org/publications/ download/174" id="8">(8)</a> which resulted in  														countless deaths.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to the proposed regulation, low-intervention trials  														need not provide for damage compensation (be it insurance  														or indemnification) for the trial <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:9)</a>, <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission.

It is irresponsible to  														not demand insurance for trials aiming to improve treatments,  														or comparing drugs on the market. Nor is it responsible  														to introduce a risk-based approach without a consensus  														agreement on how to define the risk and without developing  												  tools and guidelines on risk assessment.
					</p>
					<p>
						The proposed regulation states that modifications only need to  														be subject to an authorisation procedure similar to the initial  														assessment "when those modifications have substantial impact  														on the safety or rights of the subjects" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:18)</a>. However, there is  														no definition of what is "substantial", and the procedures are  														unclear (for example it is unclear who decides it is substantial)  														which also leads to a negative impact on the safeguards.
					</p>
					<p>
						The official acceptance of co-sponsorship in the proposed  														regulation acknowledges the fact that "clinical trials are  														increasingly initiated by loose networks of scientists and  														scientific institutions with one Member State or across several  														Member States" and that these networks have "legal difficulties  														in forming, jointly, one legal entity to act as a 'single sponsor'" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:9)</a> which is currently required by the directive. Although the  														proposed regulation does specify the sponsor's responsibilities  														within co-sponsorships <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:59)</a>, it categorically rejects the need  														for the sponsor to cover "liability for harm of a patient"; the  														rules on "liability depend on the applicable national liability  														laws and are independent from the responsibility of a sponsor".  														Covering of liability therefore falls outside the scope of this  														regulation. However, when participants experience damage  														in a multicentre trial which includes third countries, how will  														they solve the question of liability when the legal entity is  														not identified? The obstacles for victims to start litigation are  														already insurmountable <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Schipper I. Clinical trials in developing countries: how to protect people against unethical practices [Internet]. Brussels: European Parliament' 2009 Mar [cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from: http://somo. nl/publications-en/Publication_3035" id="9">(9)</a>. The regulation only worsens the  														situation and leads to even fewer victims having access to  														compensation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The proposed Regulation places the obligation on member  														states to set up a national indemnification mechanism which  														shall be free of charge for trials not intended for marketing  														authorisations, and subject to fee for all other trials. This will  														help, in particular, non-commercial sponsors who face high  														costs and great difficulty obtaining coverage <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission. Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC [Internet]. Brussels:EC;2012 Jul 17[cited 2013 Mar 12]. Available from:http:// ec.europa.eu/health/files/clinicaltrials/2012_07/proposal/2012_07_ proposal_en.pdf" id="1">(1:60)</a>. But it  														will also apply to commercial sponsors for whom it can be  														extremely beneficial (as they will profit from public money).  														Further, it is doubtful if all member states can afford and  														maintain such a scheme, and this can lead to double standards  												  in compensating damage.
					</p>
					<p>
						The last issue that potentially affects clinical trial safeguards  														concerns safety reporting. The proposed regulation  														requires only the reporting of unexpected adverse events  														that affect the benefit-risk balance through the EU portal.  														Some argue that all serious events should be reported as  														all of them could affect the benefit-risk balance <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gotzsche PC. Deficiencies in proposed new EU regulation of clinical trials. BMJ. 2012 Dec 20;345:e8522. doi:10.1136/bmj.e8522." id="10">(10)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several of the changes mentioned above, such as the  														introduction of low intervention trials, the introduction of  														the principle of co-sponsorship and the less stringent rules  														on safety reporting are welcomed by non-commercial  														sponsors and seem to be designed to respond to their  														needs. However, the proposed regulation, as it is now,  														may undermine some existing safeguards for participants.  														The proposed regulation covers all clinical trials, of which  														the majority is commercially sponsored. It does not take  														sufficient account of the effect on commercially sponsored  														trials.
					</p>
					<h5>
					<li>
						Effects on third countries
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						Although the proposed regulation is intended to govern  														clinical trials on European soil, it does include references to  														clinical trials in third countries with the aim of building in  														better safeguards.
					</p>
					<p>
						First of all, it refers to clinical trials in third countries that have  														already been finalised and that are part of the application  														dossier. It states that they should be carried out according  														to principles equivalent to those set out in the regulation.  														However, it seems unlikely that compliance with ethical  														principles will be considered a priority by those bodies in  														Europe which will assess the application dossier.
					</p>
					<p>
						Second, the proposed regulation gives the European  														Commission an opportunity to carry out inspections in third  														countries to establish whether the regulatory system in third  														countries is compliant with Good Clinical Practice and ethical  														standards(1:61). However, this measure will most likely not be  														taken seriously if the EU places so little emphasis on ethics in  														its own territory. Our main concern is that lowering of ethical  														requirements in Europe will ultimately have a negative spin-off  														on the protection of clinical trial participants outside Europe.  														The proposed regulation will most likely have a negative  														impact on ethics assessment during the market authorisation  														procedure for pharmaceuticals entering the EU market.  														Currently, the marketing authorisation in the EU requires  														ethics committee approval for clinical trials carried out in third  														countries. How can the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  														maintain this requirement, if the EU does not maintain it for  														its own territory? Will the EMA drop the requirement once the  														regulation is implemented? This would be another setback for  														the protection of trial participants; as it was when the US Food  														and Drugs Administration (FDA) decided that compliance with  														the Declaration of Helsinki (DOH) was no longer needed for  												  trials carried out outside the US.
					</p>

					<h5>
					<li>
						What should be done?
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						The regulation needs to be modified. In order to protect the  														rights and safety of clinical trial subjects it is necessary to  														assess ethical aspects of a clinical trial application not only  														at the<em> national </em>level but also at the<em> central level</em>.   The aspects  														covered at the centralised level, part 1, assessment, are   already  														of an intrinsically ethical nature; hence the proposed   regulation  														should insist on the involvement of experts in medical   ethics at  														this level. Although the proposed regulation refers to the   DOH,it does not firmly integrate crucial elements of the DOH in the  														assessment procedure. Essential requirements to protect   the  														rights of trial participants such as post trial treatment   access  														and justification of the use of a placebo should be   mentioned  														in the proposed regulation. Assessment of compliance with  														international ethical guidelines at the central level will   avoid  														double standards for participants in different countries.
					</p>
					<p>
						As mentioned above, the diversity in the functioning of ethics  														committees leads to diverging levels of protection of citizens  														across Europe. Therefore the standards of ethics committees  														should be harmonised through clear requirements regarding  														composition and procedures. The development of a European  														body monitoring the quality of ethics committees across  														Europe could heighten the overall standard.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, the introduction of the binding single decision by only  														one reference state should be removed, the short timelines  														should be modified, and the 'tacit' authorisation removed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The introduction of certain measures, such as the risk-based  														approach, co-sponsorship and the national indemnification  														mechanism, might have a negative impact on the rights and  														safety of the trial participants and definitely need more work  														in order to provide the maximum protection for trial subjects.  														Although there seems to be a broad consensus on adopting  														a risk-based approach to clinical trial regulation, there is no  														consensus on key issues, such as how to define the risk, and  														who is to define it. Tools and guidelines on risk assessment  														need to be developed.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The proposed regulation is very emphatic in terms of  														harmonisation and acceleration of the authorisation   procedure.  														As such, the regulation could prove a stimulus to clinical   trials  														that might yield substantial public health benefits.   However,  														it is a step back in terms of protection of the rights and   safety  														of trial participants. The proposed regulation undermines  														the current frameworks for ethical review by not requiring  														the involvement of an ethics committee, and by   insufficiently  														integrating the Declaration of Helsinki into the   assessment  														procedures at the national and the European level.   Furthermore,  														the proposed regulation introduces concepts such as low   risk  														trials and co-sponsorship which in the current formulation  														could jeopardise the position of clinical trial   participants. This proposed regulation clearly gives more importance to   the promotion of science and future public health benefits   than to the rights and safety of the individual clinical trial   participant. As such, the regulation contradicts the fundamental   principle   of medical research involving human beings as set out in   the  														Declaration of Helsinki, in the Nuremberg Code, and in the  														guidelines of the International Conference on   Harmonisation  														of Technical Requirements for Registration of   Pharmaceuticals  														for Human Use, namely that the well-being of the   individual  														research subject must take precedence over all other   interests.
