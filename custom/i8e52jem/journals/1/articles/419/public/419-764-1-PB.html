				<h4>Cronin A J. The Citadel UK: Gollancz; 1937. 446 pages.
				ISBN: 0-450-01041-4</h4>
				<p>
					Set in Great Britain in the inter-war years, A J Cronin's The Citadel
					is often credited with sparking off the movement that led to the
					establishment of the National Health Service. The novel begins
					in 1921 with the arrival of a young doctor, Andrew Manson, to
					Drineffy, a Welsh mining town. It tells the story of his rise from a
					young physician's assistant to a successful consultant in London.
					It is an interesting and enlightening document of the medical
					system existing at that time. At the same time, it is a romance,
					beginning with his falling in love with Christine, a primary school
					teacher, and moving on to their marriage and, then, as he moves
					up the social ladder, his liaison with Frances, a married woman,
					who teaches him how to be successful. The novel ends with an
					idealistic coming together of Andrew, his surgeon friend Denny,
					and a maverick pharmacist, Hope. The three decide to set up a
					type of polyclinic in a moffusil town, moving out of avaricious
					and overcrowded London to deliver medical care where it is
					most needed and on sound scientific principles.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Citadel</em> is strangely familiar; the picture of poverty in
					the mining town could well be set in Dhanbad or Bokaro in
					our present times, where a young doctor struggles against
					malnutrition and illness caused by hunger, want and bad
					working conditions. Much like our own fresh medical graduates,
					when thrust into rural practice without the backup of a team,
					Andrew realises how little of medicine he actually knows. He
					is forced, as many of us are, to substitute good public health
					practice with ineffectual personal hygiene measures because
					the system cannot be made to do its job. However, Andrew and
					his friend do succeed in obtaining a new drainage system-by
					exploding dynamite in the sewage lines and surrounding the
					councilor's bungalow with filth.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet, as Andrew moves ahead in life, his zeal for practising
					good medicine is diminished by the compulsions of success.
					His research on lung disease in anthracite mine workers
					yields him an MD but also takes him away from the mining
					communities that nurtured his work. He becomes a bureaucrat,
					tangled up in mindless paperwork. His original research is used
					by politicians to further their own careers while he is left with
					only the consolation of knowing that his work will help miners
					file claims for compensation. He achieves personal success as a
					clinician, setting up first as a general practitioner and then as
					a private consultant, his idealism and vision getting lost along
					the way. His personal life parallels his professional growth, as
					he drifts away from Christine, his conscience keeper, and gets
					attracted to Frances, a suave upper class woman who is more
					enthusiastic about his pursuit of wealth and fame.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Citadel</em> chronicles almost all the problems with our own
					medical system-cronyism, red-tapism, kickbacks, negligence,
					and corruption bred by the unhealthy overcrowding of doctors
					in big cities, even while the rural areas have no doctors to
					serve their needs. The book ends with a climactic speech in
					his own defense by Andrew at a hearing before the medical
					council, where he has been charged with collaborating with an
					American TB expert, who is not a qualified doctor, in conducting
					surgery on a friend's daughter.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Citadel</em> does not rank as an artistic masterpiece. Its message
					is delivered without much subtlety, but nonetheless with a
					great deal of passion and conviction. Andrew is a loveable
					character, human in his frailties, his quick temper and petty
					jealousy and yet noble in his capacity to do his duty as a
					doctor. Andrew is a middle class hero with no family support
					or privilege, struggling against peers who have the medical
					profession in their grip due to their social standing and
					wealth. His struggle is that of establishing a fairer and more
					just, though not revolutionary, order where he can practise as
					a good professional. He flirts briefly with life as a high society
					consultant but returns eventually to the joys of family life and
					friendship. His vision of healthcare is typically individual, with
					the enlightened doctor at its centre. Although the book offers
					detailed insight and description of the poverty both in the
					Welsh mining towns and the London slums, very little of it
					translates into a political reflection on the causes of ill health.
					Not unlike most doctors, Andrew tries to find meaning in the
					work he can do as an individual practitioner.
				</p>
				<p>
					And yet, the characters of <em>The Citadel</em> stay with you for a long
					time. Andrew is memorable. His dream of a happy domestic life
					in a small town practising sound medicine with a group of likeminded
					colleagues is endearing. His encounter with the widow
					of a former patient, who died as a result of a botched surgery,
					is remarkable: unsentimental and yet poignant. You read with
					dread and anticipation as he amputates a miner's trapped leg,
					down in a mine shaft. Christine, whose life is partly eclipsed
					by her husband's ambition, is still a woman who knows her
					own mind and who sticks to her principles, regardless of the
					pressure she may come under. And then there is Sir Robert
					Abbey, a kindly, though remote father figure, who watches over
					the career of the earnest Andrew Manson.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book is filled with numerous other minor
					characters-miners, doctors, patients, bureaucrats, and
					businessmen - who give us a taste of what life would have been
					like in the Britain of that time. <em>The Citadel</em> has no real villains,
					quite unlike Cronin's other books, except a faceless system
					which exploits patients and doctors alike. The alternative is,
					therefore, to look for an arrangement where doctors don't have
					to live off the misery of patients but can actually act in their
					interest while fulfilling their own. In the present context, where
					even this modest idealism is so severely compromised and
					the faith and trust between doctors and patients has almost
					disappeared, <em>The Citadel</em> is a reminder that our problems are
					not unique or new. And with its undefeated optimism, despite
					the odds, the vision of <em>The Citadel</em> is still to be cherished.
