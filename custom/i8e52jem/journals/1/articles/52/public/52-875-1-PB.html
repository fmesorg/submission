				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Complications related to the use of new diagnostic and therapeutic  														techniques are inherent to innovation in medicine. Appropriate  														consent should be obtained before subjecting patients to these  														techniques. In spite of doing this, when a complication does occur,  														one can easily relate to its devastating impact on the patient and  														his/her relatives. The toll that such events take on the treating  														physician also needs to be considered. The burden of conscience  														when a patient consents to such a procedure with implicit faith in  														the physician is immense.
				</p>
				<p>
					A case of irreversible paraplegia due to non-target embolisation  														of the anterior spinal artery in a young lady undergoing bronchial  														artery embolisation for hemoptysis is discussed. A feeling of  														"sadness and guilt" and a scientific analysis of the cause for the  														adverse event result in changing the protocol of the procedure  														leading to increased safety for future patients. Wide consultation  														with colleagues and help from institutional review boards are  														useful in assuring the treating physician about the justification  														of performing such procedures and help in coping should  														complications occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					The manner in which these events are managed, especially by  														medical teachers in teaching hospitals, is an important learning  														point for medical students and doctors in training. The need for  														appropriate open forums in institutions is emphasised, where  														such events are shared by physicians, resulting in unburdening  														themselves and potentially in education for all present.

				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					In 1982-83, my colleagues and I at the Department of Radiology,  														KEM Hospital, in Mumbai, started performing bronchial artery  														embolisations (BAE) for the treatment of massive haemoptysis, ie  														blood in the sputum, due to pulmonary tuberculosis. I had read  														the literature around this and realised that performing bronchial  														artery embolisation was fairly straightforward and could be done  														with the instruments, equipment and skill we had.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before each intervention, we would explain the procedure to  														the patient. We mentioned the usual complications associated  														with femoral catheterisation. We added that if the procedure  														failed, we might have to redo it and if even that failed, an  														operation might be needed to remove the affected lung. From  														my reading of the literature, I did not think that any other  														complication was common enough to merit explanation to  														the patient or the patient's family. As many of these patients  														had presented to us in the emergency, and most patients were  														deeply disturbed by the hemoptysis, almost all patients readily  														consented to undergo the procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a couple of months, we had successfully embolised and  														treated about half a dozen of these patients with good results  														and without incident.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this time, we let our resident doctors perform these  														procedures under our supervision (I was a lecturer then).  														This went on for a few months and the procedure became a  														standard of care at our hospital.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Case report</h4>
				<p>
					The following incident occurred about a year after this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient was a young woman between 25 and 30 years  														of age. She had presented to the casualty with 300-400 ml  														of haemoptysis. As per our protocol, she was taken up for  														embolisation around 8 pm. As the resident started doing the  														procedure, I stood behind, guiding him. The procedure was  														performed under local anaesthesia by retrograde femoral  														catheterisation. The embolisation went off uneventfully and  														was completed in about 45 minutes. When we removed the  														sterile sheets off the patient, my resident asked the patient to  														lift her legs so the blood at the femoral puncture site could be  														cleaned off. She said, "I am not able to move my leg." I heard  														the patient say that ' but did not pay much attention until the  														resident came into an adjacent room a few minutes later and  														told me, "The patient seems to have developed paraplegia."
				</p>
				<p>
					I went in to examine the patient. She was indeed paraplegic  														with power zero in both lower limbs ' from hip to toes. The  														sensations in her lower limbs seemed impaired. I vividly  														remember noticing the over-distended bladder in the lower  														abdomen and when I asked her if she wanted to pass urine,  														she said, "I do not feel like it," which was the opposite of what  														most patients who have just undergone angiography usually  														say. I then slowly realised that she had lost bladder sensations,  														too. I was deeply worried by this. I immediately understood  														what could have happened: inadvertently, we seemed to have  														embolised the spinal artery. I then reviewed the images and  														though we had embolised a common intercosto-bronchial  														trunk, I could not see any spinal artery arising from this. My  														colleague from neurology examined the patient and confirmed  														that the patient's clinical findings were indeed due to anterior  														spinal artery (ASA) occlusion. He suggested giving methyl  														prednisolone. It was very expensive in those days and as the  														patient could not afford it, she was instead given a high dose  														of dexamethasone ' for what it was worth. I talked to the  														patient as she lay on the table and told her that in a few days  														she should be getting better. After urinary catheterisation, we  														sent her to the ward. Her husband was waiting outside the  														cath lab. I explained to him what had happened, and that we  														did not know how long it would take for her to recover. He did  														not seem agitated by this, said something like: "It will become  														alright, no?" to which I gave a non-committal reply.
				</p>

				<h4>The aftermath</h4>
				<p>
					I recall being completely shattered by this incident. I was  														travelling home that night by a public transport bus at 11 pm.  														I was so deep in thought that I missed the stop at which I was  														to alight. I had trouble sleeping that night and was back at the  														hospital early the next morning to examine the patient, hoping  														for a dramatic improvement. That was not to be. The patient's  														neurological status remained unchanged; but, the haemoptysis  														had ceased.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I discussed the patient and her angiographic images  														with my seniors in the department later that morning, they  														were very supportive. They said that the ASA could not be  														seen on the angiograms even in retrospect and that they too  														would have done the embolisation as we had. But, that was no  														comfort.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later that day, reading extensively on this, I learnt that  														paraplegia was a well-documented but very rare complication  														of BAE, with no specific treatment recommended. And the  														recommended technique was not to embolise any vessel with  														a suspect ASA arising from it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the next few days, when I visited the patient in the ward,  														I realised that though there was no improvement, the relatives  														seemed to have accepted this complication. The patient  														herself was just anxious to get home. I remember her being in  														the wards for about two weeks. The power in her lower limbs  														had improved minimally but the sensations had returned to  														normal. She, however, continued to have retention of urine. The  														last I remember seeing this patient on follow-up was about  														six months later, when I ran into her in our physiotherapy  														department. She was walking with support and had Grade 3-4  														power in the lower limbs. The bladder remained paralysed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ironically the patient and her husband seemed grateful that  														she was improving.
				</p>
				<p>
					After this complication, we changed our protocol during BAE.  														We would closely analyse the images to look for ASA and  														especially if an intercostal bronchial trunk was present. We  														would carefully rule out the presence of an ASA. We would also  														constantly monitor the patient for power and sensations in the  														lower limbs throughout the procedure. The patient was also  														told to report immediately if he/she felt heaviness or numbness  														in the lower limbs.
				</p>

				<h4>Thinking back</h4>
				<p>
					In my career as an interventional radiologist, I have had my fair  														share of complications, both major and minor. Some required  														urgent surgical treatment and others resulted in disability and  														death' especially in interventional procedures involving the  														brain. So I wondered why this particular complication, a nonfatal  														one which occurred almost 30 years ago, strikes me as  														being the most poignant.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not as if we have not performed "first-time" procedures in  														our department, based mainly on reading the literature, or by  														improvisation using available resources. Occasionally these too  														have resulted in complications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Viewed against this background, our performing the first  														bronchial artery embolisation based merely on our experience  														of vascular catheterisation and intervention was not unusual.  														I had discussed performing BAEs with three of my colleagues  														and the predominant question was: "Can we do the proceduredo  														we have the skill?" The answer was a unanimous 'Yes'. We  														felt that the worst that could happen was that we would fail  														and the patient might need surgery. I do not recall actively  														discussing paraplegia as a complication of this procedure.  														Also, since no one else we knew had done this procedure, the  														question of seeking others' advice in the matter did not arise.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what was so different about this patient? The   difference  														strikes me very clearly. In almost every other   complication,the patient had been cautioned about the possibility of an  														untoward event '  														for example in interventions on the brain,  														death or irreversible neurological deficit is explained as   a small  														but real possibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					The complication in this patient was unrelated to the disease  														that the patient presented with. She was a young lady in the  														prime of her life, trusting herself to us to treat a "simple" disease  														such as TB and a not really life threatening symptom such as  														haemoptysis. She walked in to the angio suite, climbed up on  														the table herself and should by rights have walked home in  														a day or two, completely cured of the disease. Instead, she  														developed a permanent disability. Worse, neither the patient  														nor her relatives nor we were prepared for such a complication.  														It was as if we had short-changed the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was the additional guilt that neither the patient nor her  														husband really blamed us for the complication. The fatalism  														with which they accepted it was humbling. I wondered: Were  														we using our patients as guinea pigs?
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the fact that no spinal artery could be seen, we seemed  														to have exercised reasonable care in examining the films.  														However, if we were aware of the possibility of paraplegia, we  														would have clinically monitored the patient and this could  														have reduced the morbidity in this patient. To me, this appears  														to be the greatest failing in this case. And so this case troubled  														me then, and troubles me still, in spite of assurances from  														colleagues and seniors in the department; and a part of my  														own brain telling me that it was not my "fault". And, then the  														issue of patient consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients visiting large teaching hospitals in Mumbai and  														elsewhere in India are usually from the lower socio-economic  														strata of society and cannot afford healthcare costs elsewhere.  														It is often difficult to explain to these patients the technical  														details and consequences of such procedures. They come to  														the doctor with implicit faith that he or she will do no harm.  														And when we do seek consent for a procedure such as the one  														in this case, it is very common for the patient to say: "Do what  														you feel is right; you are like God to us." Though we are so used  														to hearing these words and take them for granted, this in no  														way diminishes the great responsibility that it puts on doctors '  														namely, to think for and act on behalf of the patient and her  														family. It may also be possible that this implicit faith is a reason  														why patients are often so forgiving when complications occur,  														as happened in this case. In such a context, when things go  														wrong, the whole 'burden of conscience' weighs heavily on the  														physician obtaining consent and performing the procedure  														on the patient. I have never been able to determine for myself  														whether such blanket trust and faith are good for the patient,  														or even for the physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thankfully, however, in the last 15-20 years, we have our ethics  														and institutional review boards in place. These often act as  														checks and balances preventing gross misadventures or at least  														providing the institutional support of many minds in carrying  														out new and innovative procedures on patients. These help us  														put in perspective the interests of patient care and the need for  														medical research and progress.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of BAE procedures that we had performed, the  														first half-dozen or so were uneventful and successful and this  														emboldened us to perform them as a matter of routine. It is  														interesting to speculate on the impact of complications in  														such initial procedures. If complications occur early on in our  														experience with such new techniques, they could result in  														the procedure being abandoned or lead to greater thought,  														greater caution and review of the technique itself. The initial  														and overall success of this procedure helped us spread this  														technique with optimism throughout the country; while this  														complication helped us emphasise the need for unwavering  														caution at all times while performing BAE.

				<h4>Impact</h4>
				<p>
					In the 20-25 years since this complication, we have performed  														hundreds of BAEs and I recall at least five more such  														complications, each recognised in time before complete  														embolisation, and each of these patients has recovered more  														or less completely.
				</p>
				<p>
					What impact do these complications have on physician  														performance? Do they have long term adverse effects? In my  														own case this and similar cases have had no short or long-term  														negative impact on my performance as a radiologist. Even in  														the days around this complication, my ability to work on other  														patients remained unaffected. However, these cases do provide  														long term education and temper one's practice. A search of  														the PubMed database does not reveal a single other report  														of a similar nature from a radiologic practice point of view.  														However, there are many reports from other specialities that  														show impact on physician performance after such incidences <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gazoni FM, Amato PE, Malik ZM, Durieux ME.

				</p>
				<p>
					In our country, instances such as these bring into sharp  														focus the reasons why we should be eternally grateful to the  														patients who visit teaching hospitals for treatment. Often, they  														unquestioningly submit themselves to our care and, even under  														adverse circumstances, do not question our judgment. Thus, well  														beyond medical care, the burden of responsibility for the overall  														well-being of the patient falls on the treating physician and  														this burden can be immense. These provide rare but invaluable  														opportunities for the medical teacher to teach medical students  														and doctors-in-training, both by precept and by practice, how  														best to shoulder these dual roles ' the easier one of being the  														treating physician, and the more difficult one of being forced to  														think and decide for the patient and his family.
