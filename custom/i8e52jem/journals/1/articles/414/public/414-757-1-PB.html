<h4>AIDS Sutra: untold stories from India.Random House India: 2008. 334 pages. ISBN 13579108642 </h4>
				<p>
					"Literature... has been, in a way a great ally of science in making
					us discern the world better-a hugely important contribution
					that still does not get adequate attention," observes Amartya
					Sen in his thought-provoking foreword to AIDS Sutra - untold
					stories from India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book is a testimony to this statement for various reasons.
					Sixteen eminent authors have used their medium to tell us
					about the human stories associated with HIV/ AIDS. They have
					spent time, interacted and empathised with the protagonists
					and this comes across in their touching portrayals and
					published photographs.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also need to remind ourselves that AIDS is a disease like no
					other in medicine. Along with social, cultural and behavioural
					issues it is associated with stigma, discrimination and very
					little sympathy. Moreover, the nature and reach of this disease
					with its varied modes of spread emphasise that it is important
					to know your patient better than the disease. As physicians,
					we just see HIV/AIDS as a global epidemic and a challenge to
					medicine. Reading these stories gives us an insight into the
					social issues related to the disease which are equally important
					in preventing and controlling the epidemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					To the general reader, the book helps in understanding the
					disease through real life experiences and this can be a step in
					sensitising society towards HIV/AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Society has made women double victims of HIV/AIDS. They
					are vulnerable not just to the disease but also to the trauma
					of stigmatisation, domestic violence and unequal treatment.
					A number of essays in the book centre around female sex
					workers and women living with HIV/AIDS and common to all
					of them is the threat of contracting the disease if they haven't,
					and the dread of abandonment if they have.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another group of people who are treated with revulsion are the
					third gender. Salman Rushdie in his essay wonders how we can
					humiliate the Ardhanaris and also worship Ardhanarishwara.
					Other contributions bring out the torment faced by men who
					have sex with men and this again focuses on the urgent need
					to revamp old laws and legalise certain sexual practices to
					encourage openness. Talking about laws brings into picture
					its guardians-the police-who are sadly both victims and
					offenders. Through the blood they come in contact with,
					and the free sex they demand, they also acquire the virus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sonia Faleiro gives an account of this vicious nexus between
					policemen, sex workers and outreach workers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amit Chaudhari's 'Healing' takes us to the doctors in Mumbai
					who are working towards controlling the disease and are
					seeing encouraging results with antiretroviral treatment.
					Given the present scenario, the future demands many more
					such committed professionals along with huge investments in
					infrastructure. Unless great progress is made in prevention, the
					number of people living with HIV will outstrip the resources
					available for treatment. The enormity of this situation is
					touched upon in Jaspreet Singh's essay 'Bhoot ki Kahaniyan'.
					When he interacts with AIDS orphans and reminisces that he
					met only 34 and wonders where the other 1.9 million are, it is a
					haunting moment in the book.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stoic strength is seen in many of the stories but one that is
					unique in this respect is Nikita Lalwani's contribution. This is
					the story of a successful doctor whose HIV positive status is
					revealed to him by all his family members following a shocking
					breach of confidentiality by the hospital where he was a blood
					donor for his relative. Stigmatised, he migrates, finds acceptance
					as a doctor in Chennai at a leading centre for AIDS research
					and then takes his battle for breach of confidentiality, followed
					by marital rights for HIV positive people, to the Supreme Court.
					Ironically, though the case is "Mr X versus Hospital Y" his name
					gets splashed in the papers. Today he is content with his work
					at the centre and runs a marriage counselling centre for HIV
					positive people. Besides marvelling at his fortitude this essay
					stresses the importance of confidentiality and human rights.
					There is also a message in it for us - to discourage directed
					blood donations and reduce relative blood donation. Apart
					from the immunological risks involved in directed donation,
					a reactive screening report leads to compromise in donor
					confidentiality and can damage relationships when the family
					is already under strain. Encouraging regular voluntary blood
					donation is the best way to ensure both donor privacy and
					patient safety. As regards the issue of blood donor disclosure,
					NACO has taken a much needed step in the right direction. It
					is now the right of the donor to know his screening status
					and also the responsibility of the blood bank to disclose the
					information to the donor and refer all those who test positive
					for counselling.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, trying to close the gap between people living with
					HIV/AIDS and the community could be our tribute to those
					who have contributed to this anthology.
