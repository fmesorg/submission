				<h4>Institutional ethics committees and stem cell
				research</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of
					Biotechnology has issued draft guidelines for stem cell research
					<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research and Department of Biotechnology. ICMR-DBT Draft Guidelines for Stem Cell Research. 2012 Mar [cited 2013 Jun 12]. Available from: http://icmr.nic. in/stem_cell_guidelines.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>
					in 2012. A thorough discussion among ethics committee members is necessary to improve these guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					As per these guidelines, it is necessary to form a separate
					institutional committee for stem cell research (IC-SCR) to review
					and approve the scientific merit of research protocols. All
					institutes involved in stem cell research must register with the
					National Apex Committee for Stem Cell Research and Therapy
					through the IC-SCR.
				</p>
				<p>
					The guidelines assert the need for a separate mechanism for
					review of stem cell projects. However, they then state that an
					institutional ethics committee (IEC) with appropriate expertise
					may also approve stem cell projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though ethics committees have experts, they are expected
					to review the ethics and not the scientific and technical
					details of a project. However, the draft guidelines empower
					the IEC to approve the science of a project as well. This seems
					contradictory to the standard operating procedures of ethics
					committees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the draft guidelines do not specify the minimum
					number of scientific experts required in an IEC to approve a
					project, or the experts' required qualifications. Nor do they
					discuss whether it is necessary to incorporate these experts
					as members with voting rights, or whether they need only be
					invited members for the work in hand.
				</p>
				<p>
					The IC-SCR's role includes registering the institute with the
					National Apex Committee and sending annual progress reports
					to this committee. If members of the National Apex Committee
					make visits to an institutional facility, the IC-SCR members may
					play a role in facilitating this process. The members are also
					expected to keep abreast of advances in the field as there is
					unpredictability in the translation of research in this area.
				</p>
				<p>
					If IECs may approve stem cell-related projects, will they be able
					to carry out this role effectively? If they are expected to do
					so, the standard operating procedures of IECs will have to be
					revised accordingly. Further, this relaxation of the rules will be used by scientists to get stem cell projects approved through
					an IEC, instead of setting up a new IC-SCR even when experts
					are available. This could adversely affect the quality of research.

				<h4>An insight into the medical humanities</h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						"Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability."
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="right">
					&mdash;Sir William Osler
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>IJME</em> has rightly focused on the medical humanities with a view
					to sensitising doctors towards their duties and responsibilities
					as well as towards an awareness of patients as human beings,
					to be treated with dignity. The articles related to medical
					humanities emphasise the need to include medical humanities
					as a subject in medical education to make it a holistic teaching
					and learning experience <a class="reference" href="#section-two_one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nayak D. Sensitising doctors: a pedagogical approach to medical humanities. Indian J Med Ethics. 2012;9:252-4." id="section-two_1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#section-two_two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Supe A. Medical humanities in the undergraduate medical curriculum Indian J Med Ethics. 2012;9:263-5." id="section-two_2">2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical humanities is primarily concerned with enlarging the
					scope of education and socialisation of healthcare professionals
					through a study of the arts, literature, social sciences, and law,
					including critiques of the dominant scientific model in the basic
					medical sciences. The subject seeks complementarity between
					science and the humanities <a class="reference" href="#section-two_three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rodenhauser P, Strickland MA, Gambalaa CT. Arts-related activities across U.S. medical schools: a follow-up study. Teach Learn Med. 2004;16:233-9." id="section-two_3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#section-two_four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Charon R. Narrative medicine: form, function, and ethics. Ann Intern Med. 200l;134:83-7." id="section-two_4">4)</a>. The intention of including humanities in the science of medicine is to enhance the human side of the physician which will guide his relationship with the patient, the nursing team, other health personnel and the kith and kin of the patient. Therefore, medical humanities must help the physician to develop intrapersonal and inter-personal relationships with his team and the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Along with clinical skills, the moral sensitivity of the practicing
					physician needs to be sharpened and guided. This is partly done
					by teaching medical ethics. Medical ethics may be considered as
					a tool that bridges the humanities and medicine. For example,
					the term "reverence for life" teaches that a doctor needs to
					respect human life and human dignity <a class="reference" href="#section-two_four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheriff DS. Medical ethics and reverence for life, Eubios J Asian Int Bioeth. 2003;13:224-6." id="section-two_4">(4)</a>
					.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the present-day context, there is less of humanitarianism and more of science in the practising doctor's schedule because
					of the constraints of time and space. How can one sensitise a
					doctor to human feelings such as compassion, empathy and
					other emotional aspects of life? Literature can teach and refine a person, for a doctor is also a human person <a class="reference" href="#section-two_six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheriff DS. Literature and medical ethics. JRSM. 1988;12:688-90" id="section-two_6">(6)</a>
					. Today, even the media focuses on the importance of humanitarianism in medical practice. Some examples are television serials such as <em>Grey's Anatomy, House</em> and <em>ER</em> that can be shown to medical graduates and medical professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Grey's Anatomy</em> (2005 onwards) is a prime time television
					medical drama airing on American Broadcasting Company
					(ABC), which follows Meredith Grey, a first-year surgical intern
					and her fellow interns as they struggle to become doctors <a class="reference" href="#section-two_seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ryan M. The Watcher: Shonda Rhimes, creator of 'Grey's Anatomy' and a Chicagoan of the Year. Chicago: Chicago Tribune.com. 2005 Dec 21[cited 2013 Jun 12]. Available from: http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/ entertainment_tv/2005/12/shonda_rhimes_a.htm" id="section-two_7">(7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#section-two_eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rhodes, J. Thriving ratings for a new patient on ABC. The New York Times[Internet]. 2005 Apr 14[cited 2013 Jun 12]. Available from: http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A04E2DA133EF937A25757 C0A9639C8B63" id="8"> 8)</a>. In one scene from this serial, an intern gives birth to
					a premature baby. Despite all neonatal care, the baby has
					to undergo an interventional surgery, which will however
					severely compromise the quality of the baby's life. The doctor
					asks the mother to decide what she wants&mdash;a baby with many
					handicaps affecting the quality of life, or allowing the baby
					to die without the surgery. She is unable to decide and looks
					to her partner, another doctor, to decide on her behalf. The
					partner tells her it is not his decision. She as a mother must
					decide what she wants for her baby-a living "dead" baby or
					a dead baby. The scene depicts the dilemma as to whether
					the doctor in the mother has to decide or the mother in the
					doctor needs to take a decision; the woman in question is
					both a doctor and a mother.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical professionals encounter many such situations in their
					day-to-day life, sometimes making them uncertain as to what
					they must do and looking for answers elsewhere. Answers in certain conditions are not simple. Medical humanities sensitises
					the doctor to the social and moral aspects to enable more
					informed and better decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I end with the observation that we need to introspect on the
					human in all of us.
