			<h3>Monitoring misuse of the WHO name and emblem in medicine promotion in India</h3>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The World Health Organisation has called for the ethical promotion
					of medicines. This study to monitor the misuse of the WHO name
					and emblem in medicine promotion in India found that the name or
					emblem of WHO has been used extensively for unethical promotion
					of drugs, nutritional supplements and consumer products in
					India. This nethical promotion is evident in advertisements,
					pharmaceutical indices and other publicity material.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					It is commonly believed that doctors are aware of unethical
					practices and corruption in the medical profession but most of
					them prefer to keep quiet about it. Thus the general perception
					is that doctors are part of the conspiracy of silence and secrecy
					and most refuse to stick their necks out <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malpani Aniruddha and Malpani Anjali. Medical ethics: How to do what is right. In: Successful medical practice: Winning strategies for doctors. Hyderabad: PTN Communications; 2005. p. 240-7." id="1">(1)</a>. Doctors must not
					forget that they have social obligations and must use their
					knowledge and skills to save society from medical exploitation.
					This includes unethical medicine promotion and propaganda.
					For, if doctors do not take a stand on such issues, then who will?
				</p>
				<p>
					Indian dental and medical professional associations are busy
					endorsing consumer products as our cricketers do, and have
					come to be referred to as the Indian Colgate Association and
					the Indian Dettol Association. A recent editorial (that read
					more like an advertorial) of the Journal of <em>Indian Medical
					Association (JIMA)</em> commented: "IMA and Eureka Forbes Limited,
					a manufacturing company responsible to introduce the world
					class water filter and water purifier system in our country jointly
					take up the awareness programme across the country about
					the role and need of pure water..." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Daga S. Partially fulfilled vision - Let us look ahead. Editorial. JIMA [serial on the internet]. 2007 Jan [cited 2007 Apr 19]; Available from: http://www.jimaonline.org.in/Jan2007/January2007_2.htm" id="2">(2)</a>

				<p>
					We have been noticing the use of the World Health
					Organisation (WHO) name and its emblem in medicine
					promotion and thought of studying it further as a voluntary
					project. We searched the WHO-Health Action International drug promotion database www.drugpromo.info for studies on the misuse of the WHO name and emblem, but did not find any. However we did find a recent study commissioned and sponsored by the WHO-India office whose findings indicate the institutionalisation of blatantly unethical and illegal promotional practices by drug companies in Mumbai, India <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roy N, Madhiwalla N, Pai SA. Drug promotional practices in Mumbai: a qualitative survey. Indian J Med Ethics 2007 Apr-Jun; 4 (2): 57-61." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					During a field exercise in a training course on promoting
					rational use of medicines in the community, conducted with
					WHO South East Asian Regional Office (March 1-8, 2006),
					participants were asked to bring to the class oral rehydration
					solution (ORS) packs with the WHO name and emblem. The
					data were subsequently published <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bachewar N, Thawani V, Gharpure K. Are ORS brands in India using WHO name judiciously? Indian Journal of Pharmacology 2006 Dec; 38 (6):439- 41." id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since WHO's ethical criteria for medicine promotion must be
					adopted, published and disseminated, and compliance with the
					criteria monitored on a continuous basis <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tomson G. National drug policies and drug utilization. In: Education on rational drug use: Proceedings of continuing medical education programme on clinical pharmacology. New Delhi: Department of Pharmacology, Maulana Azad Medical College; 1993. p. 11- 31," id="5">(5)</a> we planned this
					study to monitor the misuse of the WHO name and emblem in
					medicine promotion in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the initial findings of our study were presented at a
					WHO/UNICEF technical briefing seminar on essential medicines
					policies, at the WHO Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland
					(September 18-22, 2006).

				<h4>Promotional statements in the name of WHO</h4>
				<p>
					Many companies make statements quoting WHO. The
					references quoted in such promotions are grossly incomplete,
					making cross verification difficult. For example, Raptakos, Brett  &amp; Co Ltd, in its advertisement for <em>Hepatoglobine</em>, states that
					"Anemia is independently associated with increased mortalityWHO (World Health Organisation)." The reference for this
					statement has been given as "<em>Archives of Internal Medicine</em> Vol
					165 No 19, October 2005 <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Advertisement of M/s Raptakos, Brett &amp; Co. Ltd. Mumbai, India. Quarterly Medical Review. 2006 Oct-Dec. 57 (4)." id="6">(6)</a>". This does not disclose the names
					of the author(s) or the page numbers of the journal where it
					has been published.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another company has been creating a fear psychosis by stating:
					"2010: India will have 100 million heart patients, 2015: Heart
					diseases will replace infectious diseases as a major killer, 2025:
					Nearly half of India's population will suffer from heart ailments"
					in the name of a WHO report, the reference for which is not
					given <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Advertisement of M/s Chandra Bhagat Pharma Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai. CIMS 2006 Jan - Apr: 169." id="1">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can we deduce from these examples that the missing details
					vital for valid verification have been deliberately omitted?
				</p>

				<h4>In the name of WHO GMP certification</h4>
				<p>
					WHO does not give "good manufacturing practice" (GMP)
					certification to any unit but it recommends in its manual how
					a "WHO type" certificate should be given by a drug regulatory
					authority <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products with special reference to multisource (generic) products: A manual for drug regulatory authority. Regulatory support series, No 5. Geneva: WHO;1999." id="8">(8)</a>. The manual specifies that certificates should not
					bear the WHO emblem (para 4.1, page 89). It mentions that
					marketing authorisation may be suspended or revoked if the
					product is being promoted in an inappropriate or unethical
					manner (para VIII, page 32). Yet, in India, we see pharmaceutica companies indulging in various unethical permutations and
					combinations such as:

				</ul>
				In some promotions, the claim of WHO GMP status has been
				made even before the plants became operational. It is like
				starting a new medical college with the claim that it is Medical
				Council of India (MCI) compliant!

				<p>
					Some examples:

						"WHO GMP compliance unit opening shortly!" <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="IDR M/s Osper Formulations, Baddi, Dist, Solan. P 50, Nov-Dec 2006." id="29">(29)</a>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The certification mania has reached such proportions that those
					wanting to buy an operational pharmaceutical manufacturing
					plant are asking for a WHO GMP approved unit <a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Economic Times, Mumbai. 26 Mar 2007." id="32">(32)</a>.
					In advertising job openings, some companies have described

					company's masthead <a class="reference" href="#thirtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Times of India, Nagpur. M/s Comed Chemicals Ltd. Baroda. 11 Apr 2007." id="33">(33)</a>.

					carried in national dailies known for ethical journalism.
				</p>
				<p>
					We did not come across a single advertisement in international

				<h4>Promotingmedicines as having received WHO

				<p>
					WHO has a scheme of prequalifying the medicines and commits

					learnt does not seem to apply to India, for we can report use of prequalification status in the advertising of a branded product
					-<em> Rabipur</em>. The joint advertisement by Sanofi Aventis and Chiron
					vaccines claims that their "PCEC vaccine is WHO-prequalified
					and recommended for purchase by UN agencies" <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Journal of Internal Medicine Sup1, 11: 3,P2, 2001." id="35">(35)</a>.

				<h4>In the name of WHO modellist of essentialmedicines</h4>
				<p>
					Themis Medicare Ltd, Mumbai, promoted its antimalarial
					combination of lumefantrine with artemether, <em>Lumether</em>, as a
					"WHO recommended artemisinin combination therapy for
					malaria" and in its product flyer used the words "<em>Lumether</em> included in WHO Model list of Essential Medicines Core list
					(revised March 2005)". The copywriters committed the blunder
					of magnifying para 6.5.3.1 of the Essential Medicines List
					relating to antimalarial medicines which says that "for curative
					treatment medicines for the treatment of P Falciparium
					malaria cases should be used in combination Armether +
					Lumefantrine."
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>How WHO displayed with on ORS products</h4>
				<p>
					The capacity of the pharmaceutical industry to counter any
					move towards rational therapy should not be underestimated.
					The industry introduced high price ORS packs after
					discovering the popular swing towards the rational therapy
					of diarrhoea <a class="reference" href="#thirtysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chandrasekar S, Sethuraman KR, Shashindran CH, Oumachigui A, Ananthakrishnan N, Srinivasan S, Adithan C editors.

Pondicherry: Educators of quality update of Indian physicians (EQUIP); 1995. p. 45-49." id="36">(36)</a>. While the WHO-recommended ORS formula
					was adopted by the industry, it was not without commercial
					exploitation of WHO's name. Due to the confusion in ORS
					formulations available in the market, even the literate find it
					difficult identifying what exactly is recommended by WHO,
					which composition is correct and most recent, and whether
					WHO recommends the orange/lemon flavours of ORS. Patients
					are routinely advised to dissolve the whole ORS pouch in one
					litre of water. If the patient buys a smaller pouch the end result
					can well be imagined. We found so many versions of the WHO
					name/emblem on ORS products in India that it was difficult
					for us to identify which one was correct. Given below are the
					company names and their claims <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bachewar N, Thawani V, Gharpure K.

					Since ORS is a big market segment, brands are heavily advertised.

					</li>
					<li>
						The ad for BioRS, a combination of ORS and Synbiotic, is

						and Walyte. They have used the WHO ORS emblem together
						with copy that says that the mother and father of Raju did not

						Raju lagged behind Nandu. Accompanying the copy are
						pictures of two boys aged three years, in which Raju is shown

					The 46th WHO Assembly in 1993 requested member states
					to "develop policy guidelines on the use and protection of
					international nonproprietary names (INN), and to discourage
					names derived from INNs, and particularly names including
					established INN stems as trade marks" (resolution WHA 46.19), as
					such use can frustrate the rational selection of further INNs for

				<h4>WHO name and emblem in vaccine promotion</h4>
				<p>
					ARV manufacturers have been in the forefront of using the
					WHO name. Earlier publications by Aventis and later SanofiAventis relating to its brand Rabipur have been claiming "WHO
					recommended &amp; US FDA approved Rabipur". Recently, SanofiAventis distributed a table-top pen stand as promotional
					material, where the packing and the gift both mention "WHO
					recommended &amp; US FDA approved Rabipur". While this study is
					not commenting on the status of US FDA approval, it certainly
					objects to the repetitive use of the phrase "WHO recommended
					Rabipur".
				</p>
				<p>
					Ranbaxy Laboratories uses the WHO name in its flyers of
					Verorab and Bharat Serums &amp; Vaccines Ltd, Mumbai, mentions
					"dosage and administration of Rabglob as recommended by
					WHO".
				</p>
				<p>
					Another multinational GlaxoSmithKline, Mumbai, has been
					promoting its combination vaccine <em>Tritanrix HB + Hiberix </em>as
					"The only WHO approved pentavalent combination", and
					quotes the reference of www.who.int/vaccines-access/quality/
					un_prequalified <a class="reference" href="#fortythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="M/s Glaxo Smith Kline. Indian Pediatrics: back page (a) 43:2, Feb 2006 and (b) 43: 7, July 2006." id="43">(43)</a>. The obvious question is why should WHO
					recommend specific brands of vaccines?
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Use of WHO in promotion of nutritional supplements</h4>
				<p>
					Biomiicron Pharmaceuticals, Chennai, has used the WHO

					<em>Mother's Horlicks</em>, a product of Glaxo Smith Kline, is promoted
					with the claim that it "complies to WHO guidelines providing
					20% calories from proteins". There is no reference provided

				<h4>WHO on consumer products</h4>
				<p>
					The consumer product industry cannot afford to miss making
					hay while the WHO sun shines and the darkness in monitoring
					medicine promotion prevails. A mosquito repellant liquid
					refill - <em>Tortoise Ninja</em> (manufactured by Bombay Chemicals Pvt
					Ltd, Batch No LS 0013, Mfg date: 01/2006, MRP INR 45.00) has
					the WHO emblem on its product pack with the words "WHO
					recommended" and in fine print "NAK 4455 recommended for
					adoption by WHO. Reference report No 741/2002", whatever
					that means.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					A WHO publication <a class="reference" href="#fortysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Norris P, Herxheimer A, Joel L, Mansfield P. Drug promotion - What we know, what we have yet to learn, Reviews of materials in WHO/HAI database on drug promotion. World Health Organization, Health Action International, European Community; 2005. p. 72." id="46">(46)</a> has quoted the conclusion of others <a class="reference" href="#fortyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Silverman M, Lydecker M, Lee PR. Bad medicine: The prescription drug industry in the third world. Stanford University Press; 1992." id="47">(47)</a> that "most multinationals had improved considerably
					by the late 1980s. Local and domestic firms were now mainly
					responsible for inaccurate promotion. Silverman et al's
					books show a clear improvement over time in promotion
					in developing countries". We beg to differ with the learned
					authors. We found multinational giants indulging in such
					misrepresentations in India along with local and domestic
					firms. India is a developing country and if this is the state of
					"clear improvement" in medicine promotion, one wonders what
					could have been worse. There have been enough warnings
					that double standards might be adopted by pharmaceutical
					companies in following codes for medical advertising in
					developing countries <a class="reference" href="#fortyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thawani V. Drug promotion: Can self regulation work? Editorial. Indian J Pharmacology 2002; 34: 227-8 ." id="48">(48)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					But we do agree with the conclusion of Norris et al <a class="reference" href="#fortysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Norris P, Herxheimer A, Joel L, Mansfield P. Drug promotion - What we know, what we have yet to learn, Reviews of materials in WHO/HAI database on drug promotion. World Health Organization, Health Action International, European Community; 2005. p. 72." id="46">(46)</a> that
					"publication of descriptions of deceptive promotion can lead to
					improvements". So we hope that the concerned will take note
					of our exhibits and sanitise the filth in medicine promotion.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not clear what our central and regional committees that
					were constituted to tackle unethical promotion of medicines,
					are doing <a class="reference" href="#fortynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gopalkrishnan S, Murali R. India: campaign to tackle unethical promotion. EssentialDrug Monitor 2002; 31: 22." id="49">(49)</a> given the unregulated state of medicine promotion in India. Nor has the pharmaceutical industry spared
					the WHO name and emblem from blatant exploitation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Food and Drug Administration of the United States
					launched an initiative to help consumers obtain accurate, upto-date and scientific information about health consequences
					of foods and dietary supplements. It entered into an agreement
					with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality which
					reviews the claims before they appear on labels. Accordingly,
					an interim evidence based ranking system for scientific data
					has been introduced. The highest grade 'A' stands for significant
					scientific agreement about the health claim. 'B' is given to
					claims for which there is good scientific evidence supporting
					the claim but it is not entirely conclusive, 'C' for claims for which
					the evidence is limited and inconclusive and 'D' for claims with
					little scientific evidence <a class="reference" href="#fifty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nutraceuticals World 6:9: 26-28 part 1 of 2, Sep 2003. www.Nutraceuticalsworld.com." id="50">(50)</a>. If such a scientific approach can
					be adopted for nutritional products, how much more so is it
					needed for medicines, which are more hazardous. If claims
					made for medicines in promotional material are screened first,
					before they are allowed to go public, it would surely check the
					deviants.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the output of more than two years of research and due
					to constraints of manpower and resources all the misuse has
					not been exposed. Here is what readers can do if they notice
					misuse of the WHO name/emblem:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Catch the medicine promotion for errors of omission and
						commission.
					</li>
					<li>
						Scan the promotional material and save it. Procure hard
						copy evidence.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inform WHO authorities and active consumer organisations
						like CERC Ahmedabad, LOCOST Vadodara, VHAI New Delhi,
						NetRUM Nagpur about it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ask WHO to seek clarification from the concerned
						pharmaceutical company.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ask WHO to use the right to information (RTI) to get the
						details.
					</li>
					<li>
						Network and discuss in E-forums like E-drugs, IndPharm,
						NetRUM.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use personal media connectivity to counter the promotion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Lobby with politicians for effective legislative control of
						medicine promotion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Educate medical students and consumers about medicine
						promotion and train them in "ad-busting" <a class="reference" href="#thirtysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chandrasekar S, Sethuraman KR, Shashindran CH, Oumachigui A, Ananthakrishnan N, Srinivasan S, Adithan C editors.

						<br />
					</li>
					<li>
						Insist that scientific journals to which you subscribe have,
						and practices, editorial policy of rejecting unethical medicine
						promotion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Create a watchdog body to monitor unethical medicine
						promotion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Organise to file public interest litigation.

				<h4>Time to rewrite WHO ethical criteria</h4>
				<p>
					The WHO Ethical Criteria for Medicinal Promotion (WHO
					Geneva, 1988) was written decades ago and desperately
					needs to be updated. It is silent on such misuse of the WHO
				</p>
				<p>
					emblem and name as detailed above. It has become obsolete
					and outdated. It needs to encompass a warning for misuse of
					WHO emblem/name and should explicitly warn of legal action
					in such cases. It must spell out what WHO will do if its name/
					emblem is misused for medicine promotion. It is a tragi-comedy
					when the name/emblem of an organisation that recommends
					ethical criteria is unethically used.
