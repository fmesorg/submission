			<h2>CORRUPTION IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE</h2>
			<h3>In which wretched part of the world? A glimpse into western drug- and
			device-makers (and others) behaving badly</h3>
			<h4 class="author">JOHN J GILLON, JR</h4>
			<hr />
			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					A bioethics colleague wrote of the efforts of those in India &amp; who
					struggle each and every day in this wretched part of the world &amp;
					to eliminate corruption from the clinical and research practice of
					medicine, and from medical education.
				</p>
				<p>
					Wretchedness is the human condition. Corruption is endemic-
					and is a pandemic. Both have anchors as firm in the West as
					anywhere else in the world. The record of wretchedness-whether
					personal, corporate, institutional, or a combination thereof-is not
					measured in events, weeks, or months, but in patterns of practice
					often across decades.
				</p>
				<p>
					The conditions have no single home, residence, or country of
					origin. They exist when and where one abets acts or omissions that
					take advantage of power, or access to it, and adulterate or debase
					a system-particularly one of governance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer is to identify and share information on the problems
					and problem-makers, and so cooperate in efforts to increase
					transparency at all levels of medical research, care, and education.
					A reasoned first step in this regard would be the institution of a
					central website at which, inter alia, questioned research might
					be identified by journal, article, subject matter, publication date,
					and authors-and, where appropriate, company; specifics as to
					questioned data elements and history regarding communication
					to and with the authors as to the questioned data elements might
					be set forth; and some resolution of a matter might be posted.

					Present-day Merck began as a German firm in 1668, which
					crossed the Atlantic to open a US subsidiary in 1891. During
					World War I, the US assets of the firm were seized by the United
					States government, ending the corporate relationship with the
					German parent. The US Merck merged with Sharp &amp; Dohme
					(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) in 1953. After the 1971
					merger of Schering AG (Germany) with Plough, Inc (Memphis,
					Tennessee, USA), Merck and Schering-Plough began in 2000 to
					undertake joint ventures. This was followed first by the merger
					of Schering-Plough with Netherlands-based Organon in 2007
					and, finally, by the merger of Schering-Plough into Merck &amp; Co,
					Inc, in 2009 <a class="reference" href="#fourtynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Merck.com [Internet]. Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck and Co Inc; c2009- 2013 [cited 2013 Jun 23]. Available from: http://www.merck.com/index. html" id="49">(49)</a>.</p>
