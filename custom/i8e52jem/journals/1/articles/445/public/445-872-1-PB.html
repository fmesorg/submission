				<h4>Media portrayal of health professionals biased? </h4>
				<p>
					Over the last few years, the media have been repeatedly  													focusing on corruption in healthcare. Sometimes, speakers  													on television channels fling allegations at the entire medical  													community. This biased picture of pervasive corruption is  													resented by a majority of doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors have been charged with prescribing unnecessary and  													costly medicines instead of generic medicines. While there  													is a lot of difference between manufacturing cost and actual  													price of medicines, how can doctors be held responsible for  													deciding the price of a drug? It is the government that has to  													regulate the prices of essential medicines in association with  													pharmaceutical companies, not doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					In an alleged case of malpractice discussed in an episode  													of a popular television show, Mr R has accused doctors of a  													corporate hospital of mismanaging a case of cadaver transplant  													of the liver and pancreas of his wife (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sreedhara R. A letter from Dr R Sreedhara to Aamir Khan [Internet]. Aalatimes.com; 2012 Jun 07[cited 2013 Mar 31]. Available from: http://www.aalatimes.com/2012/06/07/a-letter-from-dr-r-sreedhara-to- aamir-khan/" id="1">1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK.

A nephrologist at that  													hospital contradicted this saying that Mr. R had withheld crucial  													information which may have made viewers believe his version.  													He mentions that Mr R had withheld the fact that the state  													Medical Council had thoroughly investigated the case and  													found no evidence of negligence by doctors. The nephrologist  													has also mentioned that: "The patient and her family were  													all informed about the risks and benefits of transplantation,  													more than a year prior to the surgery and informed consent  													was taken. The patient had developed a massive bleeding  													condition called Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation  													(DIC). She received platelets and other blood products to  													correct the DIC. The surgeon was fully qualified to conduct  													pancreatic transplantation as well as kidney transplantation  													and had conducted numerous multi-organ transplantation  													surgeries. The hospital was also registered for multi-organ  													transplantation."<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK.

Television channels and other mass  													media should confirm the authenticity of information before  													telecasting it to the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The numbers of doctors' licences cancelled in some developed  													countries and in India have been compared time and again  													by the media; but no comparison is made of the number  													of physical attacks on doctors while on duty in India and  													elsewhere, or of the number of people convicted of such  													offences; or of stipends, working conditions, duty hours,  													or accommodation provided to medical students and  													doctors. Even basic infrastructure and facilities like clean  													drinking water, subsidised canteens, separate toilets for  													women, are not provided in Indian government hospitals <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK. Doctor, heal thyself [Internet]. Aalatimes.com. 2012 Jun 01[cited 2013 Mar 31]. Available from: http://www.aalatimes.com/2012/06/01/ doctor-heal-thyself/" id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The media preaches that brilliant students who take up  													medicine should consider it only as service to mankind;  													they should go to other fields if they want to live a good life.  													Why impose the burden of charity and social service only on  													medical professionals? It takes almost thirteen years for a  													doctor to reach specialist status, with a compulsory year of  													government service after graduation. In fact, doctors are the  													worst paid professionals for the hard work and dedication  													they put in. Why are only doctors being forced to work in rural  													and government hospitals after completing their education?  													The rural sector surely needs the help of other qualified  													professionals as well. Why aren't they compelled to do public  													service after graduation, or prevented from going abroad for  													better facilities as doctors are? In spite of all the hardships,  													even today, the medical profession has a fairly large number of  													selfless and sensitive professionals <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Public Health Foundation of India, National Health Systems Resource Centre, State Health Systems Resource Centre.

Available at:http://health.cg.gov.in/ehealth/studyreports/Why%20 Some%20Doctors%20Serve%20in%20Rural%20Areas.pdf" id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>The media should present a balanced picture of the profession and exert pressure on the authorities to act against corrupt health professionals. If the media continue to mention only the darker side of profession, it will hurt the country's healthcare system &ndash; the public will lose faith in doctors and a large number of students who aspire to be doctors will be dissuaded from
			    doing so.</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					I would like to point out some similarities regarding corruption  													in healthcare, between India and Peru, two middle-income  													countries in different continents. According to Transparency  													International, India and Peru have a Corruption Perception  													Index of 3.1 and 3.4, respectively (http://www.transparency.  													org/country). This same entity provides the Global Corruption  													Barometer, in which statistics show that 85% of surveyed  													Peruvians assess as "ineffective" the current government's  													actions in the fight against corruption; whereas in India, this  													opinion is held by 44% of surveyed Indians. In both countries,  													many cases of corruption are due to overcharging for supplies,  													infrastructure and new equipment, and to favours that benefit  													only a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Statistics from the Global Corruption Barometer (http://gcb.  													transparency.org/gcb201011/) indicate that in India, 21% of  													people have come into contact with medical services, and 26%  													of them have paid a bribe in this kind of institution in the last  													twelve months; on the other hand, for Peru it is reported that  													72% of people have come into contact with medical services,  													and of them only 4% have paid a bribe, These differences are  													perhaps a clear indication that, where there is more corruption,  													less people may have the willingness to go to a health facility.  													However, this hypothesis should be further explored in  													different contexts, in order to arrive to a solid conclusion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corruption is a global problem, and definitely affects a  													population's 's health <a class="reference" href="#section-two_three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nishtar S. Corruption in health systems. Lancet. 2010 Sep;376(9744):874. " id="section-two_three">(3)</a>, no matter where. Therefore, it should  													be included as a research topic worldwide, and among global  													health researchers, in order to fully understand the relationship  													between corruption and health, and its determinants <a class="reference" href="#section-two_four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hanf M, Van-Melle A, Fraisse F, Roger A, Carme B, Nacher M. Corruption kills: estimating the global impact of corruption on children deaths. PLoS ONE. 2011;6(11):e26990. " id="section-two_4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key is to develop strong programmes and strategies  													created to address the characteristics of corruption in a country,  													and that will prevent problems within the health care system,  													in matters of access, inequity and outcomes (<a class="reference" href="#section-two_one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T.

					We highlight the misleading information given in the  													textbooks widely followed by the students of the West Bengal  													University of Health Sciences.

Syria: Public health achievements and the effect of sanctions. Indian J Med Ethics. 2012 Jul-Sep;9(3):151-3. " id="section-four_1">(1)</a>. In that  													report, the authors claim that economic sanctions imposed  													in 2011 were the reason behind the devaluation of the local  													currency, interruption of power supply, scarcity of medical  													supplies, and degradation of sanitation systems. Nowhere to  													be found in the report, however, is a description, albeit brief,  													of what those sanctions are and how they led to these effects.  													No evidence of cause and effect was presented, no suggested  													mechanisms, and most grave, no consideration for the interplay  													between sanctions and an all-out civil war situation that  													interrupted every sphere of economic activity in the country <a class="reference" href="#section-four_two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rovera D, Amnesty International.

Such biased and unscientific analysis flies moreover in the  													face of known facts about the Syrian economy. The political  													and economic isolation of the Syrian regime is not new, but  													has allowed Syria, in the past, to ward off most of the global  													economic crisis of 2008, and will certainly make it more resilient  													to economic sanctions per se <a class="reference" href="#section-four_three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Haddad B.

What is most disturbing in a  													report about the wellbeing of Syrians in the current conflict  													still is the lack of any reference to the role of the Syrian regime  													in inflicting death and hardship on its population. This role has  													been documented repeatedly by UN agencies, credible media  													outlets, and the international community, and was behind the  													mostly regime-targeting sanctions to begin with (<a class="reference" href="#section-four_two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rovera D, Amnesty International.

					Syria marks a unique case in modern history, where a war is  													waged by an armed-to-the-teeth regime against its own   people with 'all gloves off'. International treaties, norms, and moral  													constraints of conduct all cease to apply to how the Syrian  													regime is facing the uprising of people that is approaching   its  													two-year mark <a class="reference" href="#section-four_six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Editorial. A medical crisis in Syria. Lancet. 2012 Aug 11; 380(9841): 537. " id="section-four_6">(6)</a>. The wounded are followed to hospitals to be  													killed or kidnapped, the dead are mutilated and delivered to  													their families on the condition that they do not hold funerals,  													captives are tortured and summarily executed, and civilian areas  													are indiscriminately bombarded (<a class="reference" href="#section-four_two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rovera D, Amnesty International.

Furthermore, a distinct  													hallmark of the Syrian regime's crackdown on the uprising has  													been the targeting of healthcare facilities and workers.
