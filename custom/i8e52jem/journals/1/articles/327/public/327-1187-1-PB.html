				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee's approval of Bt brinjal, the first genetically modified crop for human consumption in India, has sparked off protests across the country. This article questions the so-called benefits of GM crops and highlights some major concerns. These include: inadequately addressed health and environmental risks, inadequate safety guidelines, a lack of transparency in sharing test data, the implications to seed sovereignty of farmers and the lack of informed choice for consumers. Some concerns about field testing by Mahyco, the developer of Bt-brinjal, and the process of evaluation by GEAC remain unresolved. With inadequate information about the crop's long-term safety, a precautionary approach is advocated before national policy allows commercial release of the seeds. A fair process is also needed in the public consultations being proposed by the minister of state for environment and forests. In addition to issues of procedural justice, a basic ethical question remains: do humans have a right to dominate the land and make expendable those creatures that they deem "undesirable"?

					On October 15, 2009, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) of the ministry of environment, the regulatory body for approving genetically modified crops (GM crops) in India, approved Bt brinjal, the first GM crop for human consumption in India, for commercial use <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Conservation and survey division, genetic engineering approval committee.

Available from: http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/experts/-panel-approves-bt-brinjal-final-okay-nowjairam/373318/!" id="2">2)</a>. The approval came following the review of reports submitted by the Maharashstra Hybrid Seeds Company Limited (Mahyco), the Indian subsidiary of the US-based company Monsanto, that uses biotechnology to produce high yielding, pest resistant crops. The Tamil Nadu Agriculture University and the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, were partners of Mahyco in the development of Bt brinjal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bt Brinjal is a genetically modified plant in which a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringensis is inserted into the genome of the brinjal, which can then produce a protein, Cry1Ac. This protein behaves as a toxin against the shoot and fruit borer (SFB), a pest that commonly affects brinjal. The gene modification also includes the addition of two antibiotic resistance marker genes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some media reports have been upbeat about the GEAC's approval <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Financial Express. FE Editorial: generally marvelous. The Financial Express [Internet].2009 Oct 16 [cited 2009 Nov 28].[about 3 screens].

Environmental and health concerns were cited that extend to other GM crops in the pipeline like GM tomatoes, GM potatoes, GM cabbage, etc. Doubts have been raised about the science used in the technology as well as the interpretation of biosafety tests. The GEAC's decision needs to be ratified by the minister of state for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, before it becomes policy. Mr Ramesh announced that a series of consultations with scientists, agricultural experts, farmers' organisations, consumer groups and non-governmental organisations would be held in January and February 2010 before a final decision is taken in March 2010 <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Domain-b.com.

It is unclear whether healthcare professionals will also have a voice in these consultations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethics of gene manipulations in the animal and human reproductive sciences, their clinical applications, and the impact on people's aspirations and life choices have been debated extensively by the healthcare professions. Genetic interventions in the food that we eat also affect our health, aspirations and life choices. As a healthcare professional concerned with bioethics, I decided to explore this controversy. Numerous and diverse issues emerged as I explored.

				<h4>Why GM foods?</h4>
				<p>
					GM foods have been projected as a solution to world hunger, crop failures and farmer suicides. GM foods are promoted with the claim that they increase yields and reduce pesticide use, which benefits farmers, consumers and the environment <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Hindu, Business Line. Machyco to give Bt brinjal tech to other seed cos. The Hindu[Internet]. 2009 Apr 14 [cited 2009 Nov 28].

				</p>
				<p>
					Indeed, many studies demonstrate that GM crops like Bt maize and Bt cotton produce higher yields <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Qaim M, Zilberman D. Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.

However, it has been argued that such claims are blown out of proportion as the Bt toxin is basically an insecticide, and insecticides cannot increase yields, only reduce losses. It has also been argued that farmers have shown equal or greater yields with high-yielding native (non-GM) seeds and a careful planning of the season and location for planting <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma Devinder.

GM crops cannot even claim to address world hunger, which is due not to a lack of food, but to the fact that the poor do not have buying power. Finally, US studies indicate that pesticide consumption is low only in the first three years, after which its use has actually increased by about 4.1% in farms with GE varieties <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Premnath V.

				<h4>What are the concerns about GM food?</h4>
				<P>
					A number of concerns regarding GM foods have been inadequately addressed: the risk that they pose to people's health and the environment, the inadequate guidelines for assessing safety, the lack of transparency in sharing data related to safety testing, the implications for farmers' seed sovereignty, and the lack of informed choice for consumers.

					The gene transfer in Bt brinjal involves two antibiotic resistance marker genes for resistance to Kanamycin and Streptomycin. These are important drugs among the very few that we have in our armamentarium against tuberculosis.

					The testing requirements for GM crops are more lax than those for drugs. Drug trials are conducted in five stages, with the first stage, known as pre-clinical studies, involving only animals.

Save a test that demonstrates that the toxin is undetectable within one minute of cooking, there are no other tests that demonstrate the safety of Bt brinjal for human consumption. It must be noted that Bt tomatoes and Bt cabbage (currently under development) would often be eaten raw. It is estimated that a kilogramme of Bt brinjal would contain 5-47 mg of the toxin, 100 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC95) for the pest larvae <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="EPA.

				<h4>Implications for farmers' seed sovereignty</h4>
				<p>
					Bt brinjal was developed by transforming the brinjal proprietary line of Mahyco, which will therefore own all Bt brinjal seeds.

Seeds for GM crops have to be bought from Mahyco and their franchisees, at the price set by them, which is a threat to the seed sovereignty of Indian farmers.

Since GM seeds will be released widely for agriculture, it is important to consider their effects on the integrity of complicated ecosystems and delicate biospheres. It may actually be impossible to reverse the changes that will occur in the environment.

					India is a party to the Convention of Biological diversity <a class="reference" href="#thirtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The convention on biological diversity. Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Convention on biological diversity [Internet]. 2009 Aug 11 [cited 2009 Dec 1]. Available from: http://www.cbd.int/convention/convention.shtml" id="33">(33)</a> and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Environments and Forests, Government. of India. Ratification of Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety by India. Ministry of environments and forests [Internet]. 2002 Sep 5 [2009 Dec 1]. Available from:www.envfor.nic.in/news/janmar03/cartagena.doc" id="34">(34)</a>. The Protocol is based on the Precautionary Principle which states that "When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically." The Protocol also states: "Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating a particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an acceptable risk;". The brinjal is an indigenous Indian crop with maximum genetic diversity. The Cartagena Protocol calls for extreme caution in introducing GM crops to countries which are the centres of origin for the non-GM varieties of those crops. In view of the seemingly irreconcilable concerns about the biosafety of Bt brinjal, would there not be justification to plead for a more precautionary approach?
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to concerns about safety, there is a basic ethical issue here. Do humans have a right to dominate the land and make creatures that they deem "undesirable" expendable? Is an industrial, commercial and profit-driven civilisation our goal?
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bt brinjal controversy has elicited a very polarised and emotional debate between those for and those against the technology. Jairam Ramesh has an important responsibility to ensure a fair process in the consultations, including issuing advertisements, making documents available to the public for commenting and holding hearings in an empowering spirit. Civil society organisations too have an important responsibility to participate actively in the consultations and ensure that India's policy on Bt brinjal encompasses economic concerns, environmental health, people's health and choices.
