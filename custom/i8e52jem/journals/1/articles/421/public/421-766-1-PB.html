			<h2>FILM REVIEW</h2>
			<h3>A jab at healthcare</h3>

				<h4>The barbarian invasions (Miramax, 2003). Director:
				Dennys Arcand</h4>
				<p>
					This movie has won an Academy Award. The director is a
					celebrated talent. The characters in the movie are from an
					earlier, feted oeuvre (The Decline of the American Empire, 1986).
					So when I sat down to review The barbarian invasions the
					daggers were drawn. A few minutes into the movie, however,
					all this has changed. In fluid tracking shots I am whooshed
					through a long line of beds with patients hooked to saline
					bottles and assorted beeping medical contraptions. It took a
					while for it to hit me. This is the corridor of the hospital where
					the rooms are literally overflowing with patients. And it is in
					Quebec in Canada, where according to Michael Moore's Sicko,
					you get the best medical care in the world! Clearly, director
					Denis Arcand has chosen shock therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here, Arcand tells the story of terminally ill Remy (Remy Girard)
					who seeks to make peace with the world he has lived in. So
					you see him pinned down in a hospital bed while his family
					and friends reach out for him in spite of the fact that he has
					had a rather self-serving existence until then. Remy has been
					an adulterer, a poor father and, by his own admission, had a
					lacklustre career. He is fortunate to find compassion in his
					support group.
				</p>
				<p>
					But not in the healthcare system. In scene after scene the
					director seeks to satirise the apathy inherent in a health care
					system that is creaking with overload. So you see amusing
					sequences like the Holy Communion going to the wrong
					patient, or a doctor comforting a patient without knowing his
					name or ailment. The scenes where the union-led workers are
					willing to do anything after a little greasing of the palms seem
					very similar to the malaise in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					In one sweeping statement the director declares that the
					system is sick. Forget cure, it is even unable to deliver a
					compassionate death. Which is why we see the family deciding
					the course of Remy's treatment much against medical advice.
					The son actually smuggles in cocaine to ease his father's pain.
				</p>
				<p>
					The characters uniformly suffer from verbal diarrhoea. The
					reminiscences reek of baby boomer yada-yada. The tales of
					sexual conquest drip with pre-AIDS syrupiness. But the film
					has huge merits. One has seen many flicks where individuals
					discontent with the system take the law into their own hands.
					This one has them commandeer medical treatment. While
					the major part of the film is about how Remy is eased into a
					peaceful death, what really linger are the jagged moments at
					the hospital. And, herein lies the true worth of this film. It forces
					you to ponder over the real state of healthcare. Can compassion
					ever be delivered on an assembly line? Can empathy be
					administered intravenously? Does the health bureaucracy have
					a heart? These indeed are the piercing questions.
