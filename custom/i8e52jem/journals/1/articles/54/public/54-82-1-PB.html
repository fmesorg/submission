				<p>
					There is little evidence on the quality of care patients receive  														in clinics in resource-poor settings. This study reports on the  														quality of primary care services in the public and private  														sectors in India, using about 926 clinical interventions between  														305 medical care providers and 22 unannounced standardised  														patients in rural and urban settings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study included 248 out of 256 possible patient-provider  														interactions from a convenience sample in urban Delhi  														collected in 2009, and 677 out of 738 possible interactions  														amongst selected providers who accounted for 80% of all  														healthcare visits from households in 60 villages in three  														districts of rural Madhya Pradesh collected in 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					The standardised patients were recruited from the local  														communities where the study was undertaken and trained  														for 150 hours to consistently portray the emotional, physical  														and psychosocial aspects of the cases and accurately recall  														interactions. They were coached to avoid invasive medical  														examinations in order to avoid any potential harm, and to  														retain the medicines dispensed to them. The standardised  														cases presented with three common clinical scenarios: unstable  														angina, asthma, or dysentery of a child (without the child's  														presence). Quality measures included adherence to defined" case-specific checklists" of essential and recommended care;  														the likelihood of correct diagnosis, and the appropriateness  														of treatment. Interactions were documented within one hour  														of the occurrence and medicines dispensed were saved and  														recorded whenever possible.
				</p>

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					In rural Madhya Pradesh, 11% of the providers had a   medical  														degree and 67 % had no medical training. In public sector  														clinics, 63% of the interactions were with providers   without  														a medical training. On an average, consultation time was  														3.6 minutes and one third of the essential questions and  														examinations were completed. In only 30.4% of times was   the  														correct treatment protocol followed. Also, 41.7% of the   time,  														unnecessary or harmful treatment was prescribed. Only 12%  														of providers could give a correct diagnosis. Among those   who  														provided a diagnosis, there is a direct relation seen   between completion of the checklist and giving a correct diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>Multiple linear regression analysis of three measures of quality &ndash; percentage of recommended questions and examinations, relative risk of giving any diagnosis and relative risk of giving correct treatment &ndash; showed that qualification of the provider, infrastructure, and the patient caseload had little significantassociation with any of the quality measures. In rural MadhyaPradesh, in private clinics, the mean checklist completionrates were 6.81% points higher than in public clinics; butwith respect to the other two quality measures there was no significant difference.</p>
				<p>
					In Delhi, 52% of private sector providers in the sample had  														a medical degree and all the public sector providers in the  														sample did. The average consultation time was 5.4 minutes in  														Delhi, and the rates of correct diagnosis (21.8%) and treatment  														(45.6%) were both higher than in Madhya Pradesh. But the  														essential checklist adherence in Delhi was 31.8% as against  														33.7% in Madhya Pradesh.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study concludes that training alone is not a sufficient  														arbiter of quality care. Both trained and untrained doctors were  														equally likely to<em> not</em> provide a diagnosis or correct treatment.  														(The paper also finds that "untrained providers in the private  														sector were more likely to adhere to checklists and were no  														worse in their treatment protocols than their public sector  														counterparts".)

				<h4>Comment</h4>
				<p>
					The paper discusses the very important aspect of quality of  														care within the existing healthcare delivery systems in rural  														Madhya Pradesh and urban Delhi. It has used the standardised  														patient as the means of obtaining data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethical dilemmas associated with the method, namely  														mystery/simulated patients, have been documented elsewhere <a class="reference" href="#one" "data-placement"="top" "data-trigger"="hover" rel="tooltip" title="van den Borne F. Using mystery clients to assess condom negotiation in Malawi: some ethical concerns, Stud Fam Plann. 2007 Dec; 38(4):322-30." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" "data-placement"="top" "data-trigger"="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Horvat N, Koder M, Kos M. Using the simulated patient methodology to assess paracetamol-related counselling for headache. PLoS One. 2012; 7(12): e52510.doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052510." id="2">2)</a>. However, the authors have failed to mention these  														potential dilemmas in the paper, thereby leaving it unclear as to  														what the methodological necessities were which outweighed  														the ethical dilemmas involved in the use of mystery/simulated  														patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					The paper,s key finding is that adherence to checklists   and  														providing diagnosis and accurate treatment are not shaped  														by the training received and there is reason to believe   that  														untrained private sector providers were more likely to   adhere  														to checklists. It is possible that the protocols that   facilitated effective training of standardised patients were the   training  														materials used by various providers to educate themselves;  														alternatively, the finding is an artefact of the training   given to  														the standardised patients. If they were trained to note   certain  														actions to be performed by the providers, they would. As  														they were not blinded to the qualifications of the   providers  														they would note them more for those non-qualified. But any  														additional actions undertaken by the provider would not   have  														been noticed or reported.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Exhibits 4 (p2780) and 5 (p2781) of the paper, the authors  														have represented the marginal effects of three regression  														analyses of which the first regression depicts possibly the  														unstandardised regression coefficients. These unstandardised  														regression equations cannot be compared across the  														same model and they cannot be used as a marker of their  														magnitude of relevance. For this, one uses the standardised  														regression coefficient. Either this should have been clarified  														or such depictions" that give a false impression that private  														sector provisioning is more important than qualification or  														facilities and equipment" should have been avoided. Such a  														representation is erroneous and misleading.
				</p>
				<p>
					As two-thirds of the scenarios involve chronic conditions, the  														study results may not be generalisable for communicable  														diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors recommend reforms in the way medical degrees  														are awarded, in addition to better payment mechanisms and   monitoring and denser peer network, the last possibly referring to more   interactions, formal and informal, across  														providers in an area which will serve as a check on   improper  														or ill advised medical practice. This conclusion is valid   only if  														we know why the current set of observed providers did what  														they did. For this reason, it would not be prudent to use   this  														study for generalisations about the determinants of   quality of  														medical care in India.
