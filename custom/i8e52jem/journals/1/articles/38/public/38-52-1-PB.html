				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have ethical implications. These
					include assessment of the risk-benefit ratio and re-administering
					informed consent based on the new ADRs identified. The Indian
					Council of Medical Research ethical guidelines mandate the
					scrutiny of ADR; and the standard operating procedures of the
					ethics committee of the authors' medical school endorse this line.
					However, institutional review board members are often hardpressed
					for time and are unable to analyse all the reported ADRs
					as thoroughly as required. This calls for a dedicated system for
					the scrutiny of ADRs. This paper seeks to share the experience of
					development and implementation of a review mechanism for ADR
					monitoring.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors report an innovation in ADR monitoring by
					appointing a technical advisor on ADR (TA-ADR). During routine
					assessment, an unusual occurrence of ADRs was noticed from
					internal and external sites which were related to the study drug,
					which in turn resulted in the trial being put on hold. This system is
					being reported here for possible adoption by others.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					An essential part of the agreed mandate of all human ethics
					committees is the protection of the human participants.
					According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
					guidelines, "an adverse event (AE) or an unexpected adverse
					drug reaction (ADR) requires expedited review by the ethics
					committee" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human participants [Internet]. New Delhi: ICMR; 2006 Oct[cited 2013 Jul 4]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/ethical_ guidelines.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. ADR monitoring during clinical trials involving
					investigational new drugs (INDs) plays a critical role in ensuring
					the safety of participants. In addition, safety monitoring by the ethics committee is important for making an ongoing
					estimate of risk-benefit, and hence has a bearing on ethical
					dimensions of the trial as well. If the risk-benefit ratio is found
					unfavourable, reassessment needs to be done based on the
					four moral principles of justice, autonomy, beneficence, and
					non-maleficence and re-administering of informed consent by
					informing research participants about potential ADRs based
					on the new problems identified. In spite of this overarching
					importance of ADRs and safety monitoring, this activity
					does not receive sufficiently thorough and comprehensive
					attention and review. One of the major reasons for this is
					the fact that members of the ethics committee have dual
					affiliations, one with their respective primary departments and
					the other with the ethics committee. AWHO document titled
					Pharmacovigilance in drug regulation observes that routine
					review of safety information requires considerable resources,
					expertise, support and commitment from those involved <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.

					Too much and uncritical reliance on data safety monitoring
					boards also dilutes the attention that ADRs deserve.

Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/ethical_ guidelines.pdf" id="1">(1)</a> and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the
					Institutional Human Ethics Committee (IHEC) of the authors'
					medical school mandate the scrutiny of ADRs.
				</P>
				<P>
					Against this background, the Institutional Review Board
					(IRB) conducted a review of the Committee's structure and
					functions. The report on the review exercise recommended
					that a technical advisor (TA) on ADR monitoring (TA-ADR) be appointed by the IHEC to exclusively scrutinise ADRs.
					The suggestion was accepted by the IHEC and the head of
					the institution. The office of the TA on ADR monitoring is an
					office of non-profit, like that of the chairperson and membersecretary
					of the IHEC.
				</P>
				<p>
					A pharmacologist trained in pharmacovigilance took over
					as technical advisor to the IHEC on adverse drug reactions
					(TA-ADR) in the authors' institution in February 2010. He was
					not a member of the IHEC. He had signed a confidentiality
					agreement with the IHEC and was invited to its full board
					review meetings to report and offer clarifications on ADRs.
					We believed that it would have been more appropriate to
					have given this task to a pharmacologist, because not only
					would his/her task in the ethics committee be well-defined
					and focused only on adverse reactions and events, but his/her
					specialisation in pharmacology would give him/her the subject
					expertise to explore the adverse events and their causation
					based on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and other
					mechanistic points of view. IRB members are very busy going
					through the study protocols assigned to them and cannot give
					their full time to IRB work, due to the pressing schedule in their
					home departments. Therefore, we appointed a pharmacologist
					with a year's experience in pharmacovigilance as a TA-ADR.
				</p>
				<p>
					We give below one of our experiences to highlight how this
					practice was useful.
				</p>
				<p>
					The TA-ADR starts conducting close scrutiny of ADRs received
					periodically by the IHEC and prepares periodic reports. All the
					ADRs are entered into the computer according to the clinical
					study. The WHO causality assessment scale is being followed
					for assessing the ADRs <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre. The use of WHO-UMC system for standardized case causality assessment [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; [cited 2013 Jul 4]. Available from: http://who-umc.org/ Graphics/24734.pdf" id="6">(6)</a>. The reports are then periodically
					submitted to the ethics committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					During routine assessment, an unusual occurrence of ADRs
					was noticed in a particular phase III clinical trial (Study X) of
					drug XYZ (names changed to maintain anonymity) for which
					approval was granted in June 2009. The Study X file had ADRs
					reported from the institution's site apart from the external sites.
					In April 2010, seven cases of osteonecrosis of a specific region
					(name withheld to maintain anonymity) were reported from
					the external sites by the sponsor of this study. According to the
					investigators, five cases were possibly related to the study drug
					XYZ and two were not. Apart from these reports, one report
					each of ischaemic colitis, ischaemic stroke and coronary artery
					disease were also received for drug XYZ. A thorough search of
					the literature was done and it was found that the study drug
					XYZ could inhibit an important biological molecule; this action
					could mechanistically explain the serious side-effects that had
					occurred.
				</p>
				<p>
					After analysing the ADRs in detail, the TA-ADR came to a
					conclusion that though the co-morbid conditions of the
					patients could have contributed to these events, considering
					the long half-life (21 days) of drug XYZ and the protective role
					of the important biological molecule (which is blocked by
					drug XYZ), the possible role of the suspect drug could not be
					excluded. The TA-ADR observed that the use of drug XYZ could
					result in serious side-effects. The PI of the study was informed about this concern. The TA-ADRs informed the IRB during its
					full board meeting about the danger of continuing the study
					drug. After a thorough discussion, the IRB members came to
					the conclusion that safety of the patients participating in the
					particular study was at risk. All the members agreed on this
					point and this decision was minuted by the IRB. The minutes
					were sent to all the IRB members for their final approval and it
					was decided by the IRB to withhold the study. In May 2010, the
					IHEC decided to withhold the study till the safety of the drug
					XYZ was fully established. The PI, on the invitation of the IHEC,
					explained the matter before the full board review meeting of
					the IHEC. A few weeks later, in June 2010, the PI approached the
					principal of the institution with a letter from the sponsor of the
					trial with an accompanying communication from the United
					States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) to put the trial
					on hold, which corroborated the IHEC's decision to withhold
					the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					This experience with an exclusive TA-ADR underlines the need
					for the same. We have now decided to strengthen the office of
					the TA-ADR by introducing more innovations such as assigning
					a colour code to the sheets in which ADRs are printed, based
					on the seriousness criteria.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other lessons learned include: (i) The importance of
					conducting periodic reviews by the IHEC to identify areas of
					strength and weakness, ways and means to strengthen the
					system further, as also to strengthen the SOP; and (ii) assign
					specific roles for each of the members, eg, we have designated
					one member of the IHEC as "Member in charge of protocol
					amendments" (this system has since been replaced with that of
					the "Primary reviewer" of each protocol prospectively following
					it (all aspects including amendments) up until the closure
					of the study) and another member as "Member in charge of
					stored tissues".
				</p>
				<p>
					We report this with a view to share this experience with others.
