			<h2>OBITUARY</h2>
			<h3>Dr Wishvas Rane (1930-2008)</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Ananth Phadke</h4>

				<p>
					The passing away of Wishvas Rane or Bapu brought back
					memories of the various initiatives in which we were involved
					together since the late 1970s, and his mature, honest, rational
					approach from which we learnt so much. I got acquainted
					with Bapu in the late '70s when the Aarogya Dakshata Mandal,
					a Pune-based health NGO led by Arvind Patwardhan and
					Dr Rane, launched a pictorial health education periodical in
					Marathi called Silver Oak. This pioneering periodical was aimed
					at the neo-literate population, but was widely read by a much
					larger section of people because the contents were relevant,
					practical, to the point and scientifically sound.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aarogya Dakshata Mandal, due to the enthusiastic leadership
					of Dr Patwardhan, also launched the Pune Journal of Continuing
					Education, a monthly devoted to the continuing medical
					education of doctors on rational therapeutics. The Pune Journal,
					edited by Dr Rane, contained only four pages of matter printed
					in tabloid format on newsprint and the annual subscription in
					the early '80s was a mere Rs 15 (including postage!). It was not
					supported by any funding agency or government programme
					and did not accept advertisements from pharmaceutical
					companies, and Dr Rane's inputs were voluntary. However, it
					quickly acquired a reputation for its short, high quality, practical
					pieces with critical information on various standard medical
					therapies as well as on the irrational and hazardous medicines
					being widely used by doctors in those days.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among these irrational medicines were Analgin (the obsolete
					analgesic and anti-pyretic widely used by almost every
					general practitioner and also by consultants) and fixed dose
					combinations of high dose oestrogen and progesterone.
					Dr Rane also wrote on the irrational use and overuse of
					phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone; about anabolic
					steroids and about a whole range of irrational fixed dose
					combinations. This information was based on standard
					textbooks of pharmacology and on other medical textbooks
					such as the Physicians' Desk Reference, the British National
					Formulary, and WHO and UNO publications. In the early '80s,
					such information was mostly unknown not only to general
					practitioners but even to many consultants. (We did not then
					have Dr Chandra Gulhati writing his incisive pieces in MIMS, and
					Drug Disease Doctor and BODHI were yet to be born.) The Pune
					Journal was an antidote to the propaganda of pharmaceutical
					companies. It quickly became the talk of the town and
					continued for almost a decade against all odds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Rane also played an active role in the All India Drug Action
					Network (AIDAN) from its inception. The seeds of AIDAN were
					sown when activists from various backgrounds and regionscame together for a low cost, all-India workshop convened in
					Pune by Aarogya Dakshata Mandal on rational therapeutics.
					We chalked out a programme of action against the continued
					marketing of irrational/hazardous medicines.
				</p>
				<p>
					By training, Dr Rane was a statistician and then an Ayurvedic
					graduate. However, because of certain developments in
					the family he had to get involved in the family business of
					managing the marketing of pharmaceutical products of
					Unichem Pharma whose owner had links with the freedom
					struggle and who was struggling against the domination
					of multinational corporations. In the process of teaching
					medical representatives working under him, Dr Rane studied
					various aspects of allopathic pharmacology and became more
					knowledgeable about it than most allopathic graduates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unichem used to market the oestrogen and progesterone
					combination EP Forte. Dr Rane was campaigning with us
					against this obsolete drug, because of which ultimately it was
					banned. He left the work of Unichem to be with this campaign.
					Within AIDAN Dr Rane, the senior-most amongst us activists,
					played an important, sobering role. Some of us were too fired
					up because of our ideologies and Dr Rane forced us to come
					up with hardcore scientific evidence to justify our arguments.
					In other ways also, his commitment, his straightforward, frank
					and mature personality helped to stabilise AIDAN. To those
					who were somewhat closer to him, he offered his advice about
					our personal problems in the spirit of an elder brother.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of his main contributions to the Indian drug action
					movement was his central involvement in collaborating with
					Mira Shiva for the preparation of the booklet Banned and
					bannable drugs, published by the Voluntary Health Association
					of India. This book lists the major brands of banned drugs in
					India, along with the rationale for banning them. It also lists a
					range of irrational, hazardous drugs that AIDAN wanted to be
					banned. This book had several revised editions and Dr Rane
					continued to give detailed inputs for all these editions despite
					his advancing age. The book was reproduced in a special issue
					of The Illustrated Weekly of India to reach millions of people in
					India. Later, The Hindu carried a series on irrational, hazardous
					drugs and this series had a much wider readership.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Rane painstakingly documented the rise in prices of different
					categories of medicines by comparing, every few years, the
					retail prices of hundreds of medicines as given in relevant
					editions of MIMS. These analyses were published periodically in <em>The Economic and Political Weekly</em> and were widely appreciated.They remain the only such series of studies on the movement
					of prices of important categories of medicines in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Rane not only participated in the campaign for the use of
					rational medicines and for the use of generic names, he also
					ventured to start a co-operative factory to manufacture generic
					formulations in the Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra. Ratnagiri
					Drugs Private Limited was inaugurated by Zafrullah Choudhary
					and hailed by many well-wishers but the experiment failed;
					the expected orders from local governmental hospitals did not
					come through as Dr Rane was not willing to compromise on his
					principles. He suffered huge losses but did not depart from his
					convictions on the use of rational, essential medicines under
					their generic names. Ratnagiri Drugs was the harbinger of the
					successful LOCOST experiment launched later by a collective.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pioneering was part of Dr Rane's nature. This continued till his
					death, albeit in a poignant way, in his approach to dealing with
					his advanced cancer of colon. He did undergo surgery and
					chemotherapy. But when he realised that further therapy would
					be of questionable value, he decided to stop all treatment
					and face his approaching death squarely. He told himself that
					cancer was his long-term associate (he had prostatic cancer for
					more than five years) and it would not trouble him. He said that
					death was inevitable for every living being; it's just that he was
					dying due to cancer. He remained calm and waited for nature
					to take its course. Perhaps due to this attitude he survived for
					two years after stopping all chemotherapy, when doctors had
					predicted that he would not survive for more than two to four
					months. These last two years were virtually free of troublesome
					symptoms. During the last months of his life he wrote a book
					in Marathi about his encounter with cancer and its treatment.
					There have been books in Marathi by cancer survivors who
					share their inspiring stories of overcoming cancer. Dr Rane,
					in his late 70s, describes his philosophy of facing death with
					equanimity, as a natural phenomenon. In his characteristic
					Bapu style -- frank, somewhat detached and matter of fact -- he
					also shares the experience of various "medical mishaps" during
					his treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bapu will continue to inspire us, especially when we are faced
					with a challenge to launch a pioneering effort.
