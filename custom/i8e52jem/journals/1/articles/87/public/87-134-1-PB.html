				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Bioethics is a relatively new way of thinking about  relationships in medical practice. It enables reflection on ethical  conflicts, and opens up management options without dictating rules.  Despite this historical context, medical ethics has been sidelined in  the course of the development of bioethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bioethical reflection does not automatically result in changes  to conflict resolution in daily doctor-patient relationships. However,  these reflections are important because they promote the search for a  "moral consensus" that establishes new ethical rules for day-to-day  medical practice. We suggest that there is no conflict between bioethics  and medical ethics; rather, these areas interact to establish new  standards of behaviour among physicians. The legalisation of  orthothanasia in Brazil is one example of how this theory of moral  consensus might operate. On the other hand, the legal battle on abortion  illustrates how the law cannot change without such a moral consensus.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Bioethics has received tremendous impetus as a fresh and  non-traditional assessment of ethics in medicine since the 1970s. It is  primarily viewed as the humanistic exercise of reflecting on the natural  conflicts of a profession in which two parties, originally the doctor  and the patient, attempt to relate in a complex manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bioethics is a new discipline that aims to combine biology and  human values, "but it has gradually shifted its attention away from the  medical field and biological technology" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Belkin GS. History and bioethics: the uses of Thomas Percival. Med Humanit Rev. 1998 Fall;12(2):39-59." id="1">(1)</a>. The moral codes of the  medical profession were relegated to the sidelines. Many bioethicists  believed that the professional codes were no more than rulebooks listing  duties to be strictly fulfilled without the power to stimulate thinking  in those who fulfil these duties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some view these moral codes as merely inelegant, but others view  them as obsolete and even hypocritical <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="TannsjoT. Moral dimensions. BMJ. 2005 Sep 24;331(7518):689-91" id="1">(2)</a>. The latter perspective  suggests that the codes of medical ethics, which originated from the  Hippocratic Oath and the code of the British physician Thomas Percival <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Percival T. Medical ethics or a code of institutes and precepts. Adapted to the professional conduct of physicians and surgeons. Manchester: J Johnson and R. Bickerstaff; 1803." id="3">(3)</a>, have no place in a globalised society with many conflict-provoking  situations and moral issues. Therefore, while bioethics, which espouses a  novel assessment of relationships and ethical conflicts, would open a  range of management options without dictating rules of behaviour,  bioethical reflection does not always modify the general practice of  conflict resolution in daily doctor-patient relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					This dichotomy is erroneous. Ethics since Aristotle has been  characterised by reflection on our own conflicts and values regarding  appropriate human conduct. Such reflection is inevitably connected to  the morals of a society. Conversely, morals and codes of conduct act as  practical translations of this ethical reflection and represent the  values of a particular social <em>corpus</em><a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Konold D. Codes of medical ethics: history. In: Reich WT, editor. Encyclopedia of Bioethics. New York: The Free Press; A Division of McMillan Publishing Co Inc; 1978:162-70." id="4">(4)</a>.
			</p></div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Moral consensus</h4>
				<p>
					This "social practice" does not occur randomly. Social and  professional groups inevitably disagree on the correctness of certain  moral stands. These differences are dependent on subjective values,  religious or political concepts and individual views. A discussion of  these ideas, views and values is necessary to arrive at a minimum  consensus (the term "consensus" is used here to reflect the majority  view within a particular social and / or professional group) among the  various parties involved, either within a social group or a group within  different professions, and to establish standards and codes of conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, in strict sociological terms, the establishment of  moral rules and sets of duties that include all members of a particular  social group is similar to a game in which the winners are the majority  of supporters of a particular rule or principle.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, various codes of professional ethics ban sex with  patients. This rule would have been preceded by ethical reflection of  the conflicts that could arise when a doctor falls in love with or  desires his or her patient. This standard would have been adopted,  implemented and respected by all physicians only after the attainment of  a minimum moral consensus that sexual involvement would be detrimental  to the doctor-patient relationship.
				</p>
				<p>
					The situation outlined above is intentionally simplistic, but this  dynamic has the potential to occur in several areas of medical  practice. Generally, "winning" groups within a community assert their  values and arrive at a "moral consensus" on the part of the losers, who  must accept and comply with the imposed rules.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The crisis of ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Moral and ethical codes are often imposed on individuals in the  form of rules and duties, but these codes arise from a consensus that  reflects the majority values within a particular social and / or  professional group. One can argue that this social or professional group  consensus can be achieved through the use of force. But we are talking  about the "consensus" obtained through the democratic debate of ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both the philosophical reflection on ethical problems that plague  certain social groups and the establishment of moral codes that emerge  from these discussions through consensus appear at times of historical  crisis. The crisis could be in the given society or within the medical  profession itself. Hippocrates coined his oath when a growing distrust  of doctors occurred in Greek society. His set of rules was aimed at  reassuring the public that health professionals were committed to  assisting their patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					To illustrate this point, we borrow the concept of the "paradigm  crisis" of Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kuhn TS. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; 1970." id="5">(5)</a> According to Kuhn,  theories and explanations that are used to explain natural phenomena are  considered paradigmatic until the moment that they no longer satisfy  the scientific community.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this time, Kuhn states, criticisms of the prevailing  theoretical model begin either because the pre- existing theory is  insufficient to explain all of the variations of the same phenomenon, or  because it does not explain some apparent anomalies of the previously  studied phenomena.
				</p>
				<p>
					This situation creates an environment for the development of a new  theoretical model, a new paradigm that can better explain both the  variants and anomalies of the phenomenon in question.
				</p>
				<p>
					The notion of crisis can be implemented for ethical reflection in  medicine. In general, these crises are represented by changes in  technology and social values, which lead to the emergence of conflicts  in the daily practice of physicians and their relationships with their  patients. In these times of transformation, moral codes, and therefore  ethics, may be temporarily unhelpful in ethical conflict resolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, reflections on these new conflicts must be conducted to  ensure that the existing codes are adequate for the new social reality.  The professional group can propose a different ethical approach that is  better adapted to the new technological and / or social conditions. In a  specific social context in times of crisis, society "shakes" ethicists  into a deeper reflection on new values and behavioural changes. These  situations are ripe for bioethics debates.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The ethics of daily life</h4>
				<p>
					Crises in human medicine are numerous and demand ethicists'  increasing reflection on various topics. These demands can be  effectively translated into questions, such as, "What should I do?"  "What can I do?" and "What can't I do?" Such questions are heard when  new inventions are introduced in the biomedical field, and often these  questions are followed by a new statement: "This is not in the Code of  Ethics!"
				</p>
				<p>
					At first, these issues are brought to institutional ethics or  bioethics committees, and individual cases are resolved without  generalisation of conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, professionals desire generalisation, and wish for a guide  to the "ethics of daily life" that will assist in the resolution of  pressing yet basic questions. They look for guidelines that are more  stable, more direct and more objective than the partial resolutions of  ethics or bioethics committees.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution we expect adjusts the nature of professional conduct  by the insertion of new standards into their professional codes. These  standards can be carried in the professionals' "pocket memory" to ensure  that their use is more commonplace.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Dynamic ethics and ethical paradigms</h4>
				<p>
					Snyder and Leffler of the Ethics and Human Rights Committee at the  American College of Physicians state, "Medicine, law and social values  are not static. Reexamining the ethical tenets of medical practice and  its application in new circumstances is a necessary exercise." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Snyder L, Leffler C. Ethics and Human Rights Committee, American College of Physicians. Ethics manual. Ann Intern Med. 2005 Apr 5;142(7):560-82." id="6">(6)</a> Therefore, after a certain period of maturation, a dynamic philosophical  analysis of ethical dilemmas in the most diverse corners of empirical  observation generates (or does not generate) a new moral consensus  within a social group. These periods of intense reflection create a  moral consensus that the old code and ethics must be renewed to adapt to  the new social reality.
				</p>
				<p>
					A good example is the shift in what Thomas Kuhn describes as "the  ethical paradigm" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kuhn TS. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; 1970." id="5">(5)</a> of the paternalistic relationship between doctors  and patients to a new standard of respect for the principle of autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					This transition from paternalism to respect for patient autonomy  occurred only after a period of crisis in which patients were better  informed by greater access to scientific information, and questioned  medical conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical paternalism thwarted the efforts, by those interested in  medical ethics, to reflect on the relationships of doctors and patients  until a new moral consensus was reached, and respect for patient  autonomy was integrated into the new codes of medical ethics. In other  words, the principle of autonomy was "conquered" by patients and not  "granted" by doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, ethical codes are unchanged when a moral consensus is not  reached within a social group. The issue of abortion on demand is a  classic example. Although the prohibition on pregnancy termination  challenges the principle of autonomy for women, a consensus on the issue  has not been attained in many societies, including Catholic countries  like Brazil</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Building moral consensus around orthothanasia</h4>
				<p>
					The issue of orthothanasia is an example of moral consensus in  Brazil. The practice was banned by law and the Code of Medical Ethics  for many years.  In 2007, the Federal Council of Medicine tried to issue  a resolution, in the form of an addendum to the Code of Medical Ethics,  permitting orthothanasia, or the withdrawal of care in a terminal  illness to permit a "passive death". The federal prosecutor's office  filed a representation before the Supreme Court to block the resolution.  The judges initially ruled in favour of the prosecutors.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, there was an extensive public debate, with several  meetings between prosecutors and doctors, joint seminars on the subject,  and demonstration (through media surveys) that public opinion was  favourable to orthothanasia. Eventually a consensus was reached, and in  2009, the Code of Medical Ethics was amended to include a chapter on  Fundamental Principles. Article XXII states: "In the irreversible and  terminal medical conditions, your doctor will avoid the performance of  unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and allow the patients  under their care all appropriate palliative care." <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine. Code of Medical Ethics. Brasilia :Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine. 2009 Sep 17; p22." id="7">(7).</a> This  modification established orthothanasia as appropriate in medical  practice; it is now accepted by Brazilian society.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Building the moral consensus around abortion</h4>
				<p>
					In the case of abortion, however, pressure from religious groups  prevented any such change.  Most of the population of Brazil is  Catholic, follows the religion's precepts and does not accept the  practice of abortion. The law permits abortion only when the mother's  life is threatened by the pregnancy, or when pregnancy results from  rape.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, starting in 2004, a battle on this subject involved all  of Brazilian society, through the media as well as the professional  associations and religious groups, and the issue of abortion of  anencephalic foetuses entered the agenda of the Supreme Court where it  was finally decided upon in 2012.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opponents of abortion argued that legalising the abortion of an  anencephalic foetus would open the door for the legalisation of abortion  for other reasons. Further, in their view, the anencephalic foetus is a  living human being. On the other hand, groups supporting the right to  abortion argued against the notion that a woman should be required to  bring, to the end of gestation, a foetus that would not survive outside  the womb. They also argued that, in Brazil, the definition of death  hinges on brain death, and an anencephalic foetus was not a living being  since it has no brain.
				</p>
				<p>
					On April 12, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled to permit abortion when  there is foetal anencephaly <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Human Rights Watch. Brazil: Supreme Court Abortion Ruling a Positive Step. Hrw.org. [Internet]. 2012 Apr 19[cited 2013 Jan 16]. Available from: http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/04/19/brazil-supreme-court-abortion-ruling-positive-step" id="8">(8)</a>.  This was in a case filed by the  National Trade Union of Health Workers supported by the Institute of  Bioethics, Human Rights, and Gender. From this date, the conditions for  performing legal abortions in Brazil are: a) when the pregnancy is  life-threatening to the pregnant woman, and abortion is the only way to  save the mother's life; b) when the pregnancy results from rape; and c)  when the woman is pregnant with an anencephalic foetus, as it is  specified in the Brazilian Penal Code.
				</p>
				<p>
					However religious groups in Brazil continue to oppose abortion  even when there is foetal anencephaly, and there is no moral consensus  in the country on what is now a legal practice. Thus, despite this small  advance, abortion remains illegal except in specific situations.  In  our opinion, there is a long way to go until it reaches a minimum moral  consensus on this matter.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Building our own ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Ethics and bioethics do not exist separately; one feeds the other  to encourage mutual advancement. Ethical reflection is empty without its  counterpart in praxis. This sequence seems obvious, but this has not  occurred in various parts of the world. According to the deontological  approach based on Kant's moral philosophy, ethics is a matter of "doing  the right thing". This is expressed in the form of codes for physicians  in daily practice. This approach has been criticised on the ground that  it "cannot be used to explicate all the moral requirements in  biomedicine."<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beauchamp TL, Childress JF. Principles of biomedical ethics. 5th ed. New" id="1">(9)</a> Another criticism is stated by Gillon: "Kant's moral  philosophy is rejected by some philosophers as offering far too austere,  even arid, a version of morality in that it seems to have no central  place for any moral obligation of beneficence, such as a positive duty  to love others or at least to help them. A further criticism is of  Kant's absolutism, for Kant was unequivocal that the supreme moral law  applied categorically, without exception." <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Gillon R. Philosophical Medical Ethics. New York: Wiley Medical Publications; 1991:16-17." id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this group of philosophers forgets that professionals who  follow the rules may not possess the time, interest or willingness to  reflect on these rules themselves. Many physicians do not want to be  (bio)ethicists or moral philosophers. Many physicians are willing to  behave in an honourable and honest manner, treat their patients with  care and follow the moral principles of the society in which they live. A  code of conduct provides them with a manual of rules that must be  strictly followed.
				</p>
				<p>
					In most cases, this is enough: the doctor provides the correct  diagnosis and treatment, and the patient gets better.  But what if  things are not so simple? The cases of abortion for anencephaly and  orthothanasia in Brazil are examples of such situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such unforeseen ethical and moral dilemmas require a more  sophisticated reflection that in turn requires the participation of the  whole social body and not just a group of doctors. This is especially so  in an extremely unequal society like Brazil. Only on achieving a moral  consensus among all parties involved can we change codes of ethics and  also cause them to be followed.
				</p>
				<p>
					For some time now, Brazilian society has demanded the adoption of  orthothanasia, and the right of a pregnant woman to abort an  anencephalic foetus. However, only with the revised Code of Ethics ??was  the first principle stated explicitly in the code in 2009. The  legalisation of abortion of anencephalic foetuses still waits for a new  revision of the code, although it is already provided for in the  criminal justice system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Codes of ethics can provide simple rules of good practice. On the  other hand, these codes also call for doctors to evolve their own ethics  based on "clean living" and a desire to treat their patients well.  These are voluntary actions and a "public trust", in Percival's words <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Percival T. Medical ethics or a code of institutes and precepts. Adapted to the professional conduct of physicians and surgeons. Manchester: J Johnson and R. Bickerstaff; 1803." id="3">(3)</a>. However, it is easier to do what the rule imposed by the code  requires without having to think about each particular rule: How and why  does this rule exist? What is its moral value? The physician often  walks a long hard road to build his or her own ethics, which the French  philosopher Michel Foucault calls a "subjective construction" of  self-awareness, to improve his own being and reach his destination as  "the one person he would be." <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Foucault M. [The hermeneutics of the subject]. Paris: Editions du Seuil, 2001. French." id="11">(11)</a>.  In other words, doctors have to  obtain a full understanding of their person and their profession and  seek to develop their human rationality and social ethics, and not act  mechanically from rulebooks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pellegrino wrote: "Medicine is, therefore, a moral enterprise in  two senses: first, in that its central and most characteristic function  focuses on a right decision which is good for a patient; second, it  explicitly codifies the values which should guide the good physician's  decisions. But these considerations do not automatically make medicine  an ethical enterprise, even though these codes are often called codes of  ethics, and a physician who follows them is considered an ethical  physician. To be ethical is not synonymous with following a code of  moral principles. Ethics comes into existence, properly speaking, when  morality itself becomes problematic, when the validity of beliefs about  what is right and good comes into question or when a conflict between  opposing moral systems or obligations must be resolved."<a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pellegrino ED. Ethics and the moral center of the medical enterprise. Bull NY Acad Med. 1978 Jul-Aug; 54(7):625-40." id="12">(12)</a>. When  morality itself becomes problematic, when conflicts opposing moral  systems and values ??emerge, only a moral consensus between the parties  involved, after deep bioethical reflection can solve the problem.</p>
