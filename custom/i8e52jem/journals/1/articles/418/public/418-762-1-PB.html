			<h3>Social and ethical basis of legislation on surrogacy: need for debate</h3>
			<h4 class="auhtor">Imrana Qadeer</h4>
			<hr>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					As a public health priority assisted  reproductive technologies
					(ARTs) are low on the epidemiological  scale in India. Of
					the estimated 8-10% infertility in  Indian women 98% have
					secondary sterility-they have been  pregnant at least once
					before but are unable to conceive  again. Their problems
					are due to untreated disease, poor  health care practices or
					malnutrition. Most of these can be  avoided through effective
					antenatal and postnatal care, and  through good primary health
					care with basic facilities to diagnose  and treat infertility. All this
					can be done without distorting public  health priorities.</p>
				<p>
					However, such services are not  available to the majority of
					people in India. And women who are  unable to have children
					face suffering and social ostracisation.  Further, the desire for
					children is laced with the eugenic  notion of genetic belonging
					in patriarchal societies. These  conditions are used by the
					medical profession and medical market  to promote ARTs.
				</p>
				<p>
					ARTs are also used for surrogacy. In  this case, an embryo is
					created with in vitro fertilisation  (IVF) and implanted in the uterus
					of a "surrogate mother". (The sperm  and ova used for IVF come
					from donors or the commissioning  couple. Ova are "harvested"  surgically following the  administration of drugs.) The surrogate
					carries the pregnancy to term and  hands over the baby to the
					couple or individual who has  commissioned the pregnancy. She
					is paid a fee for carrying the  pregnancy. Surrogates are almost
					always from poor and lower middle  class backgrounds <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sarojini N B, Astha, Preeti, Anjali, Deepa.Commercialisation of surrogacy in the Indian context. Medico Friends Circle Bull 2008 Aug-Sep; 330: 5-7." id="1">(1)</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Surrogacy is becoming more common in  India though it is the
					only option in just a fraction of IVF  cases. One factor in this rise
					is reproductive tourism as people  travel to India to commission
					a baby. Another is the economic  compulsions of the not so well
					off. A third is the growing tribe of  experts within the medical
					market who see profits in this  procedure. The three factors
					have pushed surrogacy with ART beyond  its legitimate place in
					priorities. They have allowed the  medical profession to exploit
					the economically needy.</p>
				<p>
					Every technology has a bias depending  upon the context
					in which it evolves. However, its  impact outside that context
					depends upon the manner in which it is  used. It can be used to
					nurture traditional values and curtail  the potential to create new
					ethical practices. Or it can be used  to question existing retrograde
					practices and values. How do social  forces shape the use of ARTs
					and their progressive potentials if  any? To answer this we explore
					the way these technologies are used  and their social impact.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Social processes and  the introduction of ART and surrogacy</h4>
				<p>
					When a society changes rapidly, its  ethical norms are
					challenged. They are challenged by the  biases of new knowledge and by the conflicts created  as new practices
					threaten these norms.</p>
				<p>
					Ethics is the notion of what is good  and right in society
					that guides human action. In periods  of transition new
					understandings emerge of what is  ethical practice.
					This emergence is not a linear process  but a trajectory
					interspersed with conflicts of ideas  and interests in various
					arenas of the technology-society  interface. In medicine, for
					example, the principles of  beneficence, non maleficence,
					consent, confidentiality and patient  autonomy have guided
					clinical practice. The discipline of  public health added social
					responsibility and justice to the  ethics of medical practice
					and research. Here we explore the  conflicts emerging out of
					the practice of ARTs and the extent to  which the proposed
					legislation <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Indian \Council of Medical Research. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill &amp; Rules - 2008. [Draft]. New Delhi: MOH&amp;FW, ICMR; 2008. [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/art/Draft%20ART %20(Regulation)%20Bill%20&amp;%20Rules%20-%202008-1.PDF" id="2">(2)</a> contains them by  reasserting ethical principles.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>ART and the medical  market</h4>
				<p>
					A significant percentage of babies in  developed countries in
					the West are born through IVF. Some of  these involve surrogacy,
					and reproductive tourism takes place  within the US and in
					some parts of Europe. In that part of  the world, the debate is
					focused on the ethics of surrogacy  rather than on the economic
					advantage of any particular region.</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, such an economic  advantage is seen in India,
					which is perceived as a hub of quality  ART services that can be
					had for one-fourth of the price in the  West. This explains the
					rush of foreign couples seeking  surrogacy (most commissioning
					parents in Indian clinics are from  outside the country) and ART,
					and the proliferating medical tourism  market in ART.</p>
				<p>
					There are two concerns about this  trend in India. The first is
					the <em>misuse of technology </em>causing  serious problems such as a
					declining sex ratio, rising caesarean  sections and overdiagnosis
					leading to unnecessary medical  procedures. The second is the <em>commodification of  body parts </em>such  as in the clandestine trade
					in kidneys, placentas and aborted  foetuses. When these trends
					are combined as in reproductive  technologies-the results are
					disturbing. There are reports of young  women being used to
					harvest oocytes or ova without their  informed consent on the
					risks and consequences of this  procedure; of clinics promoting
					IVF without the necessary technical  resources and human
					power; and of specialists organising  surrogacy contracts for
					foreign clients without ensuring the  security and rights of the
					surrogate mother or baby <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malpani Anirudh. Are we exploiting the infertile couple? Issues Med Ethics 2000 Jan-Mar; 8(1). [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/081or024.html" id="3">(3)</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Most of these problems are a  consequence of the
					unregulated ART industry-with varying  prices, standards
					and procedures-that gives primacy to  profits rather than
					the epidemiological needs of the majority in India. The  state ignores the need to prevent secondary infertility that is due
					to poor obstetric services and reproductive tract infections. It
					does not address the poor nutritional status of women which
					affects their ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term.
					And finally, it does not provide basic services to treat infertility.
					Instead, the private sector is given freedom to set up more
					ART clinics. This strategy is in line with its policy to encourage
					medical tourism to earn foreign exchange rather than protect
					the health of the majority. The ART industry is estimated to be
					worth $445 million <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="India Abroad News Service. 'Surrogacy a $445 mn business in India' 2008 Thaindian News. Aug 28. [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://" id="4">(4)</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Because the industry is so profitable, the limitations of this
					technology are not publicised. ARTs have relatively low success
					rates. They also pose risks to the gestational mother, the baby
					and the ovum donor. Among the complications are hyperovulation
					syndrome, multiple pregnancies and the risks of
					techniques such as foetal reduction. Babies from ARTs are
					more often of low birth weight and have a higher rate of birth
					abnormalities than babies born the conceived naturally. These
					facts are known to the profession but not made public.</p>
				<p>
					The state is under pressure from users of these technologies to
					keep the public informed of these risks and to regulate surrogacy.
					However, it is unwilling to let go of the financial advantage of this
					industry. So it has responded by hurriedly putting together a few
					ill thought out ideas to draft legislation for ART <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Indian Council of Medical Research. The Assisted Reproductive Technology(Regulation) Bill &amp; Rules - 2008. [Draft]. New Delhi: MOH&amp;FW, ICMR; 2008. [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/art/Draft%20ART%20(Regulation)%20Bill%20&amp;%20Rules%20-%202008-1.PDF" id="2">(2)</a>. This draft Bill
					is likely to be placed before Parliament shortly.</p>
				<p>
					It needs to be emphasised that legislation pertaining to
					only one aspect of health is not only insufficient but actually
					subversive, as it has the capacity to distract from the main
					thrust of policy. The ART Bill can be analysed only within the
					social context that we propose to explore.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Impact of technology on key definitions</h4>
				<p>
					Changing technologies influence not only the societies around
					them but also the very definitions of problems. For example, <em>surrogacy</em> changed its nature and definition with the evolution
					of ARTs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the mythological stories of Rohini in the Mahabharata who
					bore a child for Vasudev and Devaki, surrogacy would have
					involved sexual intercourse between the male partner and the
					surrogate. The technology of artificial insemination brought
					surrogacy into the domain of a more acceptable medical
					practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, with artificial insemination, the ova came from the
					surrogate mother, and the integrity of genetic and gestational
					aspects was retained. She was the biological mother and she
					chose to part with her baby and give it to another.
				</p>
				<p>
					This changed with in vitro fertilisation. After the techniques of
					ova harvesting and IVF and embryo transfer became popular, it
					was no longer necessary to use the surrogate's ova. Technology
					thus explicitly distinguished between the social and gestational
					value of mothers and genetic material that was now available
					through donors. It weakened the ideology of motherhood
					and the most commonly held ethical and legal position that a
					mother is the one who gives birth and genetic parents alone
					provide identity.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same time, nurturing and bonding acquired a new
					meaning with knowledge of genetics and of intrauterine
					and early development. It was established that for the child's
					genetic potential to unfold fully, it should be nurtured in a
					biologically optimum and socially secure environment. For the
					development of a well adjusted baby, the importance of not
					separating it from the gestational mother too early was thus
					laid by modern scientific knowledge. It established the need to
					practise a more inclusive and intimate form of surrogacy where
					the two families participate, and separation is delayed for three
					to six months for the welfare of the baby.
					In contrast to the area of child development, when we look
					at the medical definition of infertility (a couple's failure to
					conceive after one year of unprotected sexual intercourse),
					we find it inadequate, as it is based on social perception rather
					than a body of knowledge of pathology or of epidemiology.
					The definition is also undependable as it does not take
					into account the variation in social perceptions. Different
					communities accept different time gaps between marriage
					and conception. For example, this time gap is two years in
					rural Bangladesh <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nahar Papreen. Cultural construction of infertility in rural Bangladesh. Oral presentation at the Fourth Asia Pacific conference on reproductive and sexual health and rights. 2007 Oct." id="5">(5)</a>. So there is a need for a medically defined
					standard or guideline for when couples need reassurance and
					when medical intervention is necessary. Many couples without
					any specific diagnosis are declared infertile by the current
					medical definition and are made vulnerable to the vices of the
					market.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technologies of human organ donation and of surrogacy
					have shaped definitions differently. Human organ donation
					is restricted to a non-commercial transaction by the Human
					Organ Transplant Act, 1994. However, temporary lending of
					uterus on payment has not been objected to by the state. This
					irrational distinction between human body parts donated
					and those rented, and the equating of goods and living beings
					in commercial surrogacy, undermines the sacrifice made by
					surrogates, and their autonomy. Medical providers view it as
					an industry where the cheap "labour" of the Indian surrogate
					makes it a profitable venture for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Their logic obfuscates the distinction between the product
					of social human labour (consumable commodities) and the
					product of woman's procreative labour (a human baby). This
					distortion is the product of market liberalisation pushing
					profit-oriented, technocentric solutions for infertility instead of
					addressing its social determinants.
				</p>
				<p>
					By using healthy women as means of reproduction for the
					infertile, on a commercial basis, the experts create the same
					inequality of power and control in ART clinics as in patriarchal
					society. Even when surrogacy is seen in the market framework
					a key issue is the definition of compensation. To understand
					this, the irrationality of blurring the definitions of production
					and procreation needs to be underlined. There is no way to put
					a value on the product of the latter (a baby), except arbitrarily.
					Therefore, its value has to be the same as anywhere else in the
					world even if the Third World provides cheap human labour
					and technological services such as ART.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the US not only is surrogacy many times more expensive
					than it is in India, the surrogate is better provided for. In
					addition to medical expenses related to the pregnancy, the surrogate is given health insurance for the period of
					involvement, medical insurance for her family as she is the
					caretaker for them and expenses including for maternity care
					and clothing. In addition expenses for the independent lawyer
					that she would employ are paid by the commissioning parents
					<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Assisted Reproduction Center. Surrogacy programme costs and payment options. [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://www. fertilityhelp.com/CM/Surrogacy/Estimated_Expenses_For_Complete_ Surrogacy_program.asp" id="6">(6)</a>. As a country claiming to have "international standards" and
					"world class" institutions, India should strive for these norms
					and no less. The reality is that while in the US up to 50% of
					the cost of ART with a surrogate arrangement goes to the
					surrogate, in India most of the money is appropriated by the
					sperm banks, clinics and lawyers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Social context of surrogacy and ART</h4>
				<p>
					New reproductive technologies claim to help human beings
					through creative interventions that reduce suffering and have
					the potential to transform society. The commercialisation of
					surrogacy, however, creates several social conflicts rather than
					resolving a few. It generates family pressure on poor women to
					offer their wombs for a price. Almost one third of Indian women
					are extremely vulnerable due to poverty, marginalisation in
					labour and job markets, patriarchal social and family structures
					and low educational levels. For them, in particular, the financial
					gain through surrogacy becomes a key push factor. It is well
					known that most surrogate mothers are from not so well-off
					sections and their primary motive to become surrogates is
					monetary. This makes their economic exploitation easy for the
					agents working for commissioning parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Procreation and infertility must be interpreted within
					constructs like patriarchy and within existing social and
					economic inequalities. The same is true for surrogacy. The
					use of ART to "help" infertile couples adds new conflicts. For
					example, the way ART is practised reduces parents into objects
					of medical experimentation and sanitises the mystique of
					biological evolution. Surrogates frankly accept monetary
					motives (treatment, education and housing for family
					members) but face the dilemma that being a surrogate is
					socially unacceptable. So rather than tell their neighbours that
					they gave away their child, they tell them that the baby died.
					The government's view on this subject is a matter of concern.
					In a meeting convened by the Ministry of Women and Child
					Welfare in June 2008, a minister of the government stated that
					the fact that these women get amounts equalling two-three
					years of their wages can not be ignored. This is indicative of the
					mood in the government that sees surrogacy as a replacement
					for employment guarantee and adequate subsistence.
					Another area of concern in the use of ARTs is for the disability
					and women's movement. This is around the narrowing of
					choices for couples in the name of expanding choices. Gender,
					disability and infertility are social constructs. Yet, the Preconception
					and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (regulation
					and prevention of misuse) Act gives parents the absolute
					right to abort a disabled foetus. The use of preimplantational
					genetic diagnosis in ART gives the option to eliminate disability
					without defining any limits to this option. Thus, the selective
					exclusion of the disabled and of girls has become possible
					through ART <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ghai A, Johri R. Prenatal diagnosis: Where do we draw the line? Indian Journal of Gender Studies 2008 May-Aug; 15(2): 291-316" id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are cases of the surrogate refusing to part with the baby,
					but being unable to pay back the sum received. There are
					also instances of the surrogate changing her mind about the
					pregnancy and opting for abortion. Such actions conflict with
					the interests of the commissioning parents and the reputation
					and profits of the providers. They therefore seek regulation
					through legislation. These interests are well represented on the
					drafting committee of the ART Bill.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surrogacy can also affect older children's perception of the
					values and integrity of their family unless there is transparency
					and involvement of the commissioning/social mother right
					through the pregnancy. Secrecy and anonymity create a
					negative environment that affects human relations within and
					outside families.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet another issue that emerges is children's right to information
					about the identity of their parents. At present this right may
					be exercised in adulthood, though the sense of belonging
					and socialisation begins very early. The global experience of
					adoption teaches us that the urge to know one's roots brings
					young adults back to unknown people. Why then fit surrogacy
					in the old patriarchal mould of secrecy and anonymity, instead
					of changing norms and making the process more transparent?
					For the commissioning mother, being involved with baby care
					right from the beginning while it is breastfed, and knowing the
					surrogate through the pregnancy, might be a step forward. It
					might make adaptation less difficult for all concerned. These
					questions need to be examined and not set aside simply to
					push the surrogacy markets. Secrecy and anonymity are rooted
					in the social value of the primacy of "blood relations". This itself
					derives from notions of exclusivity and superiority-the very
					essence of eugenics. The present practices, instead of openly
					questioning these values, harm children by letting them grow
					up with false notions of belonging and then pushing them into
					a search for identity, a sense of shame and anger against their
					social parents <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rubin S. Reproductive options 1: a sperm donor baby grows up. In Zimmerman J, editor. The Technological woman: interfacing with tomorrow. New York: Praeger; 1986. 211-5." id="8">(8)</a>. An open and frank environment could be
					much more conducive to accepting their status.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, the present restrictive policy towards the sexuality of
					same sex couples denies them open access to ART despite
					sufficient scientific basis establishing the biological validity
					of their distinct sexualities. The legislation chooses to remain
					silent on their need for a family, reflecting a lack of initiative to
					question obsolete social mores.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surrogacy as it is practised is heavily biased against the baby.
					It requires the surrogate mother not to get too involved with
					the growing baby in her body. The baby has no say in the
					matter and has to live the consequences of the social process.
					The baby's right to bonding and breast feeding for a minimum
					period of three to six months is denied. Also the very right to
					survival of all babies born out of ART-whether disabled or one
					of a multiple pregnancy-is undermined as they are not treated
					at par with other babies but depend upon the whims of their
					commissioning parents for survival.
				</p>
				<p>
					These emerging social practices protect the interests of the
					market and negate almost all the principles of medical ethics
					enunciated earlier. Is the draft Bill any different?

				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The draft ART (Regulation) Bill, 2008</h4>
				<p>
					A huge infrastructure is proposed for registration and
					standardisation of clinics and sperm banks. However, there willbe little effort to regularly monitor the success rates of different
					techniques. The focus is on research in and popularisation of
					ART rather than on stopping the misuse of technology and the
					exploitation of donors and surrogates. This is illustrated in the
					following examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					An extremely inadequate and open format for a private contract
					between surrogates and commissioning parents permits the
					continued exploitation of surrogates. It does not address concerns
					such as issues of health, informed consent, compensation and
					legal assistance. This is despite the fact that the Bill recognises
					surrogacy as "pregnancy achieved in furtherance of ART", and
					therefore acknowledges its imperfection.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bill also propagates the patriarchal and eugenic values
					of exclusivity by giving primacy to genetic parenthood. It
					goes to the extent of denying the right of the surrogate to
					be registered as the birthing mother and directly transfers
					parentage to protect the right of the buyer at the cost of the
					baby. At the same time the interests of clinics and sperm banks
					are fully protected. All risks are transferred to the surrogate-be
					it her death, complications during foetal reduction or the
					transfer of infections such as HIV.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bill denies the critical developmental needs of the
					baby and in order to make separation easy and quick for a
					commercial surrogate, ensures fast separation. It also bans the
					donation of ova by her. It goes to the extent of permitting three
					surrogate births to a woman and three cycles of ova transfer for
					a single couple without any reference to the health risks to the
					surrogate. At the same time the right to demand abortion and
					pregnancy reduction is given to the commissioning parents
					and the surrogate is bound to oblige. No attention is paid to
					the right of the surrogate to keep the baby if she changes her
					mind early or due to the death of her own child.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, same sex parents do not get any recognition by the
					draft though single parents can access the technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					The question of the identity of a parent is clouded by secrecy
					and anonymity. No effort is made to bring about a degree of
					openness and co-operation between the two families to secure
					the welfare of the baby.
				</p>
				<p> The Bill not only openly protects and promotes unregulated
				commercial surrogacy, it also contradicts existing national
				policies on health and family welfare. These contradictions are: </p>
				
					<ol type="a">
						<li>The state has a two-child policy to ensure stable populations
						and women's health. Those opting for surrogacy cannot be
						exceptions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Maternal mortality, which is a matter of great concern for the
						government, will by no means decline if surrogacy practices
						permit nine possible cycles of transplant of ova (a maximum
						of three cycles for a single commissioning couple and three
						surrogate babies in a lifetime irrespective of the number of her
						own children).
					</li>
					<li>
						The state's public policy is against gender exploitation, but
						gender-based economic and social exploitation is built into
						present surrogacy practice.
					</li>
					<li>
						The sale of children, human trafficking and sale of body parts
						are illegal activities as is evident in the laws for trafficking and
						human organ transplant. Yet commercial surrogacy is being
						promoted.
					</li>
					<li>
						India is a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the
						Child and committed to the protection of children before and
						after their birth. Yet the present legislation does not ensure that
						child rights are fully protected.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The fact that the drafting committee was not concerned about
					these contradictions is reason enough to demand that these
					questions be thrown open to a public debate to find how best
					the interests of the baby, the surrogate mother or the adopting
					parents could be looked after within an ethical frame.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such a move will help evolve a more widely accepted
					legislation, particularly as the social complexity in this country
					gives rise to many views regarding infertility and surrogacy.
					Accordingly, there are those who are completely against
					surrogacy on ethical and ideological grounds, those who fully
					support it even as a commercial venture, those who accept
					it but oppose its commercialisation and those who on the
					very basis of ideology say that commercial surrogacy - if well
					regulated - is a way to question patriarchal notions of family
					and society. It is interesting that within feminists, one set
					encourages adoption and questions the eugenic tendencies
					of genetic manipulation that reinforce patriarchal notions of
					paternity and the other uses genetic manipulation to attack
					the traditional family. These counter currents raise significant
					challenges for law and policy makers genuinely interested in
					the regulation of ART and surrogacy. It would therefore be in
					their interest to listen carefully.
