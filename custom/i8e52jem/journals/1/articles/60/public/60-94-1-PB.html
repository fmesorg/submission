				<h4>SP Kaushik, J Sethi, AK Saihjpal, editors. Ethics in
				medical and health care. Unistar Books; 2012. 216 pp.
				Hardcover. INR 395. ISBN 9789382246237</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Ethics in medical and health care</em> is a commendable compilation  													of essays that describe the ethical dilemmas and deficiencies in  													the healthcare scenario in India with the intention to sensitise  													all stakeholders to the urgent need for introspection and reform  													in this sector. It is a documentation of the discussions and  													presentations at SARATHI 2010, a national conference on ethics  													in healthcare organised by the University Institute of Applied  													Management Sciences, Punjab University in collaboration with  													the Senior Citizens' Council for Human Resource Development,  													held at Chandigarh in 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr SP Kaushik, an eminent professor of surgical  													gastroenterology, has edited the contributions and authored  													a few chapters. The other editors are Jitendra Sethi, professor  													of English, and Anil Saihjpal, professor of law from Chandigarh.  													Most of the authors are from hospital or pharmaceutical  													management with a few contributions from doctors and  													lawyers. The topics range from research ethics, clinical ethics  													and drug marketing to hospital informatics and quackery.
				</p>
				<p>
					The chapter on malpractice by Dr Kaushik outlines the  													reasons for the poor quality and standards in healthcare and  													ethical practice. Dr Sandhu describes misconduct and corrupt  													behaviour. In separate chapters, specialities such as surgery  													and anaesthesia are scoped in depth, with citations of ethical  													lapses in current practice, and the systemic failure of oversight  													mechanisms or peer review in addressing them. The discussion  													on regulation and legislation deals with some amendments  													and broad application of the laws. The Medical Termination of  													Pregnancy Act, 1971, The Transplantation of Human Organs  													Act, 1994, and the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, are points of  													focus along with their shortcomings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The three essays on research ethics and clinical trials  													predictably paint a dismal and unpromising picture of this  													area with statistics and reports of unethical trials. There is  													much described about unethical marketing practices of  													pharmaceutical companies with lurid stories about the nexus  													with doctors. It includes an interesting detailed breakdown of  													prices of commonly used drugs, the shocking retail mark-up  													and a comparison of brand and generic prices. The discussion  													on the Patents Act sketches out the areas of special interest for  													a country like India with inadequate access to cost-effective  													care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two chapters on hospital information systems and  													information management focus on the unaddressed issues  													of patient data management and use. Aside from issues of  													confidentiality and consent, these chapters also cover the  													possibility of unplanned use of data, training of all cadres  													of healthcare personnel on protection of information, and  													autonomy of the patient. Insurance companies and employers  													may gain access to integrated health delivery systems,  													leading to violation of privacy - an area which begs for  													regulation. Similarly, the topic on E-Health targets validity and  													confidentiality issues related to online health information,  													databases and health services.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a very interesting focus on the history and evolution  													of the practice of 'quackery' in a chapter strangely titled  													"Roadside Romeos". Towards the end of the book is an essay  													on hospital waste that shares alarming statistics of re-use of  													disposables, and another that outlines arguments for and  													against euthanasia.
				</p>
				<p>
					With medical practice and healthcare such a vast and complex  													field, it is no simple task to include or address all of the ethical  													issues that are encountered therein. This book makes a start  													in expressing and acknowledging the size of some of the  													problems we face in the Indian context. It is not difficult  													reading, in spite of the subject, as the format is short essays and  													chapters. The downside is that there tends to be only superficial  													description of some extremely complex and nuanced situations  													in healthcare. In some instances, such cursory handling of  													controversial ethical issues can be misleading. The discussion  													on stem cell therapy offers the impression that it is already the  													standard of care in non-haematopoietic applications. There is  													an erroneous remark that the ministry of tourism advertises  													kidney transplantation on its website. Some repetitions on  													general principles of ethics and research ethics in different  													chapters could have been avoided.
				</p>
				<p>
					This book is an excellent first read for healthcare personnel  													to get a bird's eye view of some of the ethical dilemmas  													encountered by the medical profession in India. It could  													sensitise patients and doctors, as well as nurses, technicians,  													medical administrators, the pharmaceutical industry and health  													planners to the high expectations of ethical behaviour in health  													care and health delivery, and expose areas of corrupt practice  													or misconduct in urgent need of reform and regulation.
