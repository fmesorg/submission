				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					The emergence of web-based medical tourism facilitators (MTFs) has added a new dimension to the phenomenon of cross-border travel. These facilitators are crucial connectors between foreign patients and host countries. They help patients navigate countries, doctors and specialties. However, little attention has been paid to the authenticity   of information displayed on the facilitators' web portals, and whether   they follow ethical guidelines and standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					This paper analyses the available information on MTF portals from an ethics perspective. It compares 208 facilitators across 47   countries for the services offered. Data were collected from the databases of the Medical Tourism Association and World Medical   Resources. India was the most common destination country linked to 81 facilitators. The five countries with the maximum number of facilitators   were the USA, the UK, India, Canada and Poland. This paper identifies concerns regarding the information displayed about patients' safety, and   the maintenance of confidentiality. There is a need to develop ethical   standards for this field.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					With globalisation, the world has shrunk even as the global healthcare industry has grown. The consequent integration of world economies has had a considerable impact on the health trade <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rondinelli DA, Heffron JM, editors.

					Medical tourism involves patients travelling from their home country to a foreign country, where they must make arrangements for their treatment and stay. When seeking care in a foreign country, patients use various agents including insurance companies and healthcare providers <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gan LL, Frederick JR.

				<p>
					As web portals are here to stay, the quality and range of information that they provide need to be examined critically. Understanding the role and functioning of MTF portals as mediators between patients and clinicians is crucial, as patients know the physician or the hospital almost entirely as presented on the portals <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mason A, Wright K. Framing medical tourism: An examination of appeal, risk, convalescence, accreditation and interactivity in medical tourism web sites. J Health Commun.2011 Feb;16(2):163-77." id="11">(11)</a>. There are few studies examining the quality of information displayed on web portals. This paper analyses the content of information exhibited on web portals through an ethics lens.

					The business of MTFs is dependent on international travel. They perform the important function of bridging the gap between industry players and consumers <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Connell J. Medical tourism: sea, sun, sand and surgery. Tour Manag. 2006; 27:1093-100." id="16">(16)</a>. Facilitators select and differentiate their services in several ways, depending on the countries and hospitals which they network. These websites show a pattern with respect to region and   speciality <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mason A, Wright K. Framing medical tourism: An examination of appeal, risk, convalescence, accreditation and interactivity in medical tourism web sites. J Health Commun.2011 Feb;16(2):163-77." id="11">(11)</a>. This strategy helps them to take advantage of the niche   services provided in a country and handle the competition.

				</p>
				<p>
					There is no control over the type of information displayed on websites. A study based on 'framing theory' shows that positively framed information – such as when web portals carry photographs of accredited hospitals equipped with the latest technology, or success stories of   foreign patients can influence consumers' decisions <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mason A, Wright K.

				<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p>
					This exploratory study was designed to carry out a content   analysis of the information displayed by medical tourism facilitator web   portals. Two databases, the Medical Tourism Association (MTA) and World Medical Resources (WMR), which had facilitator directories, were referred to for the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					MTA is an international business association linked with different   stakeholders in the healthcare industry in order to bring them together   for business purposes in the medical tourism industry. It has its own research and publications in the field of medical tourism. On the home page, the portal   (<a href="http://www.medicaltourismassociation.com/en/mta-facilitators.html" target="_blank">http://www.medicaltourismassociation.com/en/mta-facilitators.html</a>) has a   link to the listings of MTFs under the category of members of MTA.  The   other source, World Medical Resources, is a web portal   (<a href="http://www.worldmedicalresources.com" target="_blank">www.worldmedicalresources.com </a>) that provides comprehensive listings of   healthcare providers, hospitals and tourism facilitators all over the  globe.

				<h4>Selection of web portals</h4>
				<p>
					The MTA website had an alphabetically ordered list of MTFs across 46 destination countries. Six of these 46 countries had dysfunctional   links and had to be dropped. MTF portals were then selected from the   remaining countries and 86 MTF portals were obtained for data analysis. The WMR directory had a list of 254 MTF web portals, of which 132   portals were repetitions and had to be dropped, leaving 122 web portals. A total of 208 MTF web portals were identified for the analysis from   both sources. All the web portals provided an English translation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information from each web portal was collected under various categories such as services provided, networking countries and quality of informed consent, privacy and confidentiality, keeping in mind their   relevance to the ethics framework. Whether or not information on   specific points was provided was also noted.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Findings</h4>
				<p>
					The 208 facilitators identified were spread across 47 countries in Asia, Europe, the US and Canada, indicating the global character of this industry. The five countries with the maximum number of facilitators were the USA (41), the UK (36), India (18), Canada (12) and Poland (10). Regarding international associations with India, 80% of   the facilitators from the USA had a network with India, followed by   Canada and the UK (Table 1).

				<h4>Common destination countries</h4>
				<p>
					The homepage of each web portal was studied for information on the   destination countries with which it networked. Table 2 displays the 20   most frequently networked destination countries. India was the most common destination for medical tourism, linked to 81 facilitators (Table 2) from 18 countries (Table 1). The other common destinations recorded   were Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico, Singapore and Malaysia.

					The facilitators were segregated into two categories domestic and international based on their network with a destination country. Domestic facilitators were defined as those which promoted medical tourism services for their own country. Government facilitators as well   as private domestic MTFs belonged to this category and displayed information about their country or even a particular state. International facilitators were defined as those which networked with one or more destination countries providing medical tourism services. Out of the 208 MTFs, 117 were domestic facilitators and the rest international (Table 3).

				<h4>Display of information</h4>
				<p>
					All the portals visited were examined for the type of information they provided. All provided general information price comparisons across countries, patient testimonials, language options, frequently asked questions, and free membership opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cost is considered to be the major pull factor for medical tourists and web portals are cashing in on this aspect. Out of 120 MTFs displaying information about prices, 36 provided a price comparison between the prices in the host country with various destination countries. For example, prices for various medical procedures such as bypass surgery or knee replacement were compared across the USA, the UK, India, Singapore and Thailand. Such comparisons are a good strategy for attracting healthcare consumers. The remaining facilitators provided   quotes for the various procedures offered. About half of the international web portals provided information in multiple languages for   easier access to their customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients' testimonials usually appeared on the side columns and described good experiences of medical tourists with the hospital or the   doctor. Web portals providing cosmetic service information carried 'before and after' photographs of patients. A few portals also displayed a free membership offer (Table 4).

					All 208 MTFs offered information about different procedures.   Information about the types of procedures was collected from the home   pages of the web portals. Details of each procedure were obtained by   further clicking the name of the procedure. The most common services   were medical and cosmetic procedures, followed by ophthalmic and dental   services (Table 5). Specialised surgical procedures covered heart   surgeries including bypass and angiography, hip replacement procedures,   etc. Cosmetic procedures included weight loss techniques, breast   augmentation surgeries and body sculpting procedures. Some portals were   dedicated to dental and eye procedures. Ophthalmic procedures were   chiefly LASIK operations. Most of the portals providing cosmetic   services were also linked to dental services providing "smile designing   techniques".

					About 90% <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="C'onnell J. Medical tourism: sea, sun, sand and surgery.

					Even though cost is the main driving factor for health travel,   destination and quality of care become major determinants in selecting a   healthcare facility <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eysenbach G, Yihune G, Lampe K, Cross P, Brickley D.

The name of the hospital, its accreditation,   the doctors attached to it, and their qualifications are all part of the   quality of care.

					It is important to know what kind of information web portals   provide about health or health providers from the perspective of safety.   Data were collected by clicking on the links available on the home   pages of the portals. For example, the "attached hospital" link was   viewed for more details on whether the hospital had any kind of quality   assurance in the form of international or national regulation. 94 web   portals provided information about their hospital accreditation. 42 out   of 94 web portals showed a mark of Joint Commissioner International   accreditation. Some others were accredited by local regulatory bodies.   72 provided information about clinicians, which included their   qualifications, years of experience and, in some instances their   biodatas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other equally important aspects are privacy and confidentiality.   The websites studied displayed patient information in the form of   testimonials and photographs, along with the type of treatment taken,   and other details.  Such information could be very sensitive and   patients may not want to disclose it. It is not clear whether patients   gave consent for these details to be made public.   Only 27 web portals   mentioned confidentiality on their websites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any surgery requires some post-operative care and follow-up. This   is particularly important when patients undergo treatment in one country   and then return to their home country. Aftercare can add to the cost of   treatment. Aftercare was given the least importance by the portals,   usually described in a one line reply as part of the frequently asked   questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Quality of care is not restricted to providing treatment in an   accredited hospital;  the patient should also be made aware of the risks   associated with the medical procedure. There was no mention of informed   consent on the web portals.  In addition, only one of the web sites   displayed information about patients' rights.

				<h4>Emerging ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					The quality of all online information varies widely <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eysenbach G. Consumer health informatics.

Ethical challenges of medicine and health on internet: A review. J Med Internet Res.2001 Apr-Jun;3(2):e23." id="1"> 24)</a> and this applies to medical tourism web portals as well. The internet allows unqualified personnel easy entry into the health services trade. In the absence of a conventional doctor-patient relationship in which doctors are governed by a code of conduct <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dyer KA. Ethical challenges of medicine and health on internet: A" id="1">(24)</a>, services provided by intermediaries such as MTFs which might involve non-medical personnel need ethical guidelines and regulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that these facilitators continue to grow in numbe indicates their demand in the market <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical tourism research: The Treatment Abroad Medical Tourism Survey. [Internet]. 2007. [cited November 20, 2010]. Available from: www. treatmentabroad.com/about/medical-tourism-survey/2007" id="19">(19)</a>. By their nature, web portals give ease of access to information that individual medical tourists cannot gather on their own. These facilitators do not provide direct access to services, but they have different strategies to attract consumers in the form of packaged tours with attractive prices, and variety in services, which can influence the decision-making process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients may be attracted by price comparisons and perceived   quality of care. However, important issues such as confidentiality of information, aftercare and patient's rights are not prominently discussed on these sites <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lunt N, Hardey M, Mannion R. Nip, tuck and click: Medical tourism and the emergence of web-based health information. [Internet]. Open Med Inform J[Internet]; 2010[cited 2012 Dec 25] ;4:1-11. Available from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2874214/" id="1">(4)</a>.

When medical information is posted without any data protection, the confidentiality of patients' personal information is compromised. Further, medical tourists return to their home country after the treatment, so providing information about aftercare is very important <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Turner L. Quality in health care and globalization of health services: accreditation and regulatory oversight of medical tourism companies. Int J Qual Healthcare 2011;23(1):1-7." id="1">(25)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that none of the websites mentions patients' rights should be taken into consideration at the time of formulating guidelines. Special attention is needed as MTFs not only provide information but also influence the decision making of the patient. The proliferation of MTFs raises ethical concerns that highlight the need for regulatory measures.

				<h4>Recommendations</h4>
				<p>
					Health information on the internet is used by different consumers for various purposes. It is difficult to bring this information under one regulatory umbrella. International agencies like WHO and UNESCO are involved in formulating ethical guidelines for the quality of health information on the internet <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dyer KA. Ethical challenges of medicine and health on internet: A review. J Med Internet Res.2001 Apr-Jun;3(2):e23." id="1">(24)</a>. Certification from MedPICS Certification and Rating of Trustworthy Health Information on the Net (MedCERTAIN) also evaluates such information <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eysenbach G, Yihune G, Lampe K, Cross P, Brickley D.

J Med Internet Res. 2000 Oct-Dec;2(suppl 2):e1." id="1">(20)</a>. The American Medical Association has recently developed guidelines for medical tourism companies <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="American Medical Association [Internet].

The need has also been expressed for a standard set of operations for MTFs, including certification <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Turner L.

				</p>
				<p>
					The four basic principles for evaluating e-health information are; self regulation, evaluation of information, regulation and awareness of users <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eysenbach G, Yihune G, Lampe K, Cross P, Brickley D. Quality management, certification and rating of health information on the net with MedCERTAIN: using a medPICS/RDF/XML metadata structure for Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Vol X No 1 January-March 2013 implementing ehealth ethics and creating trust globally. J Med Internet Res. 2000 Oct-Dec;2(suppl 2):e1." id="1">(20)</a>. These can be the pillars of a regulatory framework, whose outline is given below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The quality of information provided on the portals can be maintained through self regulation by the MTFs. They are not only responsible for sharing health information but also play an important role in the patients' choice of provider.
					</li>
					<li>
						MTF portals can also be evaluated and rated by health professionals to enable patients to better determine the quality of information. They should also receive accreditation by international bodies.
					</li>
					<li>
						Information about the health provider is a decisive factor while choosing a hospital. MTFs should ensure that they provide correct information about the education, qualification and years of experience along with the registration details of the provider.
					</li>
					<li>
						MTFs must ensure information shared by patients on these sites is kept confidential.
					</li>
					<li>
						Patients should receive information on the potential risks of a   procedure, as well as any risk associated with their travel and stay, before they make a decision to use medical tourism.
					</li>
					<li>
						The medical tourist must be informed of relevant health regulations and ethical guidelines in the country where s/he is going for treatment.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					E-health is a multidisciplinary field involving many diverse players. Facilitators must be educated about the ethical aspects of patient care, prevented from exploiting patients or clients, and made to respect their privacy and confidentiality. They must be subject to  regulation at the international level by an organisation that has the power to enforce its decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is equally important to assess consumers' perceptions and educate them on the information displayed on web portals and its implications. Ethical guidelines must also be established and followed if these MTF companies are to build the trust and reliance of patients.
