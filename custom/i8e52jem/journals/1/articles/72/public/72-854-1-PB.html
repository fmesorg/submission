				<h4>Remembering Edmund Pellegrino</h4>
				<p>
					I was shocked and saddened to read the news that
					Dr Edmund Pellegrino, 92, professor emeritus of medicine
					and medical ethics and senior scholar at Georgetown
					University's Kennedy Institute of Ethics, passed away on
					June 13, just nine days before his 93rd birthday . A former
					director of Georgetown's Kennedy Institute of Ethics at
					Washington, DC, he founded and directed the university's
					Center for Clinical Bioethics 22 years ago. Just this year it
					was renamed the Edmund D Pellegrino Center for Clinical
					Bioethics. Dr Pellegrino also served as chairman of the
					President's Council on Bioethics from 2005 to 2009. He was
					re-appointed as interim director of the Center for Clinical
					Bioethics at Georgetown University Medical Center in 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pellegrino's research interests included the history
					and philosophy of medicine, professional ethics, and the
					physician-patient relationship. A famous quote of his,
					which he borrowed from Einstein to describe the mission
					of the Edmund D Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics,
					was: "Science can tell you how things relate to each other
					- science will never tell you what you ought to do."
				</p>
				<p>
					In the midst of all this institutional activity, Dr. Pellegrino
					maintained a stellar academic career that spanned decades.
					Not only did he author or co-author over 600 articles and
					23 books, his work is considered seminal in the areas of
					medical ethics, physician-patient relationships, physician
					responsibility and virtue ethics in healthcare.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had the proud privilege of learning and interacting with
					this great scholar and physician known as the "father" of
					bioethics in America, and a man who has received almost
					every award possible in the area of bioethics, while on
					a fellowship programme at the Kennedy Institute of
					Ethics along with Dr Rema Mathew from the Tuberculosis
					Research Centre, Chennai, in August 1997. A senior emeritus
					professor at that time, Dr Pellegrino gave us a few personal
					lectures on some important aspects of the physician patient
					relationship and clinical ethics. He was a staunch
					Catholic, skilled and dedicated to fostering interdisciplinary,
					inter-religious and cross-cultural dialogue to increase the
					understanding of the Roman Catholic tradition of medical
					ethics, and the ethical and religious directives for Catholic
					healthcare service. He made us realise, for the first time,
					the dilemmas faced while treating patients belonging
					to different religions with different convictions, without
					making moral judgements and decisions based on one's
					own personal beliefs but depending on the patient's
					choices. Since clinical ethics was not taught to us in our
					medical curriculum -- this is true even today -- we were
					simply awestruck by his scholarly deliberations on various
					aspects of the physician-patient relationship. We had extensive discussions on the case of Jehovah's Witnesses
					and physicians' dilemmas in handling such patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pellegrino had a child-like curiosity to learn from us
					about the Indian scenario with its multi-cultural, multireligious
					perspectives and the consequent practical
					difficulties faced in healthcare and health research. We
					also had the opportunity to discuss with him terminally
					ill patients and the ethical dilemmas in caring for their
					welfare. It was an enlightening experience to learn, from this
					great scholar, the fine distinction between withholding
					and withdrawing life support and the ethicality of such
					decisions being made in daily patient care in hospitals. He
					would often say: "The capacity to make moral judgments,
					and to be self-critical, is part of being an educated person."
					About what he did with ethics, he said: "I don't set out to
					make trouble, but when I do cause a stir, it's only because I
					raise questions that strike me as unavoidable."
				</p>
				<p>
					In discussions on trust and the professions, he argued,
					"Any successful working relation between a doctor and
					the patient must be founded on some degree of trust;
					but taking informed consent cannot be considered as an
					alternative to trust as it only presupposes trust. Physicians
					have specialised knowledge about health, diseases and
					treatment which patients do not. If patients are to make
					informed decisions they have to acquire some of that
					knowledge. They can and shall acquire this knowledge only
					from physicians. Relations between doctors and patients are
					typically characterised by urgency, intimacy, unavoidability,
					unpredictability and extraordinary vulnerability. We may be
					able to reduce that vulnerability but can never eliminate it."
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout his career, Dr Pellegrino remained involved
					in clinical medicine as practitioner, bedside teacher and
					clinical ethicist. In his 90th year, he continued to mentor
					students, attend ethics grand rounds in Georgetown
					Hospital, and write and speak nationally and internationally.
					A legend in medical humanities and clinical ethics, he
					was a human being <em>par excellence</em> and treated us, novices
					in the field of bioethics, as colleagues and shared his
					vast knowledge and experience enthusiastically. It was a
					memorable experience to learn from this doyen of ethics,
					although for a short period, which Dr Rema and I will
					cherish forever.
