					Financial compensation to participants in clinical trials for
					the immediate and long-term medical treatment of injuries
					sustained while participating in the trials, and payment to their
					next of kin when such injuries result in death, is a relatively
					neglected subject, particularly in developing countries. Some
					countries do not require investigators and/or sponsors to
					indemnify research participants against trial-related injury
					or death through insurance cover, while others do. In the
					case of the latter, the indemnity limit and determination of
					the quantum of compensation is dependent on the terms
					outlined in the insurance contract, assuming one exists.
					Furthermore, any actual compensation is ultimately left to the
					discretion of the sponsor or clinical trial insurer. The recent
					promulgation of regulations on such compensation by India <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Harmonisation. Guideline for good clinical practice [Internet]. ICH; 1996 [cited 2013 May 19]. Available from: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6_R1/Step4/E6_R1__Guideline.pdf" id="1">(1)</a> is thus noteworthy. While the new regulations are a reaction
					to the Indian Supreme Court's finding that India's Central Drugs
					Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) failed to protect the
					rights of participants in trials <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A. New regulations on compensation for injury and death in drug trials. Indian J Med Ethics [Internet]. 2013Apr-Jun [cited 2013 May 28];10(2):76-9. Available from: http://ijme.in/pdfs/212ed76.pdf" id="2">(2)</a> and are intended to enhance
					the rights of the participants, the regulations are deficient in
					several respects and may have unforeseen consequences for
					India's wider population.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Impact on research sponsorship and India's
				population at large</h4>
				<p>
					Since India's promulgation of the aforementioned regulations,
					the number of approvals for clinical trials and applications
					by sponsors for such approvals in the country has dropped
					drastically <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="PTI. Post stringent norms, clinical trials in India plummet Thehindu. com [Internet]. 2013 Apr 21[cited 2013 May 28]. Available from: http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/post-stringent-norms-clinical-trials-in-india-plummet/article4639976.ece" id="3">(3)</a>. It is clear that the regulations are having a
					dampening effect on research in India. Put differently, research
					sponsors seem to regard the regulations as barriers to
					conducting clinical trials. While the authorities should always
					view the welfare of the participants in clinical trials as being
					of paramount importance, they also need to be mindful of the
					fact that India has many health needs, as well as gaps in the
					areas of policy and knowledge of practice. Research is crucial
					for addressing these needs and gaps, and inspiring evidencebased
					practice and policy reforms at a wider population
					level. The enactment of impractical or illogical regulations
					will impede such research and could inadvertently facilitate
					and entrench gaps in knowledge. Apart from discouraging
					the sponsorship of research, and by extension, research in
					the country, the regulations are also deficient in several other
					respects.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Should placebo-controlled and investigational
				product trials be discouraged?</h4>
				<p>
					India's new regulations provide for the compensation of injury
					or death arising from "the failure of [an] <em>investigational</em> product to provide intended therapeutic effect" [Rule 122-DAB (5)(c)]and from "the use of a placebo in a placebo-controlled trial" [Rule 122-DAB (5)(d)]. Both provisions are counterintuitive and violate the principle of equipoise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Investigational products are investigational for a reason. While a therapeutic effect may be hoped for at the initiation of a study, the efficacy of an investigational product is not known,
					or not supposed to be known, until a study's conclusion. The
					apparent requirement that an investigator has to ensure
					that the investigational product possesses an "intended" therapeutic effect would imply that the investigator must
					know, with reasonable certainty, the efficacy of the product
					before its employment in the trial. The possession of such
					knowledge would violate a basic tenet of research-the
					principle of equipoise-which dictates that there must be
					<em>genuine uncertainty</em> at the outset on the part of the investigator
					regarding the purported efficacy or effectiveness of an
					investigational drug, device, or product. India's new regulations
					thus place investigators in an untenable position: they are
					to ensure that the investigational drug "provides intended
					therapeutic effect" or pay compensation for its failing to do so. This provision could lead to interpretation bias on the part of the investigator and would detract from the credibility of the results of Indian trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					With regard to the regulations' provision on placebo-controlled trials, the very nature of a placebo is its confirmed inert / inefficacious state. Placebos are not supposed to demonstrate efficacy or effectiveness. It is thus counterintuitive and illogical to compensate trial participants for injuries or deaths that "arise from the use of placebo in a placebo-controlled trial." It would appear that India's new regulations are aimed at discouraging placebo-controlled trials. This is contrary to the position of the Declaration of Helsinki <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association. Declaration of Helsinki-Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects [Internet]. Geneva:WMA; 2008 [cited 2013 May 19]. Available from: http://www.wma.net/ en/30publications/10policies/b3/" id="4">(4)</a> and the Council for the International Organisations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Guidelines <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for the International Organisations of Medical Sciences. International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects [Internet]. Geneva:CIOMS; 2002 [cited 2013 May 19]. Available from: http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf" id="5">(5)</a>, both of which endorse placebo-controlled trials in particular circumstances, such as if no known intervention exists for the health condition under investigation.
				</p>

				<h4>Who decides eligibility for compensation and
				quantum?</h4>
				<p>
					While insurance cover for participants in clinical trials is
					not mandatory in many countries, some countries require
					investigators and/or sponsors to have a no-fault insurance
					cover for the participants in their trials to comply with good
					clinical practice (GCP), on the basis of the guidelines published
					by the International Conference on Harmonisation <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Gazette of India Extraordinary. Part II- Section3-Subsection (i). Regd. No.D.L-33004/99.No. 47. Published by Authority [Internet]. New Delhi: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Dept of Health);2013 Jan 30 [cited 2013 May 19]. Available from: http://www.elsevierbi. com/~/media/Supporting%20Documents/Pharmasia%20News/2013/ February/Clinical%20Trials%20Compensation%20Guidelines.pdf" id="6">(6)</a> or national versions thereof. This relieves the participant of the burden of proving negligence on the part of the investigator or sponsor to win the award of compensation. Thus, the mere occurrence of a trial-related injury or death, regardless of whether or not it is the fault of the sponsor or investigator, will trigger a pay-out. However, the quantum of compensation and actual pay-out are ultimately dependent upon the discretion of the insurance company. In some instances, should the parties disagree on the quantum, the insurance contract sometimes provides for a mediation process.

				<h5>India published its GCP in 2001 <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, Directorate General of Health Services, India. Good Clinical Practices for Clinical Research in India. Good Clinical Practices: Guidelines for Clinical Trials on Pharmaceutical Products in India [Internet]. New Delhi: CDSCO; 2001 [cited 2013 May 19]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/gcp1.html" id="7">(7)</a>. Paragraph 2.4.7 of the GCP Guidelines governs compensation for accidental injury and states:</h5>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Research subjects who suffer physical injury as a result
						of their participation in the Clinical Trial are entitled
						to financial or other assistance to compensate them
						equitably for any temporary or permanent impairment or
						disability subject to confirmation from IEC. In case of death,
						their dependants are entitled to material compensation.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h5>Paragraph 2.4.7.1 also obliges sponsors to pay compensation in
				instances of trial-related injury or death. It states:</h5>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						The sponsor, whether a pharmaceutical company, a
						government, or an institution, should agree, before the
						research begins, to provide compensation for any serious
						physical or mental injury for which subjects are entitled to
						compensation or agree to provide insurance coverage for
						an unforeseen injury whenever possible.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					These provisions did not prevent the apparent systemic nonpayment of trial-related compensation by Indian trial sponsors
					and/or their insurance companies <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mukherjee S. Compensation conundrum. Perspect Clin Res[Internet]. 2012 Jan-Mar [cited 2013 May 19];3(1):4-7. doi: 10.4103/2229-3485.92300PMCID: PMC3275993. Available from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/" id="8">(8)</a>, which highlights that the country's GCP Guidelines were inadequate to protect the interests of participants in clinical trials. The codification of a compensation process for clinical trials amounts to the removal of the discretionary power of trial sponsors and/or their insurance companies to stipulate the terms and conditions of coverage and to determine the quantum.
				</p>
				<p>
					India's new regulations entitle injured clinical subjects to
					"free medical management as long as required," as well as financial compensation "over and above any expenses incurred on the medical management of the subject." While this is a welcome measure, it is not clear if the latter compensation is for the time spent on, inconvenience associated with and reimbursable expenses (such as transport costs) related to the patient's medical management and/or for the pain, suffering and mental anguish experienced by the participant in the trial or the surviving next of kin (if applicable). The authorities should clarify this issue so that the participants in trials (and sponsors) know the scope of the potential study-related claims, especially since proving that such a claim exists or determining the quantum of compensation in the case of nonreimbursable claims (such as pain and suffering) generally
					requires the testimony of expert witnesses and other evidence.
					If such matters are not governed by the regulations, the injured
					parties or the next of kin of the deceased participants will have
					to institute such claims through civil proceedings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problematic feature of India's new regulations is that
					they leave the determination of the quantum of compensation
					to the discretion of research ethics committees (RECs) and an
					"independent expert committee" (IEC) constituted under the auspices of the licensing authority. The regulations require
					the governing REC to forward its opinion on compensation (if
					applicable) to an IEC, whose mandate includes determining
					the quantum of compensation to be paid out. Traditionally,
					such determination has been the domain of judicial officers
					well-versed in civil law and in determining the quantum of
					compensation to be awarded, and not of multidisciplinary
					RECs or IECs (unless such bodies are to be trained in/ staffed
					by judicial officers or legal experts skilled in the determination of the quantum of compensation). Given the already
					overburdened state of most RECs, it is not clear how the
					onerous task of forwarding quantum-related opinions will
					influence their turn-around times and what impact it will have
					on their staff turnover.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					India's attempt to regulate the issue of compensation for
					injuries and deaths arising from clinical trials is laudable,
					given the years of indifference on this subject. However,
					in their current form, the regulations are deficient and counterproductive and thus, merit urgent reconsideration. As
					they stand, they will dissuade sponsors and investigators from
					engaging in clinical trial activities. Without such sponsorship,
					the gaps in knowledge in the area of health will persist, and
					sub-optimal practice and policy will continue to cause suffering
					to millions. This is counter to the interests of India's people, who need responsible health research governance and intensified
					research that is locally responsive.
