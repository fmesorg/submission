				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<!-- Note: Every paragraph will be wrapped in individual paragraph element -->
				<p>
					Inappropriate antibiotic use and resistance are major public   health challenges. Interventional strategies require ascertaining the   perceptions of major stakeholders and documenting the challenges to   changing practice. Towards this aim, a qualitative study was conducted   in Vellore, South India, using focus group discussions among doctors,   pharmacists and public. There were eight groups with six to eight   participants each. The themes explored were: understanding of   infections, antibiotics and resistance; practices and pressure driving   antibiotic use; and strategies for appropriate use. Data were   transcribed, analysed, verified and a summary prepared with salient   features and quotations.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was found that the public had minimal awareness of   resistance, antibiotics and infections. They wanted symptomatic relief.   Doctors reported prescribing antibiotics for perceived patient   expectations and quick recovery. Business concerns contributed to   antibiotics sales among pharmacists. Pharmaceutical industry incentives   and healthcare provider competition were the main ethical challenges.   Suggested interventional strategies by the participants included   creating public awareness, better healthcare provider communication,   improved diagnostic support, strict implementation of guidelines,   continuing education, and strengthening of regulations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perceived patient benefit, unrestricted autonomy and   business-cum-industry pressures are promoting inappropriate use of   antibiotics. Strategies improving responsible use will help preserve   their effectiveness, and provide distributive justice and benefit for   future generations.

				<h4>Method</h4>
				<!-- Note: Every paragraph will be wrapped in individual paragraph element -->
				<h5>Study design</h5>
				<p>
					A qualitative study using focus group discussions (FGD) was   conducted <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Krueger RA, Casey MA. Focus groups: a practical guide for applied Research. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; 2000. Pp 320" id="11">(11)</a>. This design was chosen to ascertain the stakeholders'   awareness, obtain perspectives and explore the ethical dilemmas faced.
				</p>

				<h5>Setting</h5>
				<p>
					This study was conducted in urban and rural areas of Vellore   district in the state of Tamil Nadu, South India. This district has a   literacy of 72% and agriculture is the main occupation, making it   similar to the national profile <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="District Administration, Vellore. District Profile[Internet]. Vellore: Government of Tamil Nadu[date unknown]cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from: http://www.vellore.tn.nic.in/distprof.html" id="12">(12)</a>. Vellore town (urban area) is the   district headquarters with government and private hospitals, private   general practice (GP) clinics and numerous pharmacy shops. KV Kuppam   (rural area) is a development block with primary health centres, a   not-for-profit hospital, a few GP clinics and pharmacy shops. Patients   in both areas access healthcare mainly through allopathic facilities.   Indian systems of medicine (ISM) such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and   Naturopathy are also utilised through individual practitioners.
				</p>

				<h5>Participants and sampling</h5>
				<p>
					The main stakeholders in human antibiotic use are healthcare   providers and consumers. A total of eight focus groups were chosen to   represent these stakeholders. They included two groups each (urban and   rural) from among doctors, pharmacists, higher socioeconomic public   (HSEP) and lower socioeconomic public (LSEP) (Table 1). HSEP consisted   of teachers and housewives. LSEP consisted of relatives of patients   attending hospitals catering to the poor. There were six to eight   participants in each group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participant recruitment was through purposive sampling to obtain   diversity of opinion. Providers were doctors mainly in private practice   and hospitals, and pharmacists owning or attending pharmacy shops. Open   invitations were given to these healthcare providers through their   respective associations. Among those who came for the open meeting,   participants were chosen based on their willingness and ability to   commit time for the FGD. Consumers were representatives of civil society   (public) from different strata. Open invitations were given through   community forums, schools and health facility notice boards to attend a   public meeting. The study purpose was introduced in this meeting. Those   who expressed interest in joining the group discussions and were able to   commit time were included.
				</p>

				<h5>Procedure</h5>
				<p>
					Before starting, each group chose either Tamil (the local   language) or English as the medium for discussion. For the four FGDs   held in English, three of the authors (EM, ARF and SJC) were moderators.   For the four FGDs in Tamil, the moderators were colleagues who were   conversant with the language. All the moderators underwent training in   FGD from a social scientist and moderated pilot groups for   standardisation of technique. Each FGD was arranged at times convenient   to and venues easily accessible to the participants. The study purpose   and process were explained, and confidentiality issues discussed.   Written informed consent was obtained from participants after allowing   them sufficient time to understand the purpose and process of the study.   Following introductions, the moderator communicated the objectives of   the discussion. The moderator used a semi-structured discussion guide   with predefined themes. This allowed continuity of discussion, an   element of uniformity among groups, increased efficiency of data   comparison and a broad platform of information. The themes explored   were: (i) awareness and knowledge of infections and antibiotics; (ii)   knowledge and understanding of resistance; (iii) patterns and practices   in antibiotic use, and treatment preferences among healthcare providers;   (iv) reasons, pressures and incentives for high antibiotic use; and (v)   strategies to encourage appropriate antibiotic use. Each group   continued discussing for up to two hours until all the themes were   covered and no new information generated. A sociogram was maintained to   ensure the active participation of all. Notes and audio recordings of   each discussion by the note taker aided in collecting data   comprehensively, increased transparency of process, and allowed for an   audit trail.
				</p>

				<h5>Analysis</h5>
				<p>
					Transcription and translation of each FGD was done verbatim. Translation of Tamil into English was checked through back-translation   and its reliability confirmed. A validated method involving content   analysis with predefined themes was used <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Krueger RA, Casey MA. Focus groups: a practical guide for applied Research. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; 2000. Pp 320." id="11">(11)</a>. Transcripts were colour   coded to ensure that relevant data were ascribed to specific groups.   Tone and nonverbal communication was assessed through field notes. Study   group members reviewed transcripts individually, met to compare   segments of transcribed text, and reached consensus about their   interpretation. Patterns, regularities and trends relating to the   predefined themes were noted and verified. Data were summarised with   salient features and quotations. Quotations were chosen which best   represented the opinions of stakeholders. Follow-up workshops with   participants were held, wherein results were presented and discussed.   These also helped in the prioritisation of feasible interventional   strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Christian Medical College, Vellore (EC 8/04).

				<h4>Findings</h4>
				<!-- Note: Every paragraph will be wrapped in individual paragraph element -->

				<p>
					The findings are categorised based on predefined themes and reinforced with relevant stakeholder quotations. Explanations by the authors are mentioned in square brackets.
				</p>
				<h5>Theme 1: Awareness and knowledge of infections and antibiotics</h5>
				<p>
					Awareness was generally poor among LSEP about infections, their   causes, types and treatment. Participants did not mention antibiotics by   name, but they were able to physically identify some.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"If we take Metacin</em> [paracetamol], <em>fever comes down. But this tablet</em> [antibiotic displayed] <em>is better than Metacin."</em> Rural LSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					HSEP had basic knowledge about infections, could name some   antibiotics, and felt that only certain infections needed antibiotics.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"My understanding of antibiotic is that it stops bacteria growing in body...I think amoxycillin is for throat infection."</em> Urban HSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors were well versed in infections and antibiotics, but needed   continuing education updates. They were of the opinion that the   public's knowledge was poor.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"People know about Analgin</em> [metamizole], <em>Aspirin </em>[acetylsalicylic acid], <em>but not about antibiotics."</em> Rural doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					Pharmacists had some knowledge of infections and antibiotic types but little awareness of dosing guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Amoxycillin, 6 tablets is to be taken</em> [for full course]<em>."</em> Rural pharmacist
				</p>

				<h5>Theme 2: Knowledge and understanding of resistance</h5>
				<p>
					Doctors were knowledgeable about resistance and its consequences   and understood its relationship to antibiotic misuse. Many felt the   problem was restricted to hospitals, and were unaware that community   resistance was high.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Every time we give new antibiotics, the organisms mould accordingly."</em> Rural doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					Urban pharmacists had a fair knowledge of resistance. Their rural counterparts exhibited little concern for the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Patient's resistance power towards diseases will decrease. After sometime, no antibiotic will work."</em> Urban pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Not come across such patients; these are things for doctors"</em> Rural pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall the public had minimal awareness of antibiotic resistance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Sometimes, resistance happens to us. We go back to doctor with same problem. Then doctor changes medicines."</em> Rural LSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					HSEP of the urban area had a better understanding of antibiotic resistance compared with rural HSEP.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"They don't complete the course. From my little knowledge, this creates resistance."</em> Urban HSEP
				</p>

				<h5>Theme 3: Patterns, practices and preferences</h5>
				<p>
					Doctors made the following observations about antibiotic use   practices: Common, inexpensive antibiotics were prescribed in government   hospitals and costlier, newer antibiotics in private practice. The full   course of antibiotics was not prescribed. Patients could not afford the   full course, or would stop the antibiotic after getting relief. Many   patients visited quacks (unqualified practitioners) and pharmacists   directly for antibiotics.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"More than 50% need antibiotics."</em> Rural doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Nobody completes the course. If you write 20, they take five."</em> Urban doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Quacks come on bicycles in mornings and afternoons, see patients for five rupees and give medicines."</em> Rural doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					Pharmacists initially denied dispensing antibiotics without   prescription. On further probing, they admitted to doing so,   rationalising that cure was impossible without antibiotics. Antibiotics,   including amoxycillin, co-trimoxazole and combination antibiotics were   dispensed for common colds and symptoms suggestive of viral infection.   Often inadequate doses were dispensed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We are giving antibiotics to more than 75% of patients. Even for common cold, we prescribe two tablets of Septran</em> [co-trimoxazole]<em>"</em> Rural pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We give antibiotics for only one day...If doctors write 250mg   of erythromycin for children, we ask parents to buy half the dose"</em> Urban pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					LSEP generally visited allopathic doctors only if they really   needed to do so. Long distances and nonavailability of doctors during   the nights in rural area, and doctor fees and investigation charges in   urban areas were mentioned as reasons why patients resorted to   self-medication and visiting pharmacy shops. Antibiotics were given for   common symptoms such as cold, fever and body ache. Patients said doctors   did not explain the medicines or their side effects to them. They also   tended to stop antibiotics once the symptoms subsided.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"When they prescribe costly tablets, say for 100 rupees, we buy only half."</em> Rural LSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"If I have money I go to hospital. If not, I get medicine from pharmacy shop. If I get better, I stop and keep for future use"</em> Urban LSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					HSEP visited doctors for illnesses requiring diagnosis, but   visited pharmacy shops for immediate needs and to save time. Faster   recovery and preventing prolonged illness were reasons given for   antibiotic use.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"If I know about the illness and feel I can manage, I go to pharmacy shop. If I have a doubt, I go to doctor."</em> Rural HSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"To see a doctor, we take leave, stand in queue. Finally doctor   will prescribe, possibly the same drug. So we go to pharmacy shop."</em> Urban HSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					All public groups mentioned visiting ISM practitioners. Adverse   effects with allopathic medicines, previous positive experiences with   ISM, and perceived advantages of ISM in certain health conditions   encouraged ISM use.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"For dysentery we have separate native treatment. Allopathic medicines have side effects."</em> Rural HSEP
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Wherever they get chicken pox, they go to Alanthur [native medicine centre]. If they go there, they recover."</em> Rural LSEP
				</p>

				<h5>Theme 4: Reasons, pressures and incentives for high antibiotic use </h5>
				<p>
					Doctors blamed unqualified practitioners and pharmacy shops for   high antibiotic use claiming that antibiotics were given without proper   diagnosis and prescription.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Quacks provide 40 %</em> [percentage of antibiotics used], <em>medical shops 30%, doctors 30%."</em> Rural doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					On detailed probing, doctors admitted to high antibiotic   prescribing, attributing it to: (i) inadequate diagnostic facilities;   (ii) lack of antibiotic guidelines; (iii) difficulty in observing   patient progress; (iv) poor intensive care facilities in rural areas;   (v) patient demand for quick relief, and (vi) perceived patient   expectation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"If we ask for investigations on first day, patient never turns   up again. We immediately give antibiotics and watch for two days.   Nobody bothers about diagnosis, only symptom relief."</em> Urban, doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We are compelled to give drugs. Sometimes they dictate to us! They have pre-conceived ideas."</em> Urban doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors admitted that pharmaceutical companies put pressure on   them by introducing newer brands. Decisions and antibiotic choice were   influenced by incentives.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Even reputed companies offer complimentaries. If you prescribe   more, they offer air conditioned car or free tickets.... Of late, we   are forced to try new antibiotics"</em> Urban doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					Pharmacists initially blamed doctors for high antibiotic   prescriptions due to industry pressure. On probing, they admitted to   receiving incentives from companies to achieve sale targets.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Usually company representatives approach doctors. Certain companies give us extra strips of tablets as gifts."</em> Rural pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					On detailed probing pharmacists admitted to selling antibiotics,   stating that this was necessary because of: (i) patient demand; (ii) a   belief that cure is through antibiotics; (iii) competition from other   pharmacy shops, and (iv) antibiotic sales promoting business.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We cannot avoid antibiotics at time of necessity."</em> Rural pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Nobody likes to lose business. We give whatever they ask.   Competition, location of shops, license issues...everything has become   commercialised."</em> Urban pharmacist
				</p>

				<h5>Theme 5: Strategies for appropriate antibiotic use</h5>
				<p>
					The main suggestion by doctors was to improve public awareness of  infections to reduce antibiotic demand. Other strategies suggested were:   (i) law enforcement for antibiotic sales by prescription only; (ii)   improved laboratory facilities to differentiate viral and bacterial   infections; (iii) development of antibiotic guidelines; (iv) continuing   medical education; (v) development of a rational use module in the   medical curriculum, and (vi) a ban on unqualified health practitioners.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"For this, you have to enforce law, avoid free availability, check legal status of pharmacy shop and eradicate quacks!"</em> Urban doctor
				</p>
				<p>
					The pharmacists were more reticent, saying that doctors were   primarily responsible for antibiotic use. They however suggested the   following: (i) restriction of higher potency antibiotics through   prescriptions; (ii) continuing pharmacy education; (iii) inclusion of   modules on rational use in the pharmacy curriculum, and (iv) public   awareness programmes through the media.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"If doctors have intention, this problem can be reduced. Pharmacists are only like the arrow which has to be shot from the bow."</em> Urban pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We have to bring change at every level. This can be telecast on TV or newspaper and awareness created."</em> Urban pharmacist
				</p>
				<p>
					Public groups expressed concern that awareness of antibiotic   resistance was poor in comparison to problems like AIDS. They shared the   view that the primary strategy should focus on improving awareness   through mass education possibly starting at school level. Children were   receptive to new ideas and could influence parents. Other strategies   suggested were: (i) better explanation by doctors about health and   disease; (ii) improved communication from providers about antibiotics;   (iii) improved awareness through self help, women's groups and the   media, and (iv) implementation of laws for appropriate use of   antibiotics.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Awareness should start from schools. Teachers can spread   awareness." "Doctors should explain to patients the problems related   with antibiotic use. Even uneducated will understand if explained   properly."</em> Urban HSEP
				</p>

				<h4>Challenges and ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					The challenges relating to inappropriate antibiotic use raised both subtle and overt ethical issues. These are summarised below:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Limited awareness among the public about infections,   antibiotics, resistance and inadequate information from healthcare   providers. This compromises an individual's autonomy, and the right to   participate in decisions affecting their own welfare.
					</li>
					<li>
						Varying knowledge of antibiotics and resistance among healthcare   providers and limited continuing education. Patient beneficence and   responsible caring may be compromised if professional competence and   knowledge updates are lacking.
					</li>
					<li>
						Limited access to healthcare encouraging purchase of OTC   antibiotics through pharmacy shops and unqualified practitioners.   Inequities in access coupled with lax implementation of regulations   requiring antibiotic prescriptions contribute to irresponsible use.
					</li>
					<li>
						Patient demand and perceived need for quick relief promoting   inappropriate antibiotic use in non-bacterial conditions. Immediate   perceived individual benefit masks long-term societal risk through   resistance and its consequences.
					</li>
					<li>
						Non-compliance with standard antibiotic guidelines among   providers and consumers. Poor guideline adherence increases medication   risks and decreases antibiotic benefit through wrong choice and dosing   by the provider.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inadequate diagnostic support in many healthcare facilities   necessitating "just in case" antibiotic prescriptions. Inequities in   healthcare infrastructure and laboratory support coupled with   non-compliance to accreditation standards compromise responsible use.
					</li>
					<li>
						Older and cheaper antibiotics are becoming ineffective due to   rising resistance, leaving available the newer and costlier antibiotics   which are more effective. The affordability barrier constrains access to   these effective antibiotics thereby promoting health inequity.
					</li>
					<li>
						High competition and business pressures among healthcare   providers leading to antibiotic overuse. Provider benefit, irresponsible   use and commercialisation of healthcare is compromising evidence-based   and ethical healthcare.
					</li>
					<li>
						Undue pressures on healthcare providers for increased antibiotic   use and costlier brands through unlimited incentives by the   pharmaceutical industry. Healthcare providers are community leaders and   therefore need to resist such pressures which may increase inappropriate   use.
					</li>
					<li>
						Poor implementation of regulations, guidelines and law regarding   appropriate antibiotic use. Enforcement will strengthen responsible use   of antibiotics.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Knowledge and understanding of infections, antibiotics and resistance</h4>

				<p>
					In our study, awareness among the public about infections,   antibiotics and their indications was minimal. There is limited   awareness among other LMIC and some HIC too. A study from HIC revealed   that some people believe antibiotics cure colds, and have poor knowledge   of the treatment of bacterial and viral illnesses <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="AndrÃ© M, Vernby A, Berg J, Lundborg CS. A survey of public knowledge and awareness related to antibiotic use and resistance in Sweden. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jun;65(6):1292-6." id="14">(14)</a>. A study in LMIC   revealed a strong culture of self medication and some knowledge about   antibiotics <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hoa NQ, Ohman A, Lundborg CS, Chuc NT. Drug use and health-seeking behaviour for childhood illness in Vietnam-a qualitative study. Health Policy. 2007 Aug;82(3):320-9." id="15">(15)</a>. These findings suggest the urgent need for creating   greater public awareness about health, illness, hygiene and antibiotic   indications. It is important that healthcare providers effectively   communicate with their patients, so that this improves treatment   compliance and health outcomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our study, knowledge of antibiotic resistance was reasonable   among doctors, but low in priority. In other countries too, many   physicians recognised antibiotic resistance as a national problem,   rather than a problem in their own hospitals <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Wester CW, Durairaj L, Evans AT, Schwartz DN, Husain S, Martinez E. Antibiotic resistance: a survey of physician perceptions. Arch Intern Med. 2002 Oct 28;162(19):2210-6." id="16">(16)</a>. For many physicians,   concerns about patient care and uncertainty about managing infections   were a higher priority than antibiotic resistance issues <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Bjorkman I, Berg J, Roing M, Erntell M, Lundborg CS. Perceptions among Swedish hospital physicians on prescribing of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Qual Saf Health Care. 2010 Dec;19(6):e8." id="17">(17) </a>. Similar   to the findings in our study, pharmacists in other LMIC also revealed   poor knowledge of resistance <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hounsa A, De Mol P. Knowledge and perceptions of staff working in private dispensaries in Abidjan as regards bacterial resistance. Ann Pharm Fr. 2009 Jul;67(4):284-90." id="18">(18)</a>. This factor may be promoting higher   antibiotic use as suggested by another Indian study <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="S KI, Chandy SJ, Jeyaseelan L, Kumar R, Suresh S. Antimicrobial prescription patterns for common acute infections in some rural and urban health facilities of India. Indian J Med Res. 2008 Aug;128(2): 165-71." id="7">(7)</a>. In our study,   the public also had a poor understanding regarding antibiotic   resistance. Media coverage of antibiotic resistance and its implications   is negligible in comparison to issues such as AIDS and smoking. Lack of   awareness of the public regarding antibiotics and resistance was   revealed by both healthcare providers and consumers in our study. This   indicates the need for urgent interventions to improve awareness.

				<h4>Patterns, practices and preferences relating to antibiotic use</h4>

				<p>
					Infections are widely prevalent in India <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Integrated Diseases Surveillance Project [Internet]. New Delhi: MoHFW;2004[cited Nov 24]. Available from: http://www.idsp.nic.in/" id="13">(13)</a>. Bacterial infections which need antibiotics form only a small proportion. In our study though, doctors felt more than 50% of patients received   antibiotics. This should raise an alarm. Our findings were supported by a Chinese study which found that antibiotics were given for predominantly viral conditions such as diarrhoea and cough <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Reynolds L, McKee M. Factors influencing antibiotic prescribing in China. An exploratory analysis. Health Policy. 2009 Apr;90(1):32-6." id="19">(19)</a>. The wide range of antibiotics and brands available in the Indian market may increase the temptation to prescribe these medicines. The National List of Essential   Medicines (NLEM) contains only 21 antibiotics and two combinations,   co-trimoxazole and co-amoxiclav <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, National List of Essential Medicines of India. 2011[Internet]. New Delhi: MoHFW; 2011[cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from: http://pharmaceuticals.gov.in/NLEM.pdf" id="20">(20) </a>. The Indian market however offers more than 10,000 formulations, many of which are irrational combinations <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brand names and generic equivalents with price details[Internet]. Chennai: Med India Network for Health; 2012 [cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from: http://www.medindia.net/drug-price/index.asp." id="21">(21)</a>. Such a spread may create confusion between brand and generic names, quality and price variability. There may be pressure to sell higher margin brands. Affordability is also a concern. Buying an   antibiotic course for Rs 100 is approximately two days' average daily earnings for a casual worker in India <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India, Ministry of Labour and Employment. Annual report to the people on employment. 2010 Jul 1. Table 5: Average daily wages/earnings (Rs) across social groups in India, 2004-05[Internet]. New Delhi: MoLE, 2010[cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from:http://labour.nic.in/Report_to_People.pdf" id="22">(22)</a>, a major factor that prevents   them from purchasing a full course.
				</p>
				<p>
					The practice of purchasing antibiotics directly from pharmacy shops apparently to avoid spending extra time and money for consulting doctors is worrying. OTC antibiotic sales are not permitted in HIC whereas studies in countries such as Tanzania have demonstrated that   patients with cough, diarrhoea and other complaints were dispensed OTC antibiotics <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Viberg N, Kalala W, Mujinja P, Tomson G, Lundborg CS. &quot;Practical knowledge&quot; and perceptions of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among drugsellers in Tanzanian private drugstores. BMC Infect Dis. 2010 Sep 16;10:270." id="23">(23)</a>. Patient demand and lack of guidelines and updates echoed in our findings too. Ignorance of pharmacists about the dose of antibiotics, particularly the newer ones, indicates the need for continuing education. Antibiotic prescribing and dispensing practice should conform to scientific evidence and ethical norms. In India, many pharmacy shops are attended by untrained personnel and have only one   qualified pharmacist. This could be a major factor leading to errors in dispensing of medicines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another issue raised by doctors was that of unqualified practitioners and ISM practitioners prescribing antibiotics when in fact they were not qualified to do so. This issue deserves serious attention and clear policies are needed to designate eligible prescribers. There is no doubt that quacks should not prescribe antibiotics. However, the debate continues about whether ISM practitioners should prescribe allopathic medicines. In some states, members of Ayurveda,Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) are permitted to prescribe allopathic drugs. Inother states, this is restricted to emergency cases only <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh A. AYUSH for integrating allopathy with Indian systems of medicine. The Statesman[Internet]; Perspective:2012 Jun 21[cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from: http://www.thestatesman.net" id="24">(24)</a>.

				<h4>Reasons, pressures and incentives for antibiotic use</h4>

				<p>
					Perceived patient expectation was a reason for high antibiotic use in our study. Doctors claimed inadequate diagnostic facilities and patient demand as justification for prescribing antibiotics.Interestingly, GPs in the UK think prescribing antibiotics is part of   their social responsibility <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wood F, Simpson S, Butler CC. Socially responsible antibiotic choices in primary care: a qualitative study of GPs' decisions to prescribe broad-spectrum and fluroquinolone antibiotics. Fam Pract. 2007 Oct;24(5):427-34." id="25">(25)</a>. In contrast, a Swedish study showed the public trusted doctors more when antibiotics were not prescribed <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="AndrÃƒÂ© M, Vernby A, Berg J, Lundborg CS. A survey of public knowledge and awareness related to antibiotic use and resistance in Sweden. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2010 Jun;65(6):1292-6." id="1f">(14)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The perception of pharmacists in the study that doctors receive major incentives for antibiotic prescriptions was supported by a study from Orissa <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sahoo KC, Tamhankar AJ, Johansson E, Lundborg CS. Antibiotic use, resistance development and environmental factors: a qualitative study among healthcare professionals in Orissa, India. BMC Public Health. 2010 Oct 21;10:629." id="10">(10)</a>. Pharmacists however stated that OTC demand, business   competition and incentives were major drivers of antibiotic use. An ethnographic study done on pharmaceutical behaviour revealed reciprocal relationships between pharmacy shops, wholesale distributors and the pharmaceutical industry <a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kamat VR, Nichter M. Pharmacies, self-medication and pharmaceutical marketing in Bombay, India. Soc Sci Med. 1998 Sep;47(6):779-94." id="26">(26)</a>. Many pharmacists in our study viewed their profession as a business. This attitude will be difficult to change as livelihoods are often at stake.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fear, among GPs, of losing patients, and competition between pharmacy shops were mentioned as factors that were perceived to increase antibiotic prescribing and dispensing. This pressure could be minimised through policies and systems that allocate patients into health provider registries based on geographical area of stay.Patients could then visit allocated GP clinics and get medicines dispensed from adjacent pharmacy shops. This may improve relationships and communication between patients, doctors and pharmacists. This system is prevalent in the UK, where patients are assigned to GP practice groups,   with patients being allowed a change of GPs based on their needs <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department of Health, United Kingdom. Choice of GP practice: The Patient Choice Scheme[Internet]. UK: Department of Health; 2012 April 30[cited 2012 Nov 24].

				<h4>Strategies to contain antibiotic use</h4>
				<p>
					Among various strategies mentioned, one key suggestion was that of empowering the public through education and media. An interventional study has shown that an empowerment technique using leaflets and posters improves awareness of antibiotics and generates relevant questions to doctors <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Altiner A, Brockmann S, Sielk M, Wilm S, Wegscheider K, Abholz HH. Reducing antibiotic prescriptions for acute cough by motivating GPs to change their attitudes to communication and empowering patients: a cluster-randomized intervention study. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2007 Sep;60(3):638-44." id="28">(28)</a>. Stakeholders in our study supported the idea that school children, teachers, women's and self-help groups could be key partners in the process. Improved patient communication from healthcare providers about illness and antibiotics was another suggestion. Studies have   shown that interventions for improving patient communication reduce   antibiotic prescription rates by 60% <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Altiner A, Brockmann S, Sielk M, Wilm S, Wegscheider K, Abholz HH. Reducing antibiotic prescriptions for acute cough by motivating GPs to change their attitudes to communication and empowering patients: a cluster-randomized intervention study. J Antimicrob Chemother. 2007 Sep;60(3):638-44." id="28">(28)</a>. Developing guidelines for antibiotic use, continuing education programmes and rational use modules in healthcare curricula were other suggestions by healthcare providers in our study. Implementing such programmes could improve prescribing and dispensing practices, restrict irrational prescriptions and contain OTC sales.
				</p>
				<p>
					Strengthening the legal requirements for antibiotic prescriptions and prescriber eligibility, and prevention of antibiotic sales by quacks was suggested by stakeholders. Audit and feedback systems through antibiotic use surveillance would help to improve responsible use and   evaluate the success of strategies implemented.

				<h4>Challenges and ethical dilemmas</h4>
				<p>
					The factors contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use and resistance intertwine with major ethical principles. In this context, autonomy has two sides. On the one hand, patient autonomy is compromised, as poor awareness about infections, antibiotics and resistance minimise patients' participation in treatment decisions. On the other, the public enjoys autonomy to choose healthcare providers and often too much freedom to access OTC antibiotics from pharmacy shops and unqualified practitioners. This creates a major risk to health. This risk is compounded by variable factors in LMIC such as the poor quality of drugs <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bate R, Tren R, Mooney L, Hess K, Mitra B, Debroy B, Attaran A. Pilot study of essential drug quality in two major cities in India [Internet]. PLoS One. 2009 Jun 23[cited 2012 Nov 24];4(6):e6003." id="29">(29)</a>, unsatisfactory storage conditions of antibiotics, potential medication errors, and improper diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The risks and benefits of prescribing antibiotics are also worth debating. It is often a case of access versus excess. Underuse of antibiotics due to poor access can prolong illness, increase potential for infection transmission and complications from untreated infection, thereby increasing cost through hospitalization and wages lost. Giving antibiotics may actually save lives especially in cases of severe bacterial infection. Conversely, as expressed by stakeholders, antibiotics were often given on patient demand, for symptomatic relief and often for mild non-bacterial conditions. This misuse of antibiotics will deplete government allocation for the medicines budget and lead to denial of antibiotic therapy for patients with severe infections who genuinely need antibiotics. Availability of better laboratory facilities may improve diagnosis and generate data on community resistance patterns that is essential for empirical antibiotic prescriptions. However, patient costs may increase. Inappropriate antibiotic use may also have other consequences. Antibiotics destroy normal protective bacteria in the gut (commensal flora) thereby allowing survival of pathogenic bacteria that may be resistant to many antibiotics <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Costelloe C, Metcalfe C, Lovering A, Mant D, Hay AD. Effect of antibiotic prescribing in primary care on antimicrobial resistance in individual patients: systematic review and metanalysis. BMJ. 2010 May 18;340:c2096. doi: 10.1136/bmj.c2096." id="4">(4)</a>. This may have grave consequences, with antibiotics subsequently becoming ineffective for serious infections. Resistant bacteria may also spread through unhygienic habits and conditions to others in the vicinity and community. Besides individual risk, high use of antibiotics may lead to rising community antibiotic resistance <a class="reference" href="#thirty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tello A, Austin B, Telfer TC. Selective pressure of antibiotic pollution on bacteria of importance to public health. Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Aug;120(8):1100-6." id="30">(30)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Justice demands that antibiotics be accessible and affordable, but   balanced by evidence-based therapy through healthcare providers. This principle is often compromised as revealed by our study, through pressures of competition between healthcare providers, business concerns, the powerful influence of the pharmaceutical industry and lax implementation of policies and law. Enforcing regulation to ensure antibiotics are sold only through prescriptions from qualified practitioners appears difficult to implement. This difficulty is compounded by OTC sales of antibiotics and prescription by unqualified practitioners, but is, on the other hand complicated by the need for access to life saving antibiotics and inaccessible healthcare in many rural areas. Control of narcotic drugs for healthcare in India is a shining example of good implementation of regulation, balancing control   and access <a class="reference" href="#thirtyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. 1985 September 16 [Internet]. New Delhi: GoI, 1985[cited 2012 Nov 24]. Available from: http://india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/2482.pdf" id="31">(31)</a>. It raises the hope that discipline is possible, and   that antibiotic availability through prescription alone is not just a   distant dream.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pharmaceutical incentives, business concerns and competition have one common thread: money. Tackling this needs a multipronged approach requiring the cooperation of all stakeholders. There is no easy solution; it needs the imbibing of professional values by healthcare providers, development of relevant professional guidelines, and a refinement of existing laws. The step by the Medical Council of India to ban practitioners from taking free gifts and the subsequent move by the Central Board of Direct Taxes to charge income tax on pharmaceutical industry gifts <em>are</em> encouraging <a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Finance, Income Tax Department. Circular No 5/2012. Inadmissibility of expenses incurred in providing freebees to medical practitioner by pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry[Internet]New Delhi: IT Department, 2012[cited 2013 Jan 2]. Available from: http://law.incometaxindia.gov.in/DIT/Circulars.aspx" id="32">(32)</a>. However practical   implementation on the ground remains to be seen. On the part of the   pharmaceutical industry, a more scientific and humanitarian concern to true public service and meeting the actual needs of society is the need of the hour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, the ethical issue is one of the individual versus society. In the case of antibiotic use and resistance, considering all that has been expressed by stakeholders, should autonomy and benefits to the individual get preference over the risks to society and   distributive justice for health? Individual antibiotic use must be appropriate and regulated. Otherwise the whole society is at risk with infections not responding to the prescribed antibiotics due to the phenomenon of resistance.

				<h4>Methodological considerations</h4>
				<p>
					The FGD methodology served its purpose in bringing out various views, attitudes, interactions, areas of consensus, and community practices. Supplementation with in-depth interviews could have strengthened information on sensitive issues. Purposive sampling helpedto select interested stakeholders. The public were stratified into HSEP and LSEP so that knowledge, attitudes and practices from diverse backgrounds could be explored. Participant numbers in groups were restricted for easier management and to provide participants more   opportunities for expressing their views. A follow-up workshop was conducted where the results were presented and the participants agreed to the authors' interpretation of their statements. This study looked at three major stakeholders. Other stakeholders ISM practitioners, the pharmaceutical industry, policy makers and antibiotic users in   agriculture and animal husbandry need inclusion in further studies.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					This study found that healthcare providers had a basic knowledge   of antibiotics and infections, whereas the public had little awareness. Antibiotic use for non-bacterial infections, inadequate dosages, non-compliance, and antibiotic sales directly from pharmacy shops and quacks were observed as common practices. Perceived patient expectation, immediate relief, inadequate diagnostic facilities, competition and   industry incentives contributed to irresponsible antibiotic use. Suggested remedial strategies dwelt on improving public awareness, better communication, improved diagnostic support, continuing education, and regulation enforcement. Empowering the public, curbing pharmaceutical industry incentives, and encouraging healthcare providers to have a scientific and professional approach, rather than a business approach,would address some of the major ethical challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					The autonomy to use antibiotics needs to be balanced against the risk of rising resistance and beneficial outcome with prudent antibiotic therapy. Interventional strategies need to emphasise improving appropriate and ethical use of antibiotics. This would help keep   effective antibiotics available for use and preserve this precious resource, not just for the present, but also for future generations.
