			<h3>Teaching ethics in an unethical setting: "doing nothing" is neither good nor right</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Subrata Chattopadhyay</h4>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Does it make sense to teach ethics in an unethical setting? Should
					teachers who work in morally compromised institutions make
					an effort to introduce biomedical ethics to the curriculum? Using
					the medical establishment in contemporary India as a window to
					understanding the challenge of teaching ethics in an unethical
					setting, this article attempts to discuss issues pertaining to ethics
					education in institutions with a weak ethical climate. Putting
					ethics into practice is the essence of ethics education and in
					this the integrity of the teacher and the moral environment of
					the institution play significant roles. The choice or decision to
					"do nothing" is not necessarily value neutral; rather, given the
					deteriorating ethos in medical establishments, it goes directly
					against the principles of "doing good" and "avoiding harm".
					Practitioners of the art of healing have a moral obligation to
					protect, uphold and nurture the cause of ethics in medicine.
					Teaching and learning ethics should be initiated-not pushed
					aside-even in unethical institutional settings.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Does it make sense to teach ethics in an unethical setting?
					Should one ignore or foster ethics in an unjust environment?
					Why bother about ethics or morality when the medical
					establishment does not care much about them?
					These are important questions for conscientious medical
					teachers and practitioners who work in morally compromised
					institutions. In an international meeting on bioethics, the
					issue of teaching bioethics in an unethical setting came
					up for informal discussion among participants from some
					Asian countries <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Macer DRJ. editor. Asia-Pacific Perspectives on Bioethics Education. RUSHSAP, UNESCO: Bangkok; 2008." id="1">(1)</a>. Of course, it would be nice to be engaged
					in ethics education if biomedical ethics was given due
					recognition and the moral environment of the institution was
					something to be proud of. Unfortunately, that is not the case
					at present in several countries, including India, where medical
					establishments often tarred by published reports of corruption
					neither encourage nor take pride in good ethical practices of
					medicine. Worse, they seem to have lost their moral compass
					<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK. Where is medical practice in India heading? Mens Sana Monographs. 2006 Oct; 4(1): 50-61." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chattopadhyay S. Black money in white coats: whither medical ethics? Indian J Med Ethics. 2008 Jan-Mar;5(1):20-21." id="3">3)</a>. In this complex web of unwelcome realities, even well
					meaning educators may be sceptical about the need to teach
					ethics. The problem is not about how to develop an ethics
					curriculum, because to develop an ethics curriculum may be
					challenging but it is certainly doable. So, what is so special
					about ethics education? Why does the teaching of ethics in
					an unethical setting appear to be so problematic? And, more
					importantly, what should be our vision in such a situation? This
					article delves into some concrete realities of the Indian scenario
					and attempts to address the question of why teaching and
					learning of ethics should be initiated-not pushed aside-in an
					unethical institutional setting.

				<h4>Medical ethics in contemporary India-betrayal of
				moral heritage</h4>
				<p>
					In ancient times, India had developed her own indigenous
					traditional system of medicine, Ayurveda, and had an elaborate
					code of medical ethics that surpassed the Hippocratic Oath
					in both "eloquence and moral idealism" <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jonsen AR. A short history of medical ethics. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 2000." id="4">(4)</a>. Modern western
					medicine was introduced into the Indian sub-continent in
					the early 19th century by the British colonialists <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao MS. The history of medicine in India and Burma. Med Hist. 1968;12:52-61." id="5">(5)</a>. For sociopolitical
					reasons, Ayurveda was segregated from modern
					western medicine during the British era and, significantly, that
					colonial legacy continued even after India's independence
					in 1947 <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Srinivasan P. National health policy for traditional medicine in India. World Health Forum.1995;16(2):190-3." id="6">(6)</a>. Notwithstanding considerable progress in socioeconomic
					conditions and the quality of healthcare facilities,
					gross disparity continues to exist in health status indices and in
					access to healthcare between rural and urban areas of India <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patil AV, Somasundaram KV, Goyal RC. Current health scenario in rural India. Aust J Rural Health. 2002 Apr;10(2):129-35." id="7">(7)</a>.
					With the private sector contributing 75% of the total health
					expenditure and a well-developed system of modern medicine
					in cosmopolitan cities, India has been a destination for "medical
					tourism" that is forecast to become a $2.3 billion business by 2012,
					while India's poor continue to suffer second-rate healthcare <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Portal of India.

				<p>
					For many Indian physicians, medicine is a vocation-a calling-to
					serve the needy and vulnerable in resource-poor settings,
					particularly in remote areas. The ethos of the Indian medical
					establishment, however, has changed for the worse in recent
					decades. Medicine, historically considered a noble profession,
					has become a moneymaking enterprise capitalising on
					human suffering. Sadly, reports of academic dishonesty, gross
					professional misconduct, moral decay and corruption are
					commonplace in Indian medicine <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chattopadhyay S. Black money in white coats: whither medical ethics?

					and professional organisations have not only failed to promote
					a culture of humane medicine, they lack moral vision, positive
					will, and effective mechanisms to regulate unethical practices
					in medicine which now fall under the purview of the Consumer
					Protection Act, 1986. The extent of moral degeneration and
					abuse of power can be gauged by the fact that the president of
					the Medical Council of India (MCI, the Indian equivalent of the
					General Medical Council, UK) was removed from his post by an
					order of the high court on charges of corruption <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma R.

					Few will disagree with the statement that the curriculum
					of Indian medical colleges is out of touch with the reality of
					healthcare needs of the Indian people. Bioethics is virtually
					non-existent in India, both as a subject of academic pursuit
					and as a platform for public debate on science and medicine.
					In the land that gave birth to the Vedas and Upanishads, there
					is no place for philosophy, spirituality, ethics, or the humanities
					in the medical curriculum. Thus, except for a very few religious
					minority institutions, medical students in India get almost no
					exposure to humanistic, philosophical or spiritual worldviews
					during medical education and training. For all practical
					purposes, ethics education in Indian medical colleges is limited
					to learning bedside manners and a few neglected lectures as
					part of medical jurisprudence.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics is not like differential calculus</h4>
				<p>
					Perhaps the first issue to address is the rationale behind the
					teaching of ethics: can ethics be taught? The philosopher
					Socrates argued in favour of teaching ethics. His argument
					was unequivocal: we need the knowledge of what we ought
					to do. Knowledge can be taught, thus the knowledge of what
					we ought to do - ethics - can also be taught. Buddha not only
					taught ethics to his disciples, but also inspired them to live
					ethics. For millennia, in the Indian sub-continent, the satguru or
					acharya (the master) gave lessons to their pupils in all spheres
					of life to live ethically. Since theories of moral development
					were formulated in the early part of the last century, educators
					mostly have agreed that ethics can be taught-maybe to
					varying extent-with moral development taking place in
					successive stages <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patenaude J, Niyonsenga T, Fafard D. Changes in students' moral development during medical school: a cohort study. CMAJ. 2003 Apr 1;168(7):840-4." id="12">(12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, is ethics like any other subject of study? In what
					ways is ethics different from other subjects? The teaching
					and learning of ethics has some unique characteristics that
					deserve thoughtful consideration. Morality is intertwined with
					what makes us human-moral development is not necessarily
					always related to formal school or college education. Thus, a
					person without any formal education may have sound moral
					judgements about right and wrong and live perfectly well as
					a moral person. The purpose of ethics education in healthcare
					institutions is to emphasise the moral nature of the art and
					science of medicine and sensitise the learner to ethical issues.
					Ethics is not something like, for example, differential calculus
					that one may learn in school or college only to forget it in later
					years while doing an office job. Moreover, learning the subject
					matter of ethics does not end in good grades in transcripts or
					college graduation; rather, the essence of learning ethics lies
					with ethical practice-being ethical-applying ethical reflection
					and analysis to deal with a myriad life issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third, who will be the preferred teachers in ethics education?
					Apart from the uniqueness of ethics as a discipline or field of
					study, the role of teachers in ethics education-either as role
					models or as mentors-seems to be of paramount importance.
					While attributes like conscience, integrity, and character of
					the teacher are undoubtedly important in education, these
					qualities are required for instruction of ethics. For example, it isdifficult to imagine that a teacher with a proven track record of
					unscrupulous activities can teach ethics. To teach ethics you need
					teachers who value and care for ethics in individual and collective
					life, practise ethics in their academic and professional worlds, and
					in a way act as role models or mentors for the learners.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The ethical climate and the hidden curriculum of the
				institution</h4>
				<p>
					What about the context in ethics instruction? Does the
					workplace-or, more specifically, its moral environment-play
					any role in the teaching and learning of ethics? If yes, how?
				</p>
				<p>
					Education is a human praxis and thus quite naturally ethics
					education takes place not in a vacuum but in the thick of
					concrete realities. Ethics curricula in healthcare professions
					may thus differ in aims and methodology of instruction,
					depending on context and needs <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eckles RE, Meslin EM, Gaffney M, Helft PR. Medical ethics education:where are we? Where should we be going? A review. Acad Med. 2005;80(12):1143-52." id="13">(13)</a>. The importance of the
					ethical climate of the institution can best be understood if we
					ask ourselves whether an ethics department can be funded by
					"black" money or patronised by an institution that is part of the
					illegal "kidney bazaar". I doubt it. It is very unlikely that future
					healthcare professionals will take a serious interest in ethical
					reflection and analysis if the workplace reflects such an immoral
					environment. Thus, the morally lax atmosphere of an institution
					would be a deterrent in learning ethical behaviour and practice.
					Educators have also drawn attention to a phenomenon called
					the "hidden curriculum" in which students learn more about
					acceptable and unacceptable behaviour from institutional
					arrangements and non-verbal cues in the classroom and on theward <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lempp H, Seale C. The hidden curriculum in undergraduate medical education: qualitative study of medical students' perceptions of teaching. BMJ. 2004 Oct 2;329(7469):770-3." id="14">(14)</a>. The hidden curriculum, more so in an institution of
					questionable moral integrity, may pose a serious challenge to
					ethics education. It is not surprising, therefore, that some wellmeaning
					teachers will be sceptical about the rationale behind
					instruction of ethics in an unethical institutional set-up. Does
					this mean that we should stop thinking and "do nothing" in so
					far as ethics education is concerned? Is doing nothing a morally
					sound choice?
				</p>
				<p>
					While the lack of attention to ethics education in India is
					understandable-after all, what good does it do to teach ethics
					in a setting marked by corrupt behaviour and injustice?-it
					is unjustified and a terrible mistake for medical educators
					to resign themselves to morally questionable practices in
					healthcare, for a number of reasons.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Doing nothing is an active decision of moral
				significance</h4>
				<p>
					The choice to do nothing is not necessarily a value-neutral one;
					it also has a moral dimension, more so when doing something
					is needed to do good and avoid harm. The apparently harmless
					position of doing nothing amidst an outbreak of an epidemic,
					is, in fact, doing something that kills human beings. Similarly,
					doing nothing when ethics in medicine is needed perhaps
					more than ever kills the moral nature of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics education, wherever it occurs, necessarily takes place in a
					less-than-ideal context, for there is no need for ethics educationin an ideal society, whatever that may mean. It is also true
					that the noble aspiration of medicine-to do good and serve
					human beings-influences the mental landscape of learners in
					myriad ways. Thus, an institution marked with moral integrity
					is certainly preferable, but not absolutely required, for teaching
					ethics in medicine. Further, the role of the hidden curriculum
					must be acknowledged, but need not be exaggerated, because
					in an unethical setting there may not be anything that is
					actually hidden.
				</p>
				<p>
					The choice of doing nothing is also unrealistic and impractical.
					It means-in reality-leaving things as they are in medical
					education and practice. On the face of it, this means that no
					educator would take any serious interest or initiative in ethics
					education and nobody would put the agenda of ethical values
					and principles on the table of academic medicine. In that
					scenario, either we will all be united in hopeless misery, or
					we will hope that things will get better in the future, without
					knowing how and why. The first option of endless darkness
					does not merit any comment. The second, more hopeful, option
					is wishful thinking, if not daydreaming, that our students will
					somehow be gifted with moral values and principles and they
					will simply be inspired to practise medicine ethically even in a
					morally compromised institution. It means that in the absence
					of any ethics education, our future healthcare professionals will
					value, appreciate, and learn ethics in medicine - presumably
					from nowhere and nobody.
				</p>
				<p>
					The future in that scenario, not very arguably, will be
					horrendous. With nothing to counterbalance the unethical
					tilt, and practically no agency to safeguard the moral premise
					of medicine within the profession, medical educators and
					practitioners will increasingly behave like merchants of
					immorality. Professors of medicine will stock black money,
					surgeons will be involved in organ trade, doctors will keep
					on taking kickbacks ("percentage" or "cut-money"), and yet,
					amidst all these medical maladies plaguing the profession, our
					students, the future healthcare professionals, will remain "pure
					in character" as promulgated by the MCI code of ethics <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India. Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations 2002. [cited 2009 Mar 16]. Available from: http://www.mciindia.org/know/rules/ethics.htm" id="15">(15)</a>. This
					kind of pure in character product, manufactured in the process
					of doing nothing, will perhaps increasingly appear in persons
					like the former head of the MCI who was stripped of his post
					for corruption. Doing nothing is potentially - no, not potentially
					but actually - the prescription for doom, crafted by inaction on
					our part and approved by the apathy of our medical council
					and professional associations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>There will be some who will understand</h4>
				<p>
					What is the point of telling people the noble truth when
					they seem not to care and are busy with mundane things?
					Faced with this question from Mara, the Evil, Buddha replied,
					"There will be some who will understand." The spirit of this
					powerful saying gives one endless hope. When a clinician
					starts managing a patient, there is hope that the patient will
					recover. Hope is something that keeps us moving when things
					are not all right. Historically, medicine is considered the art of
					healing and hope has justifiably been treated as a cardinalvirtue of medicine <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bryan CS. For goodness sake: the seven basic virtues. Columbia, SC: The Phrontistery Press; 2006." id="16">(16)</a>. The same is true for ethics education.
					No matter what the nature of ethics practised in an institution,
					the possibility always exists that there are people who are
					concerned about ethical lapses and who would like to see
					a change in the less-than-ideal ethical climate. The humble
					but spirited efforts of these conscientious physicians and
					educators may gain momentum and may make a difference
					to the ethos of medicine. These medical practitioners and
					educators may not necessarily articulate their thoughts and
					ideas in bioethical jargon like "deontology" or "utilitarianism",
					but they have the potential to pioneer a positive change in
					the moral environment of institutional medicine. This author is
					respectfully aware of a few medical teachers who did not draw
					black money as part of their salary, refused to fabricate patient
					records to "fool" the MCI inspectors, and declined the request
					of the management to pass unworthy students in professional
					examinations. Spirited and not inconsequential efforts by such
					people may go a long way in sensitising students to issues of
					ethical significance and pave the way for ethics education.
				</p>
				<p>
					Educators need not wait for significant structural change in
					the medical curriculum. They can use existing opportunities
					such as tutorials, seminars, journal clubs, and clinical grand
					rounds to touch upon important ethical issues in medicine
					and engage students in ethical reflection and analysis. For
					example, the problem of cheating in medical school can be
					raised for discussion with students. A basic science teacher can
					touch upon ethical issues arising out of biomedical research
					with stem cells. A pharmacologist can discuss ethical concerns
					with reference to drug trials. During clinical rounds, ethicalsocial-
					legal issues can be discussed along with clinical aspects
					of patient care. A specialist in critical care medicine may also
					engage students in discussions on ethical decision-making
					in end-of-life care. Neuroethics-the neural basis of ethical
					behaviour-may be on the agenda of seminars on recent
					advances in neurosciences. Organising and attending seminars,
					clinical meetings, and journal clubs gives an opportunity
					to raise important issues pertaining to ethics in medicine.
					In an unethical setting even a small number of committed
					individuals may thus function as the nucleus of a core group
					to further the ethics agenda. Many senior faculty members or
					those working in administrative posts can also walk the extra
					mile to put ethics back on the agenda of academic medicine.
					Sustained initiatives of this nature are likely to gain momentum in due course. The <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>, for example,
					can organise a platform for interaction and exchange of ideas
					among educators interested in ethics education. The National
					Bioethics Conference can formulate guidelines, set the
					framework and foundation of ethics education, and push for
					its inclusion as part of the medical curriculum. There are many
					possibilities we can explore once we are convinced that it is
					necessary to pursue ethics education in spite of, and amidst,
					unethical institutional settings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us not mince words. The point is-simply-small things also
					count, and what we do also matters. Whether one believes
					in the doctrine of Karma, or the western philosophy of
					consequentialism, the fruits of our thoughts, words, and actions
					are there in the short or long run, or both. As a profession
					intimately connected with life and death and with the wellbeing
					of individual and collective life, medicine is obliged to
					maintain its moral premise, to keep its allegiance to ethical
					values and principles both within and outside the profession,
					even within a morally challenged set-up. We have an obligation
					of a moral nature-to ourselves, our children and families, our
					society, our profession, our country-that needs to be fulfilled
					for the sake of everything near and dear to us and considered
					sacred in life. Without waiting fruitlessly and endlessly for a
					change in the deteriorating ethical climate of Indian medicine,
					conscientious educators need to go ahead and introduce ethics
					education, taking small steps at a time, because that is just the
					right thing to do. It is time to take the challenge head-on.
