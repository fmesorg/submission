					Lay people often wonder at all the fuss   about identifying the biological sex of an individual. They may recall a   granny or midwife, immediately after a delivery, even in the dim light,   declaring with ease that it's a girl, or a boy, to the rejoicing crowd   waiting eagerly outside the delivery room. When it is so simple, why are   doctors, sports administrators and investigators making such a hue and   cry about this? How do you identify the biological sex of an individual?   What is this fuss about sex verification tests? Are they the same as   gender verification tests? What are the ethical, legal and social   aspects of these sex verification tests? I will try to answer some of   these questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Tucker, 'Sex' is the biological term denoting the   genetic and anatomical characteristics of an individual, based on which   we can identify ourselves as 'males' and 'females'. 'Gender', on the   other hand, is a sociological construct that denotes how an individual   is identified according to social norms." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39.

Based on this, we could   say an individual exhibits 'masculine' or 'feminine' qualities. So when   we have to identify an individual as 'male' or 'female' the correct term   should be 'sex verification tests' and not 'gender verification tests'   as reported in the lay press as well as in some publications <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M.

					Routinely at birth, the 'external genitals' (phenotype sex),   whether they are the penis and scrotum (male), or vulva and vagina   (female), help in identifying the biological 'sex' of an individual. The   problem arises in cases of ambiguous genitalia wherein the external   genitals are a mixture of both sexes. In such cases the detection of   'internal gonads and sex chromosomes' (genotype sex), whether it is   testis and XY sex chromosomes (male) or ova and XX sex chromosomes   (female), solves the problem to a certain extent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In cases of hermaphrodites (natural) or in <em>hijras, zenanas</em> and transexuals (acquired) the external genitals  either (i) resemble   one sex while the internal gonads could be of the other sex (Klinefelter   syndrome, Turner syndrome); (ii) or are not of either sex (<em>hijras, zenanas</em>);   (iii) or are of both sexes (true hermaphrodite). There are problems in   the easy identification of biological sex in certain cases: some of   these are: sportspersons (like the Caster Semenya case <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wiesemann C. Is there a right not to know one's sex? The ethics of 'gender verification' in women's sports competition [abstract]. J Med Ethics [Internet]. 2011 [cited 2012 Dec 29]; 37:216-20. Available from: http://jme.bmj.com/content/37/4/216.abstract" id="3">(3)</a>,   pre-employment tests (as in the military), and in alleged crimes as in   the Pinki Pramanik case <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhan G. The right to our bodies. The Times of India [Internet]. 2012 Jul 9 [cited 2012 Dec 29]. Opinion: [about 4 screens]. Available from:. http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-09/edit-page/32589114_1_gender-identity-pinki-pramanik-gender-test" id="5">(5)</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Doubts are then cast on the people tested -- whether they   deliberately hid their real sex identity to gain an advantage in sports,   crime or in employment -- and they are forced to undergo  compulsory   sex verification tests. Is informed consent sought before these tests?   Are the limitations of these sex verification tests explained to the   individual? For instance, as in the Pinki Pramanik case, is informed   consent taken, citing Section 53 of The Code of Criminal Procedure,   1973, (Cr PC) regarding the medical examination of an accused in a   crime? Section 53 Cr P C allows the use of &ldquo;reasonable force" in   performing a medical examination. Still, are we being ethical when   performing such tests against the wish of the individual?    Identification of the 'sex' of an individual is complicated by (i) 'concealed sex' (eg cross dressing); (ii) 'intersex' (having features resembling both sexes &ndash; natural or acquired); (iii) 'transvestism' (cross dressing for sexual gratification); (iv) 'transexualism' (undergoing sex change surgeries), etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Official sex verification testing in sports dates back to 1960,   when the 'nude parading' of female competitors before a panel of judges   (female doctors) resulted in outrage and protest, and a high risk of   incorrect evaluation for the reasons explained above as in cases of   hermaphrodites and transexuals <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39. Available from: http://www.adas.org.rs/dokumenti/anado/2010.10.27/doping-The-science-of-sex-verification-and-athletic-performance-Tucker-2010.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. We cannot accept such tests which   blatantly violate the dignity and privacy of an individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1967, these tests were replaced by 'nuclear sexing or   microscopic tests or sex chromatin tests'. A buccal smear was done to   identify the presence of a Barr body. If Barr bodies were detected, in   cases of females (XX) then a certificate of 'femininity' was issued <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39. Available from: http://www.adas.org.rs/dokumenti/anado/2010.10.27/doping-The-science-of-sex-verification-and-athletic-performance-Tucker-2010.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>.   Thus in males (XY), possessing only one X chromosome would produce a   negative Barr body test. But this testing also had its problems in cases   of androgen insensitivity syndrome, -5-reductase deficiency, and in   Turner's syndrome. In all these cases though they are brought up as   females, they have genetically only one X chromosome and thus would   produce a negative Barr body test.
				</p>
				<p>
					These tests were replaced by the use of polymerase chain reaction   (PCR) for the detection of 'Y-linked SRY gene' (Sex-determining region   of the Y chromosome) <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39. Available from: http://www.adas.org.rs/dokumenti/anado/2010.10.27/doping-The-science-of-sex-verification-and-athletic-performance-Tucker-2010.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. The presence of this gene at five weeks of   intrauterine development on the Y chromosome helps in the development of   testes and production of testosterone. Although the PCR technique was   supposed to identify uniquely male DNA sequences, further investigation   revealed that it also yielded  false positive test results <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wiesemann C. Is there a right not to know one's sex? The ethics of 'gender verification' in women's sports competition [abstract]. J Med Ethics [Internet]. 2011 [cited 2012 Dec 29]; 37:216-20. Available from: http://jme.bmj.com/content/37/4/216.abstract" id="3">(3)</a>. Later on   a combination of all these tests including chromosomal studies and  hormonal assays was carried out to determine the 'sex' of the   individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the disorders of sex development androgen insensitivity syndrome, ?-5-reductase deficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, mosaicism always   pose a problem in sex verification tests because of the distinction   between chromosomal sex and anatomical sex of the individual. At five   weeks of intrauterine development with the presence of two X chromosomes   and the absence of the Y chromosome, the gonads develop into ovaries   with the resultant female development. When the Y chromosome is present,   the gonads are signaled to develop into testes, which produce   testosterone, and other male hormones, which ultimately result in the   development of male reproductive organs; and, at puberty, in the   development of secondary sexual characteristics such as increased   musculature and hair growth on the face, chest, underarms, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (more potent, produced by   enzyme -5-reductase) help in the development of primary and secondary   sexual characteristics and increased skeletal muscle mass. 'Androgen   insensitivity syndrome' is caused by receptors that are insensitive to   androgens, particularly testosterone. As a result, the individual,   though genetically male (XY) and possessing testes would fail to develop   male characteristics, appearing female with internal testes <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39. Available from: http://www.adas.org.rs/dokumenti/anado/2010.10.27/doping-The-science-of-sex-verification-and-athletic-performance-Tucker-2010.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>.These   individuals would develop as female but would fail the Barr body test as   they have only one X chromosome, as in the case of Maria Patino <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patino MJM. Personal account: A woman tried and tested. Lancet [Internet]. 2005 Dec 1 [cited 2012 Dec29]; 366:S38.

				</p>
				<p>
					In <em>-5-reductase deficiency syndrome</em> the hormone   dihydro-testosterone is not produced. As a result, individuals do not   develop male characteristics. For instance,  the penis  can resemble the   clitoris. Hence such individuals are often raised as girls. At puberty,   however their musculature develops, owing to normal levels of   testosterone <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39.

These individuals fail in external examination of   genitals and fail in Barr body testing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</em> is a condition wherein   adrenal glands produce excessive amounts of testosterone in  females.   These individuals can develop secondary male characteristics but are   genetically female (46, XX), lacking testes and male reproductive organs <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39.

These individuals fail in external examination of genitals but   would have positive Barr body test results (as they have two X   chromosomes).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Klinefelter syndrome</em> <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhuvaneshwari S. Identification. In: VV Pillay, editor. Textbook of forensic medicine and toxicology. 16th ed. Hyderabad: Paras Medical Publisher, 2011, p 52" id="7">(7)</a> is male hypogonadism, with two or   more X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes, the commonest   presentation being 47XXY karyotype; the characteristic features being a   eunuchoid body, long legs, gynaecomastia, small atrophic testes, small   penis and absence of secondary male sexual characteristics. These   individuals fail in external examination of genitals but would have   false positive Barr body testing (as they have two X chromosomes).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Turner syndrome</em> <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhuvaneshwari S. Identification. In: VV Pillay, editor. Textbook of forensic medicine and toxicology. 16th ed. Hyderabad: Paras Medical Publisher, 2011, p 52" id="7">(7)</a> is female hypogonadism with 45 XO   karyotype. Characteristics include short stature, low posterior   hairline, webbing of the neck, and a broad chest with widely spaced   nipples. These individuals fail in external examination of the genitals   and  have false negative Barr body test results, as they have one X   chromosome.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Mosaicism</em> is a genetic abnormality with a mixture of cells -    XX and XY, or X and XY sex chromosomes <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39.

Accordingly, individuals   with this condition may have false positive or false negative Barr body   test results, depending on number of X chromosomes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In sports, the compulsory testing of all female competitors (in an   effort to prevent male imposters) was banned in 1992. It was replaced   by a policy of testing only when there is suspicion or when somebody   challenges the sex of an individual. It was an absurdity  to test all   females when the real culprits were males posing as females. This   irrational compulsory testing continued for decades in this   male-dominated society. Today,  sports governing bodies have gone beyond   laboratory testing and  adopted more comprehensive medical evaluation   by a team of experts, including gynaecologists, endocrinologists,   internal medicine experts, geneticists, and experts on gender/   transgender issues <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M. The science of sex verification and athletic performance. Int J Sports Physiol Perform [Internet]. 2010 Jun [cited 2012 Jan 3]; 5(2):127-39.

The  aim is to eliminate  unfair advantages by   virtue of either increased androgen levels or increased skeletal   musculature (as a result of disorders of sex); or an unfair height   advantage (as a result of increased growth hormones following oestrogen   hormonal supplements, after sex change surgeries). Though these are   theoretical possibilities, without research evidence, it remains   difficult to disqualify individuals with such sex disorders,  and   categorically say they cannot compete as females. The Canadian Academy   of Sport Medicine also recommends that: &ldquo;Individuals raised as females   and are psychologically and socially females from childhood should be   eligible to compete in women's competition regardless of their   chromosomal, gonadal and hormonal sex" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker R, Collins M.

				</p>
				<p>Thus the ethical issues are:</p>
				<p>
					Sex testing is compulsory rather than voluntary. This is   discriminatory as only females are tested. And as athletes they are   unfairly disqualified for genetic abnormalities which in fact do not   give them an unfair advantage. Third, it is regarded as invasive and   abusive of female athletes. The testing is performed once the athlete   has arrived at an international competition site, away from home and   without her personal support group. The opinions of athletes are not   considered in the debate on sex testing <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Doig P, Smith RI, Prior JC, Sinclair D.

				<p>
					Sex verification in employment (the military), and in professional   beauty contests depends on  contractual policies. However, sex   verification tests must not be unscientific, inhuman, unethical or   irrational or forced on an individual against  her informed consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sex verification in cases like that of Pinki Pramanik depends on   the charges leveled against the accused. Rape is defined under Section   375 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  as a man having  sexual intercourse   with a woman against her will; or without her consent; or with her   consent obtained under fear of death or hurt, etc. Given this, the   charge of rape against her had to be decided by confirming whether Pinki   Pramanik was indeed a male. Under the Indian legal system the   investigating officers are empowered to do everything possible to   investigate a case (including sex verification tests in this case!). In   such sex-specific offences, often they claim that there is no   alternative. But who will judge whether these sex verification tests are   being conducted ethically and in a scientifically approved manner? In   this era of trial by media <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wiesemann C. Is there a right not to know one's sex? The ethics of 'gender verification' in women's sports competition [abstract]. J Med Ethics [Internet]. 2011 [cited 2012 Dec 29]; 37:216-20. Available from: http://jme.bmj.com/content/37/4/216.abstract" id="3">(3)</a> and with unethical practices, the accused   is judged guilty even before being heard in the courts (as was the case   with Pinki Pramanik).
				</p>
				<p>
					When even today's scientific community does not have a single   decisive test for all cases of sex verification, can we blame  our   grannies for giving the wrong verdicts on such sex verification? With   such ignorance, if some innocent individual is raised till puberty with   the wrong sexual identity, is our social environment conducive to   fulfilling their needs? Are we not violating the rights of those   individuals who  recognise themselves with 'a' particular sexual   identity? Unless we identify the third sex legally and socially, most of   these problems will continue. The issues related to individuals who   undergo  sex change surgeries  in order to identify themselves with the    sexual identity of their choice are little understood <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reeser JC. Gender identity and sport: is the playing field level? Br J Sports Med [Internet]. 2005 [cited 2012 Dec 29);39(10):695-9. Available from: http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/39/10/695.full" id="4">(4)</a>. Thus, when   our society is still too backward to address  the issues of the third   sex, only time can provide answers to the ethical, legal and social   issues related to deliberate sex change surgeries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sex verification tests, though accepted by society should not be   forced on any individual against their consent. Nor should they be   performed in violation of the privacy or dignity of the individual. With   the inherent limitations of the accuracy of the results, utmost   confidentiality has to be maintained in disclosing them. With a number    of intricacies involved in a clear understanding of the conditions   causing ambiguity in sexual identity, the authorities, society, and the   media should refrain from making judgments before understanding the   facts of a situation.
