				<p>During the first half of the last century and earlier, the medical profession did precious little about disease. Was it Oliver  														Wendell Holmes who said, 'Take out the poppy, take out the  														foxglove and the willow, it is my belief that, if the rest of the  														material medica were thrown into the sea, it would be so much  														the better for mankind, and so much the worse for the fish,' or  														words to that effect? Those were the days in which the role of  														the medical man was to cure sometimes, to relieve often, to  														comfort always. The idea of the nobility of medicine was born  														in those days and the doctor was often a scholarly man of  														culture.</p>
				<p>We have changed. An incident in the coffee lounge of a hospital I worked at several years ago remains etched in my  														memory. Two surgeons were speaking of a compatriot working  														in their own speciality. 'If I had such and such a disease, I would go to so and so,&quot;he said. 'He is a bastard, but he is a damned  														good surgeon.' What we need is that damned good surgeon  														or physician. It should not matter whether he is a bastard or an  														angel.</p>
				<p>So where do the humanities come in? My dictionary defines the humanities (in plural) as 'learning or literature concerned  														with human culture,' and includes philosophy, history, law,  														literature, linguistics, etc. Does this have anything to do with  														medical practice?</p>
				<p>We enter the profession when we are fresh out of school, and are too young and inexperienced to make a rational  														career choice. We are not prepared for the extent of human  														suffering we have to see, get involved in and sometimes  														be partly responsible for. How do we respond to this? We  														need to develop a philosophical attitude, what William Osler  														labelled Aequanimitas, to be able to take a detached view  														without getting emotionally involved. Some are unable to do  														this. They may drop out of the profession, after wasting a few  														years of their lives and depriving someone else of a precious  														medical seat, or they may move to branches of medicine like  														public health where contact with individual patients does not  														exist. Most of us get inured to it. Some of us get totally hard  														hearted and cease to think of the patient as a person. He or she  														becomes just a case.</p>
				<p>Modern medicine is complicated, especially in our country, and perhaps particularly in nephrology. We are no longer   as  														helpless as we were, but there are enormous costs   associated  														with effective therapy, and we are often in a situation   where  														there is a way to cure a patient or to give him several   years of  														useful, comfortable life, but the price is beyond his   reach. It  														is perhaps better to feel that one has a disease for which   no  														solution exists, than to know there is a solution but one   lacks  														the wherewithal to pay for it. It is not just the patient   who is thus disheartened. I am distressed that only a small minority  														of patients who need dialysis and transplantation succeed  														in going through with the procedure. There seems to be no  														justice in the world. How can one condemn to death a   patient  														one could save, just because he has no money? Even when  														transplantation is possible, it poses a great moral   dilemma.  														The removal of a kidney from a donor, however deep the   love  														that drives the donation, is legally classed as grievous   hurt, and  														carries a risk of death. Are we justified in inflicting   harm on any  														person, however much that person desires it?</p>
				<p>Once we find ourselves in the profession, there are three ways in which we may proceed. We may regard it as a business,  														a trade, a mere commercial transaction, a way to make  														money. We might take it as a profession requiring advanced  														knowledge or training, and view the sick as a scientific problem  														to be solved. This has given rise to the word 'clinical', defined in  														the dictionary as coldly detached and impersonal, objective,  														dispassionate. Or we can take it as a vocation, a mode of  														life requiring dedication. I suggest we would get the most  														satisfaction out of this last. There is no use being devoted to  														our patients if we are not also good, so it is necessary to be  														professional too. We should not think of it as a business, but I  														know of no doctor in this country who has to starve. All of us do  														reasonably well and live in comfort, if not necessarily in luxury.</p>
				<p>The only branch of medicine where the need to consult a doctor (and the outcome) is, as a rule, joyous is obstetrics.  														We practitioners of all other disciplines of medicine thrive on  														human suffering. If we are to succeed, people must fall ill and  														come to us. A society in a state of positive health will have no  														need for the medical profession. Fortunately for us, though  														sadly for mankind, positive health exists only in the textbooks  														of social and preventive medicine and in the deliberations of  														the World Health Organization. I am often troubled by the fact  														that I thrive on the misfortunes of others. One needs some  														guidance to think through these things.</p>
				<p>Literature offers us wonderful route maps. As a medical student I have myself been greatly influenced by A J Cronin,s The citadel. He covered much of the same subject in his  														autobiography, <em>Adventures in two worlds;</em> but The<em> citadel</em> is much  														more interesting. He describes the temptations that beset the  														budding practitioner and guides the reader through the pitfalls  														and the solutions. I will not go through a lengthy bibliography  														here, but each of you will find some books that make you think.  														I derive inspiration from Albert Schweitzer's <em>Out of my life and  														thought: an autobiography</em>. He wrote in German, but an English  														translation is available. Incidentally he did not just have a great  														career as a surgeon, but was a musician and music scholar of  														more than ordinary attainments, an ordained curate and a  														theologist, a philosopher, and a philanthropist.</p>
				<p>We are faced with questions throughout our careers, some we have never considered. I was struck by an incident that was discussed for several weeks in the correspondence  														columns of the BMJ. A smuggler used to bring drugs from the  														continent into the UK by putting the powder into condoms  														and swallowing them. Once safely through Customs, he waited  														for the consignment to make its way out, retrieved it, washed  														the package and repacked it, and then delivered it to the  														dealers. One day his luck ran out and the condom burst in the  														intestine, and he was poisoned with a severe overdose that put  														him in hospital and nearly killed him. The treating physician  														did not report the matter to the police, maintaining that his  														duty of professional secrecy to the patient precluded his doing  														so. I would probably have done the same thing. However, the  														students took the matter into their own hands and reported  														the patient. Their argument, which on reflection I am convinced  														is correct, was that this man led so many of the youth of the  														country to become drug addicts and waste their lives. If he  														were left free, he would resume his activities and ruin yet more  														youngsters. His career needed to be cut short, in the larger  														interests of the country.</p>
				<p>Too often we do not think beyond the surface. A patient needs a transplant and comes to you. What is simpler than to make arrangements to provide him one? There are so many poor  														people ready to sell a kidney for a pittance. The donor did not  														come to you as a supplicant, so his rights automatically take  														second place. A patient wants a false certificate, or wants you to  														support him in getting an insurance claim, though the policy  														was taken after suppressing some vital information of preexisting  														disease. The organisation that is being defrauded is  														faceless, a large impersonal insurance company that has plenty  														of money to pay for it. As one aggrieved patient complained to  														me, 'Your signature could give me five lakhs of rupees. All you  														need is to change that five years to five months and sign it. It  														is not your money. What justification do you have to deny me?'  														I know many doctors who would agree with that viewpoint  														and would sign without hesitation. How does one get to think  														beyond the superficial?</p>
				<p>The history of medicine makes the study of medicine more interesting. It is fascinating to trace the development of our knowledge of disease processes. It is inspiring to learn   of the  														giants who have paved the way for us. 'Lives of great men   all remind us, we can make our lives sublime, and, departing, leave  														behind us, footprints on the sands of time.' (Henry   Wadsworth  														Longfellow)</p>
				<p>I hope I have convinced you that we need some acquaintance with the humanities, to prepare us to face the psychological trauma that medicine often gives us, the loss of a patient, the  														need to deny someone lifesaving treatment because he cannot  														pay for it. We need to have the basic knowledge to consider  														the ethical dilemmas that beset us. We need to be inspired to  														do better and to be better. The answers come from literature,  														philosophy, religion, history, biography. I often turn to the  														Bhagavad Gita, not as a religious text, but as a guide to solve  														all the problems we face as doctors. That is clearly not an  														evidence-based assertion and might be dismissed by the more  														scientifically minded. There are more arguments. One needs to  														be able to put facts across to a patient with clarity, and to be  														able to understand how the patient might think.</p>
				<p>How does one introduce a doctor to the joys and the utility of reading? In some of us the reading habit is inculcated early in life; for others, the university should provide the opportunity.  														Some education in the humanities would equip us better to  														deal with the problems posed by the sick, and would certainly  														make life more enjoyable. Even to the most dedicated doctor,  														a life spent in attending to the sick with no break at all, no  														diversion of any sort, would be a dull one indeed. Osler  														recommended spending the last hour of the day reading  														something outside one,s profession. He made a list of books  														that he suggested be kept at the bedside, and read in bed,  														when it would not matter if the reader fell asleep, book in hand.  														I was taught as a child that it was wrong to read in bed, and  														I have never felt comfortable doing so, and not all of Osler,s  														selection appeals to me, but I try to read something outside  														my profession whenever I travel, so that I am not completely  														ignorant of what happens in the world, or of branches of  														learning outside my own.</p>
				<p>What is right in medicine is often a matter of perspective. We need to widen our knowledge base to enable us to see the issues from all sides, to become 'full men', and we need  														to be taught at an early stage to be offered an entry to the  														humanities to make us better men and women, and thereby better doctors.</p>
