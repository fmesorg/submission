				<h4>Guzaarish. SLB Films and UTV Motion Pictures. Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Guzaarish</em> is the story of a quadriplegic, who after 14 years of valiant survival, decides to petition the court to allow him to die. As his health deteriorates, he is clear that he does not want to be dependent on machines. With the knowledge that he will soon be on a ventilator, he wants to be allowed to die peacefully, while he still has a the ability to decide; but will the courts, society, his friend, his nurse and his doctor give him this liberty?
				</p>
				<p>
					In the first five minutes of the film, you are witness to a man, Ethan Mascarenhas, once described as the greatest magician in the world, now paralysed from the neck down; as he is woken up by a beautiful, exotic-looking woman. She is his nurse, Sophia, played by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. In a refreshing change from the characters the actress usually portrays, Sophia is strong, and meticulous in her care for Ethan. One day, Ethan calls his lawyer, Devyani, and asks her to petition the court for the right to die. Initially, Devyani is shocked and disturbed, but slowly begins to understand his decision and is willing to help him. When Sophia reads about his wish to end his life, she reacts with anger and frustration.. There is a compelling argument between Devyani and Sophia, with an outburst of emotion from Sophia, who has earlier been very controlled. Again, for her and others in the film, Ethan is the object of their intense emotion, yet no one understands his desire to die.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone overlooks the most important fact, which is, that Ethan is existing, thinking and breathing just like the others,, but is not &quot;living&quot; anymore. He keeps having flashbacks of his glorious days as the &quot;greatest magician in the world&quot;. Not that he has given up on life. Following his accident, he has written a book about being paralysed and started a radio show called Radio Zindagi; all of which reminds us that life is indeed beautiful and worth struggling for, no matter what. Now he has reached a point after which he feels death would be the most dignified and worthy end.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since euthanasia is not recognised as legal, the judge dismisses Ethan's first plea. However, Ethan soon petitions listeners of Radio Zindagi and makes an appeal for their understanding. His fans don't want to lose their RJ. Some suggest that he needs counselling, and others accuse him of being a coward and opting for the easy way out. Before a crucial hearing at his home, Ethan's mother, Isabel, arrives to see him and offer support for his petition. Finally, Ethan gets his chance to explain to the judge, his decision to die. He compares his life to being locked in a box, unable to move, but wanting to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					For me, there were several riveting moments in this film, particularly, the death of Ethan's mother. Ethan is lying in his bed and his mother's coffin is placed next to him. It is a very powerful visual, suggesting the similarity of Ethan's position., You feel deeply sorry for him, not even being able to touch his mother for the last time. Another memorable scene shows Omar, a young man to whom Ethan agrees to pass on his legacy, graduate as a magician with flying colours. Ethan asks him to pull a piece of cloth from under him and he unfolds yards and yards of white cloth. Omar is as excited as a child. Ethan is happy just watching the joy on Omar's face, symbolic of the gift of magic Ethan has given Omar, with its endless possibilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Intrigue, anxiety, anguish and romance - all come across so well. A heart-wrenchingly beautiful soundtrack and tantalising cinematography capture the essence of the film. One small criticism would be about the ending, with a party scene.. I would have preferred a quiet close to the film, but it dragged on for an additional 20 minutes. Perhaps the intention is to make the audience feel comfortable with the hero's death., tThe problem is that, as a society, we are so uncomfortable at the thought of anyone wanting to die, that we have to sugarcoat it. So we call it mercy killing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Euthanasia evokes powerful emotions in both its advocates and adversaries. I do hope that both will see this film as opening the door to a subject that has been neglected for far too long.
