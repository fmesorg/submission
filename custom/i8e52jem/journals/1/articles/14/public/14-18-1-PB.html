				<h4>Cheaper HPV vaccines</h4>
				<p>
					The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI)
					has succeeded in its negotiations with the manufacturers of
					human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to lower the price of the
					vaccine. Once considered as the most expensive childhood
					immunisation vaccine in the world, the HPV vaccine has now
					been made available at a relatively cheaper cost of $4.50 and
					$4.60 by the manufacturers Merck and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
					respectively. Pilot vaccination programmes are due in many
					African countries with Rwanda leading the block by making it
					part of the national vaccination programme in 2014. However,
					M&#xE9;decins Sans Fronti&#233;res (MSF) points towards the huge
					profits earned by the drug companies from the HPV vaccine
					and the fact that HPV vaccine, when added to the basic
					immunisation package, increases its cost by 35%. The editorial
					in the <em>Lancet</em> also indicates the need for further reduction
					in the price, as well as the need for stronger health systems
					capable of handling the additional immunisation. In the wake
					of this new development, it would be interesting to follow
					the developments regarding the HPV vaccine in India and
					the case regarding the controversial study of the HPV vaccine
					conducted in 2010.

				<h4>Informed consent and the SUPPORT trial</h4>
				<p>
					A low level of oxygen in the blood is a major cause of mortality
					in premature babies. The Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and
					Oxygenation Randomized Trial (SUPPORT) was initiated in
					multiple centres in the USA in 2005, and was completed
					in 2009. Similar trials were conceived in 2006 in Australia,
					the United Kingdom and New Zealand. At the time of the
					start of the trial, the guidelines of the American Academy of
					Pediatrics recommended the partial pressure of oxygen in
					the blood to be between 50 and 80 mmHg, corresponding
					to oxygen saturation levels of 85% and 95%, respectively.
					Prolonged exposure to supplemental oxygen carried the risk of
					retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), resulting in impaired vision.
					The comparative research enrolled premature babies in two
					groups, one receiving a lower range of oxygen of 85%-89%,
					while the other group received oxygen in the higher range of
					90%-95%. Both sets of babies were receiving oxygen within the
					levels prescribed by the guideline and hence were receiving
					the standard care as specified at that time. The 5-year study
					results showed that &quot;even within the recommended oxygen
					saturation range, babies with a higher saturation level had a higher risk of ROP and those with a lower saturation level had a
					higher risk of death&quot;. Similar findings from the UK and Australia
					studies resulted in a change of practice regarding oxygen
					supply at many medical institutions in 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subsequently, the researchers and investigators were criticised by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) for not including a proper description of risks and discomforts in the informed consent form. The authors contest this allegation
					and point out that the risks were revealed as a result of the
					trial and were not known before the study. They point out
					that the parents were given sufficient information to make an
					informed choice about enrolling their babies in the study. They
					also point out that since the babies in both groups received
					care that fell within the spectrum of standard care, no baby
					was subjected to a higher risk during the course of the study.
					They argue that equating the risks associated with different
					modalities of treatment accepted under the standard care with
					the risks associated with randomisation creates confusion and
					undermines the value of comparative effectiveness research.

				<h4>Setting the standard for rural practitioners</h4>
				<p>
					That India has a shortage of qualified medical practitioners
					working in rural areas is well known to the policy-makers. There
					is also a huge disparity in health indicators between the states
					and within the states. The authors point out that the presence
					of a strong private healthcare system is often not the remedy
					for a weak public healthcare system, as the services of the
					private sector are either not affordable to the poor or are of
					uneven quality. The majority of allopathic doctors practise in
					the urban areas, especially in the private sector. The authors
					express the view that insufficient posts in rural areas as well as
					the insecurity of contractual employment under the National
					Rural Health Mission (NRHM) are dissuading allopathic doctors
					from serving in the rural sector. The authors also highlight
					infrastructural deficiencies and other structural issues related
					to the lack of basic amenities in rural healthcare settings. They
					maintain that creating an unbalanced and biased structure,
					with rural practitioners with insufficient training for the rural
					areas and super specialists with advanced degrees to cater
					to the urban rich is an unjust one. The Licentiate Medical
					Practitioner (LMP) was one such system that has been done
					away with. They express the doubt that the rural practitioner training of three years would be inadequate to equip the
					young practitioner with enough knowledge and skill to deal
					with cases in rural areas, where there is less support from
					technology and referral services. They argue that instead of
					creating a system with lower standards, the effort should be to
					sufficiently incentivise rural practice and also address structural issues associated with the rural centres.

				<h4>Conflict of interest in clinical practice guidelines</h4>
				<p>
					Treatment practices are guided by clinical practice guidelines,
					which in turn are based on expert opinions. The authors
					point out that the conflict of interest of these experts plays a
					significant role as the guidelines recommended by them will
					have an impact on the profits generated by the pharmaceutical
					companies. The study looks at the prevalence of conflict of
					interest and its under-reporting by the authors of the clinical
					practice guidelines in Denmark between July 2010 and March
					2012. The authors looked at five guidelines each of those issued
					by the 27 Danish clinical specialty societies between July 2010
					and March 2012; limiting their study to guidelines dealing
					with drugs and not procedures. 45 clinical practice guidelines
					satisfying the inclusion criteria were finally selected which had
					a total of 247 individual authors. The study revealed that 53% of
					the authors involved had conflicts of interest and that 96% of
					the guidelines had one or the other author who had conflict of
					interest. However, only one guideline had declared the conflict
					of interest of its authors publicly. The authors also found that
					only six societies provided manuals for the preparation of
					guidelines, with no society providing any instruction for the
					declaration of conflict of interest. The authors recommend a
					disclosure list with full financial information of the authors
					to help in maintaining transparency. They also maintain that
					disclosure will not eliminate bias and a more concrete step
					would be to include only those experts without any conflict
					of interest in the process of preparing a clinical treatment
					guideline.

				<h4>Relevance of baby hatches</h4>
				<p>
					This article talks about the arguments raised for and against
					baby hatches in the Japanese context. A baby hatch is a place
					where mothers can leave their babies anonymously and the
					babies thus left are taken care of. First introduced in Germany,
					baby hatches are currently in place in 20 countries including
					India. In this paper, the authors discuss the major criticisms of
					the concept of baby hatches. These include denial of the baby's
					right to know the identity of his/her biological parents. The
					authors argue that forcing parents to reveal their identity might
					push them towards more extreme steps such as infanticide or abortion thereby jeopardising the right to life; and that in
					such instances, the right to anonymity of the parent should be
					upheld in the best interests of the parent and the child. Another
					criticism is that it induces abandonment of babies for selfish
					reasons, which is countered by supporters of the facility stating
					that leaving the baby in the hatch is not exactly abandonment;
					and that its purpose is to protect the baby rather than leaving
					him/her unattended and uncared for. They also point out that
					often there are compelling reasons behind the decision to
					leave a baby in the hatch, including lack of family and societal
					support, single parenthood, poverty, mental disorders of the
					parent, etc. While the authors do not refute the fact that some
					may actually abuse the system of baby hatches, they believe
					that there are people who genuinely need such a support
					system. The authors also discuss the criticism that baby hatches
					compromise the right of one parent if the other parent decides
					to drop the baby without the partner's consent and that it puts
					the child's life in peril. However, they argue that there is a need to distinguish between hardships arising exclusively due to the presence of baby hatches, and those which are more general in
					nature. They also point out that legal ambiguity alone cannot
					be a justification for terminating the service of baby hatches;
					and that societal realities should be taken into consideration
					while deciding on the future of such services.

				<h4>Hiring policies related to smoking</h4>
				<p>
					The practice of not hiring smokers as employees is becoming
					increasingly prevalent, especially in organisations in the
					health sector. The authors agree with 65% of Americans
					who through a poll expressed their dissatisfaction with such
					hiring policies and state legislations that considerably reduce
					employment opportunities for smokers in such environments.
					Organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO)
					have taken the stand that their hiring policy is in alignment
					with their commitment towards tobacco control and that their
					employees are expected to act as role models for patients.
					Another argument in favour of not hiring smokers is that they
					should be taking responsibility for the extra burden placed by
					them on other employees and employers. The authors argue
					that such practices are counterproductive, since they place an
					extra burden on the already disadvantaged population, and
					jeopardise other more effective methods of quitting smoking.
					They point out that these very same health organisations strive
					hard to care for patients whose ill health can also be attributed
					to their behaviour. They point out that a smoking habit often
					starts early and becomes addictive and soon the individual
					loses control over the habit. They refute the financial argument
					by pointing out the high cost of care, absenteeism and burden
					associated with many other conditions which could also be
					the result of simple lifestyle choices. They argue that since the
					prevalence of smoking is higher among the unemployed and
					less educated groups, the discrimination in hiring based on tobacco use adds to their already existing burden and stigma.
					The authors opine that more positive measures should be
					employed to assist employees who smoke to quit smoking
					rather than discriminating and not hiring them in the first
					place.
				</p>
				<p>
					A counterargument is that such restrictive policies are for
					the common good and that in the long run they have a
					positive effect on the same population that would have felt
					disadvantaged in the first place. Another article cites the
					example of the Cleveland clinic which stopped hiring nonsmokers
					in 2007, and the county where the clinic is situated showed a higher percentage of reduction in smoking rates when compared to the whole state. They maintain that harsher steps become inevitable when gentle interventions fail to produce the desired result.
