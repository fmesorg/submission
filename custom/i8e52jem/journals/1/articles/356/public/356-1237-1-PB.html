			<h3>Patent dispute: Delhi High Court gives a boost to access to affordable

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The Delhi High Court has rejected the petition filed by Bayer Corporation seeking to stop the Drugs Controller of India (DCGI) from registering a generic version of a patented cancer drug. The case was filed in 2008 by Bayer to try and introduce &quot;patent linkage&quot;, which involves linking the registration (marketing approval) of drugs with their patent status. If Bayer's plea for &quot;patent linkage&quot; had been accepted by the court, it would have undermined public health safeguards contained in India's patent legislation. This comment discusses the Bayer case in the context of efforts by multinational pharmaceutical companies to introduce barriers to generic competition, the only proven means of reducing the prices of medicines to make them affordable to those in need. Bayer has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, indicating that it does not intend to give up.

				<p>
					India is home to a large pharmaceutical generic industry that in addition to meeting domestic needs also supplies the developing world. However, its domestic production of essential medicines is constantly under threat - both from intellectual property norms adopted in trade agreements and from patent disputes that are being brought against the government of India by multinational pharmaceutical companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a positive development, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court stopped the German pharmaceutical company Bayer Corporation's latest attempt to introduce new &quot;patent policing
					measures&quot; to prevent generic competition in India. By ruling against Bayer on February 9, 2010, the Delhi High Court refused to undermine legal safeguards in India's patent law that help ensure access to more affordable essential medicines for patients in India and other developing countries. However, the battle is by no means over. Bayer has filed an appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="G olikeri P.

				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					Generic competition is the only proven means of reducing the prices of medicines to more affordable levels. AIDS and cancer treatment are an important illustration of the benefits of encouraging generic production. Currently the majority of people living with HIV on treatment in low- and middle-income countries use generic antiretroviral drugs manufactured mostly from India <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medicins Sans Frontieres. Examples of the importance of India as the â€œPharmacy of the Developing Worldâ€, [Internet]. 2007 Jan. [cited 2010 Mar 15]. Available from: http://www.msfaccess.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ medinnov_accesspatents/Overview%20Jan%202007%20FINAL.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. It was only with the arrival of generic antiretrovirals produced by Indian companies on the market in 2001 that prices started to reduce significantly - from $10,439 to $350 per patient per year for first-line AIDS treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first fixed dose combination of stavudine/ lamivudine/ nevirapine was developed by Cipla and went on to become instrumental in rolling out antiretroviral therapy in Africa, Latin America and Asia and other developing countries including India. Today, it is available for as little as US$80 per patient per year - 1/130th of the price demanded by multinational pharmaceutical companies in 2001. With continued generic production, the price of improved firstline AIDS treatment (the three-in-one fixed-dose combination of tenofovir/ lamivudine/ efavirenz) has also dropped considerably over the last two years (43% reduction) to US$ 243 per patient per year <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines.

				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, the generic production, by Indian drug manufacturers, of imatinib, a crucial cancer drug essential in prolonging the life of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) played a crucial role in significantly increasing the access of cancer patients to this drug. The drug is considered to be the first line of treatment for CML, fights cancer cells without being toxic to healthy cells, and has to be taken lifelong. In addition, it is now being tested for treating other forms of cancer. The generic version of imatinib is priced at less than one tenth of the price of the originator at approximately Rs 8,000 per patient per month, compared to Novartis' price of approximately Rs 1,20,000 per patient per month.
				</p>
				<p>
					That is because, until recently, India did not grant patents on
					medicines <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WPO, World Intellectual Property Organisation [Internet]. Geneva: WPO. India Patents Act, 19/09/1970, No.39 ; 1970 Sep21[cited 2010 Mar 16]; 68p. Available from: http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_pdf. jsp?lang=EN&id=2393" id="4">(4)</a>, which allowed Indian generic manufacturers
					to compete with multinational pharmaceutical companies
					and with each other to produce lower-priced generic versions
					of drugs patented in other countries. This sort of generic
					competition among multiple producers is what made the cost
					of AIDS medicines fall dramatically and helped facilitate the
					scale-up of antiretroviral therapy to millions living with HIV in
					the developing world.

				<h4>Patents in India threaten a key source of affordable
				medicines</h4>
				<p>
					However, India is drying up as a source of affordable versions
					of newer and future medicines. This is due to amendments
					made to India's patent law in 2005 <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Law and Justice. Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005[Internet]. New Delhi: Government of India; 2005 Apr 5[cited 2010 Mar 16]. Available from: http://www.patentoffice.nic.in/ipr/patent/patent_2005. pdf" id="5">(5)</a>, when the country was required to begin reviewing pharmaceutical product patents
					according to its international obligations under the World
					Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade Related aspects
					of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
				</p>
				<p>
					Patenting of medicines in India could mean that Indian
					manufacturers will no longer be able to produce cheaper
					versions of newer medicines. Precisely such newer drugs are
					crucial, for example, for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C,
					cancer and other diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, when the Indian Parliament amended its patent
					law in 2005, an effort was made to find a balance between the
					intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies and
					the need to protect public health, ensure supply to national

					treatment programmes and make drugs as affordable as
					possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					While section 3(d) of the amended Indian Patent Act, 2005, was
					inserted to safeguard against the granting of frivolous patents
					on trivial improvements of known molecules, there was also a
					great concern about those new drugs (new chemical entities)

					invented after 1995 that would be patented under Indian
					law. To this end, key safeguards in India's amended patent
					law such as the &quot;early working exception&quot; (section 107 A) and
					the provisions on compulsory licensing (sections 84, 92, 92A

					and 100) were also included in the law to ensure generic
					production in the event that patent holders failed to fulfill their
					duty to make patented medicines available and affordable to
					patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now both the early working exception and compulsory
					licensing provisions that create mechanisms for generic
					competition are at considerable risk because of a pending
					court case filed by Bayer against the Union of India and the
					Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The Bayer case against the Union of India</h4>
				<p>
					After the 2005 amendment of the Indian patent law,
					multinational pharmaceutical companies have been pushing
					India's drug regulator, the DCGI, to implement patent linkage in
					India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Establishing a link between patent status on the one hand
					and the registration (also known as marketing approval) of
					a medicine on the other hand means that a national drug
					regulatory authority is required to withhold marketing
					approval to a generic version of a patented drug, regardless of
					whether the patent granted is valid or not.
				</p>
				<p>
					A petition was filed by Bayer in 2008, seeking to stop the
					DCGI from granting marketing approval to a generic version
					of a patented cancer drug. The case was filed before the Delhi
					High Court on the grounds that the DCGI had entertained
					the application for granting marketing approval to a generic
					version of the anti-cancer drug sorafenib tosylate, for which
					Bayer has obtained a patent (IN215758) in India. (Sorafenib is a
					drug approved for the treatment of renal and liver cancer.)
				</p>
				<p>
					By filing this case against the Indian government, Bayer seeks to
					ensure that Indian drug regulatory authorities do not register a
					cheaper generic version of a drug, if it is patented.
				</p>
				<p>
					All medicines to be sold in the Indian market require prior marketing approval from the DCGI. If Bayer's demands in its
					case against the government of India are accepted, it will
					block the marketing approval of generic versions of patented

					medicines - even if the patent is wrongly granted or the
					approval is with the objective of applying for a compulsory
					license or entering the market once the patent has expired.
				</p>
				<p>
					But a drug regulatory authority's role is to ensure that
					medicines marketed in a country are proved to be of quality,
					safe and effective: it delivers a necessary green light before a
					drug can be manufactured or marketed. Its role is not to deal
					with the patent status of the medicines, which is the role of a
					country's patent office.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Chronology of the Bayer case</h4>
				<p>
					The petition was first heard by a single judge bench of the
					Delhi High Court in 2009 and was dismissed as &quot;vexatious
					and luxury litigation&quot;. Justice Ravindra Bhat rejected Bayer's
					petition seeking to prevent the DCGI from registering Cipla's

					version of sorafenib and made it clear that &quot;Bayer's argument of
					inferring drug agencies' role in patent policing or enforcement
					is unacceptable.&quot; <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="High Court of New Delhi. Bayer Corporation & Ors vs. Union of India& Ors. WP(C) No.7833/2008 [Internet]. New Delhi: High Court of New Delhi; 2009 Aug 18 [cited 2010 Mar 16].

				</p>
				<p>
					Bayer filed an appeal against the decision before the Division
					Bench of the Delhi High Court.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a welcome move for access to medicines, this decision was
					upheld by the Division Bench in February 2010. In the words of
					the judges of the Division Bench,
				</p>
				<p>
					This Court concurs with the learned Single Judge that the
					scheme of both the Patents Act and the Drugs &amp; Cosmetic
					Act are distinct and separate and that the attempt by
					the appellant Bayer to establish a linkage cannot be
					countenanced. If Bayer's argument were to be accepted, it
					would mean that instead of the validity of the patent being
					tested, if at all, either in revocation proceedings or by way of
					a counter-claim in infringement proceedings instituted by
					the patent holder, the DCGI will begin with the presumption
					that the patent granted in respect of the drug for which
					marketing approval is sought has been validly granted. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="High Court of New Delhi. Bayer Corporation & Ors vs. Union of India& Ors. LPA 443/2009 [Internet]. New Delhi: High Court of New Delhi; 2010 Feb 9 [cited 2010 Mar 16]. Available from: http://www.lawyerscollective. org/sites/default/files/Bayer_v._Union_of_India_[Appeal]_0.pdf" id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					But Bayer has now dragged the Indian drug regulator and the
					Indian government to the Supreme Court. It has filed a special
					leave petition against the decision of the Delhi High Court
					in the Supreme Court which was admitted for hearing on
					February 26, 2010.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Implications of the Delhi High Court decision</h4>
				<p>
					The Court's decision was very important because it stopped
					Bayer's attempt to introduce a new barrier to generic
					competition and ensured that different public health
					safeguards in India's patents law remain useable.
				</p>
				<p>
					One safeguard in the patent law, known as the &quot;Bolar&quot; or &quot;early
					working exception&quot;, allows a generic producer to manufacture
					a drug even when it is under patent and obtain marketing
					authorisation in advance, so that a generic can be put on the

					market as soon as the patent is invalidated or revoked, or
					expires. India's patent law allows manufacturers to do this
					without fear of facing an infringement suit.
				</p>
				<p>
					A second safeguard is compulsory licensing. Compulsory
					licenses can be issued to generic producers if patented essential
					medicines are not available or affordable in India, or if other
					countries which lack production capacity order essential drugsfrom India. But if Bayer had succeeded in introducing patent
					linkage in India, this could have blocked the marketing approval
					of generic medicines made under the terms of a compulsory
					license, thereby rendering the compulsory license useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					These public health safeguards will become increasingly
					important as the effect of the newly introduced pharmaceutical
					product patent regime is felt in the country. The TRIPS
					Agreement made it mandatory for India to have a patent
					regime for medicines by 2005.
				</p>
				<p>
					Five years after India revised its 1970 Patents Act, patent offices
					have granted product patents on several drugs, including
					medicines for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C and cancer. The patented
					drugs are prohibitively expensive and in the absence of generic
					competitors will remain out of reach of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					On March 3, 2006, Roche proudly announced it was &quot;becoming
					the first pharmaceutical company in India to receive a product
					patent under the new patent regime&quot;. The patent granted is on
					peginterferon alfa-2a, a new generation hepatitis C therapy. The
					cost of this therapy is prohibitively high - above Rs 12,000 for a
					single dose vial of 180 mg.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Patent linkage in other countries</h4>
				<p>
					Efforts to link registration (marketing approval) of drugs with
					their patent status are not new and have been pushed by the
					multinational pharmaceutical industry, its associations, and the
					United States. Several developing countries have been under

					pressure to introduce patent linkages. Chile, Morocco and
					Bahrain were made to accept TRIPS-plus provisions, including
					patent linkages, in the Free Trade Agreements that they signed
					with the US.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2006, Pfizer filed a case in the Philippines against the
					drug regulators (Bureau of Food and Drugs or BFAD) and a
					government-owned pharmaceutical company (PITC, Philippine
					International Trading Corporation) to prevent them from
					registering a generic version of a patented medicine. PITC
					had started the process of registering the generic version of
					amlodipine besylate with the BFAD by submitting samples
					imported from India so that it could obtain marketing approval
					(registration) and then promptly enter the market when Pfizer's
					Philippines patent on amlodipine besylate expired in June 2007.
					The drug is used to treat high blood pressure and is considerably
					cheaper (5 times) in India because of generic competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subsequent to the above mentioned court case, the Philippines
					government eliminated patent linkage and intellectual
					property protection from the responsibilities of BFAD under a
					department of health administrative order, AO No 2005-0001.
					The order permits BFAD to consider and process applications
					for marketing approval of generic versions of medicines
					without the need to verify whether or not the pharmaceutical
					being submitted for registration is under patent <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Love J.

				</p>
				<p>
					The European Union does not implement patent linkage. The
					EU Directorate General for Competition has noted that &quot;patentlinkage
					is considered unlawful under Regulation (EC) No
					726/2004 and Directive (EC) No 2001/83&quot; and has documented
					the widespread use of litigation (including that against drug
					regulators) in attempts to enforce patent linkages, much like
					Bayer's case in India <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="European Commission Competition Directorate General staff.

					company, is in court in India attempting to get rights that it
					does not even enjoy in Europe.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the US, which has a patent linkage system, the use of the
					system by patent holders to delay generic entry has been
					recorded in detail by the US Federal Trade Commission <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Federal Trade Commision.

					In addition, its Food and Drug Administration has officially
					stated that its resources would be better utilised in reviewing
					applications than in reviewing patent claims, in addition to

				<h4>How companies use patent linkage to block generics:
				the case of fluconazole in Africa</h4>
				<p>
					Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has documented a typical
					case of how patent linkage can affect access to medicines. An
					Indian generic manufacturer was refused marketing approval
					by the drug regulator in an African country for its generic
					version of fluconazole, a drug used to treat opportunistic
					infections associated with HIV. On investigation, MSF learnt
					that the grounds for this refusal was that the drug regulator
					had been informed by the originator pharmaceutical
					company that it had a patent on the drug in the country. The
					drug regulator had no legal obligation to refuse registration
					on such grounds, but it had been pressured to do so by the
					pharmaceutical company. Under further investigation, it was
					revealed that the originator pharmaceutical company's claim
					was false and that the patent had expired more than a year
					earlier. The drug regulator eventually retracted its decision,
					and allowed the registration of the Indian company's low-cost
					generic version of the drug <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medicins Sans Frontieres.

				<h4>World Health Organization's advice on the issue</h4>
				<p>
					In March 2006, the World Health Organization issued a briefing
					note on &quot;access to medicines&quot; in which it discussed the impact
					of TRIPS-plus provisions. This note states that patent linkages
					are problematic as drug regulators are likely not to possess the
					resources or manpower to check the patent status of medicines.
					Moreover they would lack the necessary expertise to assess
					whether a patent is valid or would be infringed and would thus
					be more likely to enforce all patents including invalid ones.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The Cancer Patients Aid Association intervenes to
				protect patients' interests</h4>
				<p>
					By filing this case against the Indian government, Bayer
					wants to set a legal precedent which will require the DCGI to
					block regulatory approval of affordable versions of patented
					medicines - even if the generic has been proved to be of
					quality, safe and effective. As discussed above, this will seriously
					undermine the use of provisions in Indian law that ensure that
					even patented medicines are available and affordable in India
					and other developing countries.The Cancer Patients Aid Association had filed an intervention
					application in Bayer's case against the government of India in
					the Delhi High Court. It intends to continue defending patients'
					interests in the Supreme Court of India. At stake are patients'
					lives across the developing world.
