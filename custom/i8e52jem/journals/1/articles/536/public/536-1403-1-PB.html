				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Having enjoyed considerable success in kidney transplantation in recent years, Iran has been named the most active country in the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation region in providing equitable, quick, and intermediary-free access to affordable kidney transplantation for everyone regardless of gender and economic circumstances. We are, however, of the opinion that the Iranian model can benefit further from improving deceased-donor kidney transplantation, especially after a fatwa (Islamic edict) in the early 1980s lifted many religious and legal barriers. Deceased-donor kidney transplantation in Iran should be bolstered by establishing a transplantation model, increasing government funds, and encouraging participation of the general public in the Iranian Network for Transplant Organ Procurement. We recommend that an intensive media campaign be launched to heighten public awareness and more transplantation centres be involved in cadaveric transplantation with streamlined systems of cadaveric donations registration so as to facilitate the process of finding and relating the donors with potential recipients.

					Although the efficacy of the Iranian model of kidney transplantation has already been established, there is a growing need to discuss the status of cadaveric transplantation and suggest means to improve it. We sought to survey the status of deceased-donor kidney transplantation in Iran with a view to offering a statistical description and stating possible limitations and opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Iranian model of kidney transplantation, the living non-related donor (LNRD) programme was designed for the expansion of the kidney donor pool, with genetically unrelated but emotionally related friends and altruistically motivated volunteers comprising the highest number of organ donors. Table 1 presents some important characteristics of this model <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Einollahi B. Iranian experience with the non-related renal transplantation. Saudi J Kidney Dis Transplant 2004;15(4):421-8." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Renal Patients Support Charity (RPSC), a non-governmental charity founded in 1978 by patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under the aegis of the government, runs all the stages of kidney transplantation. Patients with ESRD are confirmed officially, by nephrologists, after appropriate examinations and tests. If a patient is suitable for a transplant, the nephrologist refers him/her to the RPSC, which acts as a liaison agency between potential donors and recipients. The altruistic volunteers register with the RPSC and undergo evaluation in the foundation's clinics. Donors are all 18-35 years old; permission for registration from parents or spouses is mandatory. The potential donor should be in complete health, and consents are obtained prior to introduction to the potential recipient. The RPSC receives no financial incentives for finding a donor or for referring the recipient and the donor to a transplantation centre. There is no role for an intermediary or agency in this model; the donor and recipient are introduced to each other at the RPSC and agree upon the centre to be referred to. All kidney transplantation centres are university hospitals and are licensed by the government <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Einollahi B.

					By the year 2000, only 84 cadaveric renal transplantations had been performed in Iran <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ghods AJ. Renal transplantation in Iran. Nephrol Dial Transplant 2002; 17: 222-8." id="3">(3)</a>. In April 2000, the Iranian parliament permitted cadaveric organ donation after brain death. Since then, cadaveric renal transplantation has enjoyed a gradual rise <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ghods AJ. Should we have live unrelated donor renal transplantation in MESOT Countries? Transplant Proc 2003; 35:2542-4." id="2">(2)</a>. Before the year 2004, less than one per cent of kidney transplantation in Iran came from cadavers, whereas cadaveric transplantation currently accounts for more than 10 per cent of the annual renal transplantation in Iran <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Einollahi B.

				<h4>Cadaveric transplantation and religious beliefs</h4>
				<p>
					Transplantation has opened a Pandora's box of complicated religious and moral problems. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants are inclined to give their blessings to organ donation, believing that the prior disposal of body parts will not hamper resurrection. Jewish law, while prohibiting mutilation and delays in the burial of a corpse, makes provisions for overriding this disallowance to save a life. The Islamic Organisation of Medical Sciences paved the way for cadaveric transplantation many years ago by adopting a resolution recognising brain death. The largest religious belief which for a long time remained opposed to the idea of brain death is Shintoism in Japan, rendering this otherwise scientifically advanced country unable to practise cadaveric transplantation of organs until recently when the Japanese parliament was obliged to intervene. Hindu and Vedic scholars accept the concept of brain death <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P. Brain death and organ transplantation in India. New Delhi: National Medical Journal of India; 1990:30." id="13">(13)</a>. The concept of giving is deep-rooted in the Hindu school of thought; accordingly, there seems to be no major religious objection to the act of organ donation <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S.

				<h4>Problems regarding the concept of brain death</h4>
				<p>
					The concept of brain death &mdash; or more precisely brain stem death &mdash; has not failed to create its own share of problems, either. The burden on the medical community vis-&agrave;-vis the said issue is two-fold: not only are the professionals required to assure the public at large of the ethics of organ donation following brain stem death but they also have to ensure that the criteria of brain stem death are coherently enunciated and fastidiously enforced <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Colabawalla BN.

				<h4>Barriers to cadaveric transplantation in Asian countries</h4>
				<p>
					In contrast to developed countries, the undeveloped nations have no organised cadaveric transplantation programme. Utilisation of cadaveric kidneys in Asian countries leaves a great deal to be desired <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kher V. End stage renal disease in developing countries. Kidney Int 2002; 62:350-62." id="16">(16)</a>, and an overwhelming majority of transplants are performed using living donors, which has given rise to the nefarious practice of selling kidneys for transplantation in some areas <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jha V. End-stage renal care in developing countries: the India experience. Ren Fail 2004 May;26(3):201-8." id="17">(17)</a>. In Asian countries, it is difficult to obtain cadaveric kidneys for renal transplantation not just because of a lack of legal recognition of "brain death" but because of certain socio-cultural beliefs such as concern about being cut up after death, the desire to be buried whole, dislike of the idea of one's kidneys being inside another person, a misapprehension about brain death, and the idea of donation being against religious conviction <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Woo KT. Social and cultural aspects of organ donation in Asia. Ann Acad Med Singapore 1992 May;21(3):421-7." id="18">(18)</a>. Cadaveric donation is also hindered by a host of beliefs about ghosts, labelled as "feudal superstitions". People in countries like Hong Kong, Japan, and the Philippines share the same Asian tradition of not parting with their organs after death. In some countries like Malaysia, kidneys can be harvested at death if the owner of the organs has earlier pledged his kidneys for donation prior to death <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Woo KT. Social and cultural aspects of organ donation in Asia. Ann Acad Med Singapore 1992 May;21(3):421-7." id="18">(18)</a>. In response to organ shortages, the Chinese medical community has expanded the range of eligible sources to include those condemned to death as criminals <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ikels C. Kidney failure and transplantation in China. Soc Sci Med 1997 May;44(9):1271-83." id="19">(19)</a>; as a result, many patients travel to China for kidneys coming from executed convicts. The Japanese organ transplantation law, enacted in 1997, allows organ procurement from brain-dead as well as non-heart-beating cadavers in very restricted conditions <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bagheri A, Shoji S.
