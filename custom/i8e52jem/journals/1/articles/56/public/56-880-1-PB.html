				A one-day conference on emerging issues in ethics and  													regulation of medical research was organised by the  													Department of Research, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital  													and Research Centre (DMHRC), Pune, on January12, 2013. The  													meeting was attended by 270 participants.

				<p>
					The conference was inaugurated by <strong>Dr Dhananjay Kelkar</strong>,  													Medical Director of the hospital. He summarised the <strong>current  													situation in medical research</strong> and stressed the necessity for  													clinical research to focus on the health needs of the country  													rather than being donor driven. In the present scenario, he  													said, there is every chance of conflict of interest due to the  													incentives attached to clinical research. He also pointed out  													that if we do not follow ethics, we will be bound by regulation. <em>He encouraged the delegates saying that this conference would  													serve as an important step on the path to forming a better society,  													better science and a better future.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The keynote speech was delivered by <strong>Dr Roli Mathur</strong>, Scientist'C', Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on the <strong>current  													scenario and prospects in clinical research in India</strong>.   She said  													that though India is a hot spot for clinical trials, its   contribution  													is inadequate compared to other countries. We should use   this  													opportunity to develop new drugs that will be beneficial   and  													affordable for our own people and for the diseases that   concern  													them. Bodies like the ICMR are ready to provide funding but  													they need to ensure that the research being done is   ethical.  													She gave examples of unethical research which show that  													doctors are turning into businessmen and there is erosion   of  													public trust in the medical profession. She added that the   ICMR  													is accountable to agencies like the National Human Rights  													Commission for such lapses and for preventing them. She  													drew attention to lacunae in regulatory systems and the   need  													to correct them, especially in the light of the Supreme   Court's recent criticism of the conduct of clinical research in India.   She  													also touched upon problems with ethics committees (ECs)  													such as the lack of periodic assessment of research   projects;  													member's insufficient understanding of protocols and their  													own roles, and their assessment of adherence to guidelines.  													Dr Mathur also informed the delegates about the upcoming  													Biomedical and Health Research Regulation Bill which will  													regulate medical research as well as the functioning of   ECs.  													She stressed that an EC is no longer a part-time activity.   She  													pointed out the importance of initial and continued   training  													to EC members, not only on good clinical practices (GCPs)   but  													also on basic knowledge of various research areas like   clinical  													medicine and epidemiology. She advised EC members to be   more vigilant in reviewing research involving a product which  													does not require market authorisation.

					<strong>Dr Sunil K Pandya</strong>, Editor Emeritus of the <em>Indian Journal  													of Medical Ethics</em>, spoke on <strong>current issues in the ethics of  													medical research</strong>. Dr Pandya focused on worrying aspects of  													today's medical research, primarily regarding researchers. He  													stressed that only qualified researchers should do research  													and they should do only research that needs validation on the  													Indian population. He elaborated on some prevailing practices  													adopted by researchers that raise questions about their  													commitment to the cause. According to him, research is often  													substandard and done in a haphazard manner. He touched  													upon the practice of selling products at exorbitant prices  													without any justification. He gave the examples of stem cell  													research and anti-ageing therapies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandya talked about the evolution of the informed consent  													process in medical research. He stressed that consent must  													be <em>truly</em> informed consent. We must find ways to ensure  													that the fruits of research reach the participants. At least a  													small proportion of the monetary benefits should reach the  													participants who have given their tissues for research. Often,  													researchers have little say in what is published. Therefore  													we need to be very vigilant. Researchers must take care that  													what is being published is the whole truth, and not just what  													is palatable or convenient. He gave examples of types of fraud  													in medical research. He concluded by calling for serious action  													against persons committing fraud.

					<strong>Mr Mudassir Khalil</strong>, Deputy Manager-Liability Insurance,  													Bajaj Allianz, spoke on <strong>insurance for clinical trial participants</strong>.  													Mr Khalil explained that a compensation agreement was a predecided  													agreement which mentions the kind of insurance  													available for specific injuries. He threw light on some issues  													that an EC should look for while evaluating the insurance for  													a research study: checking that the trial period was within  													the insurance period and ensuring that the policy is renewed  													in time to avoid gaps; checking that the trial site is within  													the geographical limits of the policy; and insisting that the  													sponsors acquire insurance cover for an extended reporting  													period in studies involving drugs which may cause long-term  													or delayed side effects. Other relevant questions to be asked  													are: What are the possibilities of injury? What is the expected  													severity of a serious adverse event (SAE) if it occurs? What are  													the social parameters regarding the trial population? How  													many subjects are involved in a study?
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr Khalil clarified that the insurance company's liability is limited  													to the amount covered in the agreement; any compensation  													beyond this, if required, would be the sponsor's responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, all phases and types of studies are covered under  													insurance; the difference is in the sum insured and the  													premiums. The company does not cover pre-existing  													conditions; failure of the drug to do what it was intended to  													do; or radioactive contamination unless the study involves the  													use of such drug. Payment is both for compensation for injury  													as well as the legal costs. He also explained how the company  													processes claims. If a pre-existing condition gets aggravated  													due to participation in the study, it is covered. Mental problems  													and agony are not covered under the policy unless they lead to  													a disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					He reminded participants of the points to be remembered for  													a valid claim: timely feedback to the insurance company, an  													understanding of the process of claim by the researcher, and  													reporting of SAEs as defined in the agreement.

					<strong>Mrs Suchela Srivatsa</strong>, Head &quot; Integrated Site Services, for  													Quintiles India Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, discussed the<strong> ethical  													challenges in research in India</strong> that have resulted in  													today's tarnished image of India and the medical profession.  													She suggested that we need to work jointly on low-cost,  													sustainable models, establish more practical policies that are  													relevant for the Indian scenario, and partner with the media  													in educating patients about clinical trials. She discussed the  													ethical responsibilities of sponsors, trial / site investigators,  													EC members, contract research organisations, regulators and  													trial participants; and the scope for improvement by all these  													stakeholders in clinical research. She stressed the urgent need  													for patient education and said that patient registries would be  													useful to recruit the right type of patients.

					<strong>Dr Urmila Thatte</strong>, Professor and Head, Department of Clinical  													Pharmacology, Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital,  													Mumbai, spoke on <strong>accreditation for ethics committees</strong>. Dr  													Thatte began by mentioning important reports regarding  													functioning of Institutional Review Boards in the USA. She gave  													the definition of accreditation as 'self assessment, external peer  													review against international standard's It is a voluntary and  													continuous quality improvement process. She discussed some  													benefits of accreditation: uniform standards for ECs across  													the country, improved public trust, preferential site selection,  													and research grant approval. She mentioned the agencies for  													accreditation-Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in  													Ethical Review and Association for the Accreditation of Human  													Research Protection Programs-and explained the process by  													which they provided accreditation. She advised the delegates  													to become part of the Forum for Ethical Review Committees of  													India and support the building up of a system of national level  													accreditation. Dr Thatte stated that the accreditation process  													provided guidance about each EC member's duty; however,  													ECs should have their own guidelines. It is the chairperson's  													responsibility to ensure that each member makes their due  													contribution as an EC member.

					The speakers were followed by researchers who spoke on  													research ethics from the perspective of their work.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Manisha Paliwal</strong>, Associate Professor, Sinhgad Institute  													of Management, Pune, spoke of the<strong> relevance of ethics in  													the field of nursing</strong>. She explained how the interdisciplinary  													approach provided a theoretical overview and dealt with  													emerging ethical issues in nursing. She described the difference  													between medicine and nursing. Nursing compassionately helps  													people adapt to chronic illness and incapacity, and focuses on  													'nurturing'. Medicine tries to defeat the conditions that produce  													chronic pain and incapacity, and focuses on combating illness,  													malfunction, and injury. She added that despite the differences  													in the two fields, ethical medical decision-making must  													integrate healing and nurturing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Anand Shinde</strong>, IVF Consultant and Director Andrology  													at DMHRC, spoke on the<strong> importance of ethics in assisted  													reproductive technologies</strong>. This new technology has provided  													solutions but posed many ethical dilemmas, which, he said,  													should be discussed in open public fora by couples, doctors,  													law makers, ethicists, and the lay public.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Akshay Kulkarni</strong>, Microbiologist and Clinical Embryologist,  													spoke on how the three fundamental tenets of ethics &quot;  													autonomy, justice and beneficence with non-maleficence &quot;  													apply to the patient of<strong> in-vitro fertilisation</strong>, and the embryo,  													in both applied and research scenarios. The ethics behind using  													human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem  													cells was discussed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Padmakar Pandit</strong>, Professor and Head of the Department  													of Clinical Pharmacology and EC Member Secretary, BJ Medical  													College and Sassoon General Hospital, Pune, spoke on<strong> ethical  													issues in trials involving elderly patients</strong>. He discussed the  													pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes that occur  													with age, and highlighted the importance of a pharmacological  													screen. There is a need for research on drug-drug interactions,  													with emphasis on interactions with drugs commonly used in  													geriatric populations. Also, elderly patients might benefit from  													appointing a legally authorised representative.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Dakshayani Pandit</strong>, Consultant Microbiologist, Dr DY Patil  													Medical College and Research Centre, Pimpri, Pune, spoke  													on the subject of<strong> informed consent in emergencies</strong>. She  													highlighted the fact that 'voluntary' and 'informed' are two  													keywords in this concept. When consent from the subject is not  													possible in emergency situations, consent must be obtained  													from the LAR. In the absence of an LAR, measures listed in the  													protocol must be followed, with EC approval. She underlined  													the importance of the data safety monitoring committee,  													especially in the case of research on critical patients or in  													emergency situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					A panel discussion in the post-lunch session concerned  													forming an association of ECs in Pune. About 60 EC members  													attended the session. Participants spoke on the need for such  													an association. It would be useful to conduct brain storming  													discussions, help each other resolve issues related to research  													ethics, train EC members, write on ethics, and strengthen ECs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, speakers at this one-day conference inspired all  													the participants, leaving them with much food for thought.
