				<h4>Made in India? Ethics of outsourcing surrogate
				motherhood to India</h4>
				<p>
					Outsourcing is a commonly used word today. Corporations
					outsource many of their functions and processes to developing
					countries, especially India, to cut costs and improve efficiency.
					Clinical trials were thus outsourced to India, and now it appears
					that children are being produced by outsourcing surrogate
					motherhood to India. Consequently, a new and unique enterprise
					known as "reproductive outsourcing" (also called "reproductive
					tourism") is a rapidly expanding business in India (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gentleman A. India nurtures business of surrogate motherhood. The New York Times. 2008 Mar. [cited 2008 Dec 15].

				<p>
					Many couples living in western countries use Indian surrogate
					mothers to bear their genetically related children <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Johnston J. The ethics of outsourcing motherhood to India. Medscape J Med 2008; 10: 52 [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov" id="3">(3)</a>. The reason
					for using Indian surrogate mothers is obvious: the cost comes to
					about $25,000, roughly a third of the price in the United States.
					That includes the medical procedures, payment to the surrogate
					mother, air tickets and hotel costs for two trips to India-one for
					the fertilisation and a second to collect the baby <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gentleman A. India nurtures business of surrogate motherhood. The New York Times. 2008 Mar. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://www.nytimes.com/12008/03/10/world/asia/10surrogate.html" id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every married couple has a right to have a child and we should
					not scorn the couple that turns to a surrogate mother. But the
					very process of outsourcing surrogate motherhood involves
					many issues and these needs to be addressed while endorsing
					or limiting the procedure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Exploitation of women:</h4>
				<p>
					The requirement of a surrogate
					mother for the procedure raises some apprehensions about the
					exploitation of women. The couple who want the child has to
					find a surrogate mother themselves or they can take the help of
					a law firm or semen bank to do so. These firms can advertise for
					surrogate mothers <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research and National Academy of Medical Sciences. National guidelines for accreditation, supervision and regulation of ART clinics in India. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://www.icmr.nic.in/art/art_clinics.htm" id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Indian context, the involvement of touts in "seeking
					business" cannot be ruled out, and the touts may employ
					dubious methods in this search. So, the question is, "Is it ethical
					to find a surrogate mother in this way?"
				</p>
				<p>
					It is possible that due to poverty or some other reason, family
					members may compel a woman to act as a surrogate mother.
					The women who enrol for such procedures are mainly from a
					poor socio-economic background. The surrogate mother is
					paid by the couple who want the child, and it is possible that
					the mother may not be adequately paid.
				</p>
				<p>
					The guidelines published by the Indian Council of Medical
					Research <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research and National Academy of Medical Sciences. National guidelines for accreditation, supervision and regulation of ART clinics in India. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://www.icmr.nic.in/art/art_clinics.htm" id="4">(4)</a> provide for an agreement between the surrogate
					mother and the couple desiring the child regarding payment.
					But, since we are dealing with often illiterate and powerless
					women, the agreement may not be a fair one. The mandatory
					clauses that are to be included in the agreement are not spelt
					out nor is any specific format provided in the guidelines. In
					the absence of such a requirement, clauses favourable to the
					couple and not the surrogate mother may be incorporated.
				</p>

				<h5>Ethics of the procedure:</h5>
				<p>
					The government is actively promoting
					India as a medical tourism destination, but the exchange of
					money for babies is making many people uncomfortable. There
					are no reliable statistics on how many surrogate births are
					being arranged in India for foreigners, but anecdotal evidence
					suggests a sharp increase <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gentleman A. India nurtures business of surrogate motherhood. The New York Times. 2008 Mar. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from:http:// www.nytimes.com/12008/03/10/world/asia/10surrogate.html" id="1">(1)</a>. Surfing the internet, I have found
					many sites advertising the services of clinics. Is it ethical for
					medical practitioners to advertise in this manner?
				</p>

				<p>
					The conditions or circumstances in which the surrogate
					mothers are kept in the clinics also warrant consideration. In
					Anand, a city in Gujarat where the practice was pioneered
					in India, more than 50 surrogate mothers are pregnant with
					the children of couples from the United States, Britain and
					elsewhere. Fifteen of them live together in a hostel attached to
					a clinic <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gentleman A. India nurtures business of surrogate motherhood. The New York Times. 2008 Mar. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from:http:// www.nytimes.com/12008/03/10/world/asia/10surrogate.html" id="1">(1)</a>. The women are literally being kept in custody. Such
					practices violate basic human rights. In addition, these women
					may suffer mental anguish since the doctor ensures that they
					don't bond with the babies by constantly reminding them that
					the foetuses they are carrying are not theirs <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ramchandran S. India's new outsourcing business - wombs. Online Asia Times 2006 Jun. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://www.atimes.com/atimes/south_asia/hf16df03.html" id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is possible that even basic procedures such as informed
					consent of the mother may not be taken, or may be obtained in
					a questionable manner. Also, considering the money involved,
					the mother may not be inclined to ask the doctor about the
					dangers or risks involved in the pregnancy. Money seems to be
					a crucial factor for many surrogates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important issue that needs attention is what sort of
					protection would be given to the mother in case of prenatal or
					postnatal complications, or if death occurs. If continuing with
					the pregnancy endangers her life, is the mother entitled to
					terminate her pregnancy?
				</p>

				<h5>Interests of the child:</h5>
				<p>
					Other issues that need to be addressed
					include what to do with the child if the couple does not return
					to India to claim it, or refuses to take the child for some reason,
					or the couple dies or they divorce.
				</p>

				<p>
					What happens if the child is born retarded or physically
					challenged? Neither the surrogate mother nor the putative
					parents may want such a baby. Legally, if the couple refuses to
					accept the child, the surrogate mother and her husband are
					obliged to keep the child since it is she who has given birth to
					the child. In divorce cases, who would be entitled to the custody
					of the child? These questions need considerable thought and
					maybe the agreement between the surrogate mother and the
					couple should address these concerns.
				</p>
				<p>
					The phenomenal increase in surrogate pregnancies makes it
					essential that these issues be properly addressed. Regulation
					that addresses these ethical and other issues will ensure that
					parenthood is achieved with dignity and not at the expense of
					any of the people involved.

					help in re-establishing public trust in ethical research. In the
					interest of continuing medical research, some issues such as
					questioning the authenticity of ethically approved clinical trials
					and the use of the RTI Act need further discussion.
				</p>

				<p>
					The ethical conduct of a clinical trial does not end with the
					formulation of a study design and obtaining a signature on an
					informed consent form. Fatal adverse experiences for subjects
					in clinical trials should be scrutinised. But, certainly, there are
					difficulties in establishing the cause of death when interpreting
					the data retrospectively. It is not easy to attribute risk of death
					to the trial drug/vaccine, and it is even more difficult to rule out
					its possible contribution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other confounding factors may play a vital role in determining
					the final outcome. Increased mortality may be attributed to
					the natural course of diseases such as encephalitis, Gaucher
					disease, or advanced HIV/AIDS in the study populations that are
					generally associated with poor outcome. In such circumstances,
					it is highly probable that the control arm might have a higher
					death rate than the treatment arm. Also, we should consider
					the mortality rate among all subjects under trial instead of the
					absolute number of deaths. In a large study, this number may
					not have much impact when compared to the natural outcome
					of the diseases. In addition, death rates in the trial may be
					compared with the rates achieved in other similar reported
					clinical trials in order to rule out any causal relationship of the
					trial drug with mortality.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is ethical to involve infants in trials provided there is minimal
					risk, which is defined as no more risk than can be expected in
					the normal protected environment of the child <a class="reference" href="#section-two_six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Redmon RB. How children can be respected as 'ends' yet still be used as subjects in non-therapeutic research. J Med Ethics 1986; 12: 77-82." id="section-two_6">(6)</a>. If it is found
					that the hypothesis on which the trial is based is beneficial,
					at least half the subjects in a randomised controlled trial may
					benefit while those in the control arm will be no worse off than
					if the research had not been done <a class="reference" href="#section-two_seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Smyth RL, Weindling A M. Research in children: ethical and scientific aspects. Lancet 1999 Sep; 354: SII21-SII24." id="section-two_7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, any breach in ethical conduct of a clinical trial
					should always be evaluated. New rules for clinical trials were
					implemented in 2005 <a class="reference" href="#section-two_eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nundy S, Gulhati CM. A new colonialism? Conducting clinical trials in India. N Engl J Med 2005 Apr 21;352(16):1633-6" id="section-two_8">(8)</a> probably due to the demand from
					multinational drug companies and organisations. It has become
					easier and more cost-effective for western countries to conduct
					clinical trials in India rather than in their own countries, which
					have strict regulations, complicated safety and compensation
					requirements and a smaller study population.
				</p>
				<p>
					India's vast genetically diverse population with plentiful
					research subjects, its favourable economic conditions, cheap
					labour and low infrastructure costs have accelerated the
					process <a class="reference" href="#section-two_eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nundy S, Gulhati CM. A new colonialism? Conducting clinical trials in India. N Engl J Med 2005 Apr 21;352(16):1633-6" id="section-two_8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#section-two_nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shuchman M. Commercializing clinical trials--risks and benefits of the CRO boom. N Engl J Med 2007 Oct 4;357(14):1365-8." id="section-two_9">9)</a>. In addition, a considerable number of trials are
					industry-sponsored trials of pre-approval therapies which
					are largely focused on defining indications and marketing
					strategies. Hence, it becomes of utmost importance to protect
					the most vulnerable subjects in a trial. At the same time, it
					is difficult to judge what constitutes sufficient grounds for
					disqualifying a research investigator from conducting human
					experiments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Randomised Control Trial (RCT), begun in the mid-
					20th century, probably ranks as one of the most important
					milestones in the history of medicine. It is because of RCTs
					conducted over many decades that we are able to use
					a wide variety of safe drugs today. They are among the
					most reproducible and valid forms of research and rely on
					randomisation and unbiased evaluation of outcomes (based on
					placebo controls and "hard outcomes" such as patient death)
					to minimise errors <a class="reference" href="#section-two_ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yusuf S, Collins R, Peto R. Why do we need some large, simple randomized trials? Stats Med 1984 Oct-Dec; 3(4):409-22" id="section-two_10">(10)</a>. RCTs usually have built-in safeguards
					and external oversights and audits, all of which protect against
					serious biases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both doctors and patients are aware that no drug is free
					of adverse effects. Safety and adverse effects are inversely
					related to each other. The degree of balance between the two
					determines further acceptability for human use. We believe
					that most reputable clinical trials investigators, particularly in
					government academic institutions, are careful to ensure the
					integrity and credibility of their work. Moreover, to the best
					of our knowledge, there are virtually no studies which have
					derived information prospectively in individuals who have died
					during clinical trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interrogating honest investigators who are primarily interested
					in expanding knowledge and research may result in undue
					stress, leading to their refusal to conduct future trials. We
					must protect patients enrolled in clinical trials, but we must
					find better ways to protect professionals also. If we do not, the
					progress of medical research in India may come to a standstill,
					particularly in controversial and distressing areas <a class="reference" href="#section-two_eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Craft AW, McIntosh N.
