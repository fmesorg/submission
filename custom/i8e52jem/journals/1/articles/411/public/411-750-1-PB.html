			<h3>Medical ethics in the media</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Usha Raman</h4>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The mass media function both as reflector and a shaper of a
					society's attitudes and values and as such represent a forum within
					which one may understand and influence public opinion. While
					questions of medical ethics may be largely confined to academic
					and scientific spaces, their importance to society at large cannot
					be denied, and how issues of medical ethics play out-if at all-in
					the media could tell us how society understands and processes
					these questions. This paper uses the techniques of framing analysis
					and textual analysis to examine how the print media, represented
					by two major Indian newspapers, cover medical ethics. The study
					looked at all articles related to medical research over a threemonth period (January - March 2007) and considered how the
					story was framed, what were the key threads followed, and the
					dominant themes focused on. The ethical frame is notable by its
					absence, even in articles related to controversial themes such as
					drug research and genetics. Discussion of ethics appears to be
					problematic given the adherence to traditional "news values"
					when covering science and medicine. The research community
					and the media need to pay more attention to explicitly focusing
					on ethics in their interactions.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					In today's culture of pervasive media and commercialism,
					issues related to public policy and civic life have cropped up in
					unexpected ways. At the same time there has been a shrinking
					of spaces for informed public debate and discussion of such
					issues. Most of the discussion is restricted to closed academic
					forums or interest groups. The mass media are therefore
					important as a space where an open society can learn about,
					and possibly engage with, issues that affect life and living.
				</p>
				<p>
					The mass media-newspapers, popular magazines, radio,
					television, and increasingly, the Internet-play a dual role. They
					not only bring information and opinion about different areas
					of social, economic and political activity to the general public,
					they also convey to the policy makers and holders of power a
					sense of public opinion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Science is an important area of activity in any society. It leads
					to knowledge generation, and also feeds the application of
					such knowledge in a manner that affects health, livelihoods,
					education, food, and various other aspects of life. The news
					media are an important determinant of the ethical and legal
					climate within which science is done and scientific "products"
					are constructed and received. While serious disciplinary debate
					no doubt occurs within academic and professional forums,
					those who participate in such debates, and those who make policy decisions relating to the issues of debate, are partly
					socialised by their exposure to the mass media. In this context,
					popular accounts of science do, to some extent, determine the
					direction and content of such debates, particularly on issues
					where a high degree of disciplinary interfacing takes place,
					and the participants come from a variety of specialised areas.
					Moreover, people in an open society need information about
					the issues on which they vote, and are taxed, and the media
					contribute in an important way to maintaining this public
					discourse <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goodman KW. Philosophy as news: Bioethics, journalism and publicpolicy. J Med Philos 1999; 24 (2): 181-200." id="1">(1)</a>. In fact, some have gone so far as to say that the
					news media play a role in "framing the vocabulary" of this
					discourse <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cheshire W P. Human embryo research and the language of moral uncertainty. Am J Bioeth 2004; 4 (1): 1-5." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the media and science have an uneasy if necessary
					relationship. Several scholars have critiqued the nature of
					science coverage in the media <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lievrouw L. Communication and the social representation of scientific knowledge. Critical Studies in Mass Communication 1990 Mar; 7 (1): 1-10." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nelkin D. Selling science: How the press covers science and technology New York: W H Freeman; 1987." id="4">4)</a>, and both journalists
					and scientists acknowledge the problematic nature of this
					relationship, stemming from their different value systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, the media are accused of having an "unquestioning"
					attitude toward science, and often is deliberately celebratory
					of science, sometimes with an obvious "gee whiz" approach
					to coverage. Science is about process and proof, the latter
					taking several months and years, while news is instant, and
					is about drama and heroism. The differing value systems of
					science and news often lead to situations where scientific
					controversies are presented as controversies between people
					and institutions rather than as issues inherent to the nature of
					scientific discovery and development <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Miles S H. Medical ethicists, human curiosities and the new media midway. Am J Bioeth 2004; 4 (3): 39-43." id="5">(5)</a>. Only occasionally is
					the "science" behind the disagreement explained, and process
					information is rarely explicated.
				</p>
				<p>
					These problems are acknowledged by communicators
					of science, and were articulated in the keynote address
					at the ninth conference of the International Network of
					Public Communication of Science and Technology: "Science
					communicators should encourage public debates about
					science and technology, rather than simply tell people about
					the subject...."
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same conference of the American Association for the
					Advancement of Science, Chief Executive Officer Alan I Leshner
					noted: "If research has always been evaluated according
					to the costs/risks-benefits equation, today much of the

					research touches upon issues of core human values and this
					is why society wants to influence science instead of just being
					influenced by it." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leshner A. Remark made at the ninth conference of the International Network of Public Communication of Science and Technology [cited 2007 Nov 1].

				<h4>The newsmedia and bioethics</h4>

				<p>
					Within the broader field of science, bioethics is particularly
					problematic. Ethical issues are by their very nature complex,
					take time to understand and in most cases have no clear
					resolution that can be neatly presented in a 500 or even 1,500
					word article that follows the standard journalistic formula.
				</p>
				<p>
					In general, stories in the mass media focus on events and
					people, and issues tend to be encapsulated within the principle
					of "newsworthiness" and are assessed on the basis of "news
					values" such as timeliness, prominence, proximity, magnitude,
					impact, human interest and conflict. They rely on snappy
					quotes and dramatic descriptions, facts that can be easily
					fitted into the structure of the inverted pyramid or a feature.
					Journalistic culture tends to be ambivalent about ideas, as
					they are more difficult to write about and take up more space
					and few journalists have the skills and understanding to tackle
					ideas competently <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goodman KW. Philosophy as news: Bioethics, journalism and publicpolicy. J Med Philos 1999; 24 (2): 181-200." id="1">(1)</a>. Nevertheless, newspapers do from time
					to time carry stories on ethical dilemmas in science, medicine
					and technology, such as end-of-life issues, genetic engineering,
					organ procurement and transplantation, HIV testing and
					confidentiality, and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the complexity of such issues, and the limitations of the
					news media to deal with them in a manner that could fully
					inform public discourse, it is important first to understand how
					issues of ethics in medical research are presented in the mass
					media, and then to encourage a dialogue between journalists,
					scientists and ethicists about how the media can foster better
					public understanding of these issues. So the questions to ask
					initially are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How does bioethics get covered in the press?</li>
					<li>What are the "frames" and news values applied to such issues?</li>
					<li>What is the level of explanation or exposition offered?</li>
					<li>Who gets quoted and what sorts of quotes are used?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Survey of bioethics coverage in two national
				newspapers</h4>
				<p>
					This paper attempts to answer some of these questions, and to
					arrive at an understanding of how the discourse on bioethics
					plays out in the mass media, through an analysis of relevant
					articles in two major newspapers, The Hindu and The Times of
					India, during a three-month period, from January through
					March 2007. Newspapers were selected over other news media
					partly for reasons of convenience (print being easier to access
					and analyse) but mainly because the print media are generally
					considered to be "media of record" for the purposes of public
					discourse. Newspapers also cover a wider range of topics
					in greater depth than does television, so there is a greater
					chance of complex issues being discussed in print. There is a
					general perception that newspapers are also to be taken more
					seriously, and are less influenced by the commercialisation that
					has seeped into most mass media.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both newspapers selected for this study are large circulation
					papers published from multiple centres in the country. <em>The Times of India</em> is more popular in the western and northern parts of
					the country while <em>The Hindu</em> has a larger readership in the four
					southern states. Both are considered to be papers of record, read
					by the intelligentsia and opinion leaders across the country.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Method of analysis</h4>
				<p>
					A period of three months was earmarked for the study-January
					1, 2007 to March 31, 2007. The newspapers' web archives were
					searched using the Google search engine for articles relating
					to bioethics during this period, using the following key words:
					medical ethics, bioethics, medical research, clinical trials, drug trials,
					stem cell research, genetic research, cloning, and euthanasia. These
					key words were used based on a perusal of the literature, which
					indicated that these were the topics most likely to be covered by
					the media in relation to ethical dilemmas.
				</p>
				<p>
					The search yielded 14 articles that in some manner touched
					upon ethical issues. These articles were downloaded and saved,
					and later analysed following a close reading. The method
					of textual analysis was applied, which involves reading the
					complete text of each article, including the headline and
					photo captions, and noting the presence and content of
					photographs. This method was first utilised prominently by
					the erstwhile Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in
					Birmingham <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hutchinson; Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. Culture, media, language. London; 1980." id="7">(7)</a> and the Glasgow University Media Group <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Glasgow University Media Group Routledge and Kegan Paul. Bad News. 1976; London." id="8">(8)</a> as
					a means of going beyond traditional content analysis of media
					texts. Textual analysis allows the analyst to go beyond merely
					counting elements (words, phrases, combinations of words) in
					an article to looking at the occurrence of certain themes which
					may add up to a "frame" that structures the presentation of the
					content. Textual analysis also provides a means of situating the
					text within the larger media environment and its connections
					with other methods of meaning production in society.
				</p>
				<p>
					The analysis looked at the main theme highlighted in the
					headline, the news values indicated in the lead paragraph,
					the sources used to support the story, and the overall "frame"
					that was applied to present the story. "Framing" is a technique
					that is consciously and unconsciously used by journalists to
					provide a way of making sense of events. Framing tends to
					present the information in the article within a pre-determined
					storyline, thus forcing a limited set of "understandings" of the
					issue. Frames are built by the choice of vocabulary, the order in
					which facts are presented, the people who get quoted and the
					specific quotes that are chosen, and by what key elements are
					included and omitted in the writing.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics&ndash;barely covered!</h4>
				<p>
					During the study period of three months, The Times of India
					carried five stories containing the key words listed above, while
					The Hindu carried nine. On closer examination, it was clear that
					a majority of the articles that had mention of the terms did
					not discuss ethics in any substantive fashion. Most had only a
					passing mention of the ethical aspect of a given issue, such as in
					this article reporting a meeting of stem cell scientists in which
					the reference to ethics was only in the following sentence:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						A public debate in five cities was planned in mid-2007 to
						frame rules and regulations, covering ethics, cGMP (current
						good management practices) in manufacturing and
						laboratory and clinical research....
					</p>
					<p>
						(<em>The Hindu</em>, 'Guidelines being framed to regulate stem cell
						research', January 31, 2007)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Of the nine articles in The Hindu that contained the key
					search terms, only three discussed the issue of ethics in some
					detail, though even here it was more the necessity of debates
					on ethical issues being noted rather than any substantive
					discussion on the issue. This is evident in the following article:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						...so many clinical trials had been coming into India at
						a faster pace, and this necessitated a speedier effort in
						training researchers in good ethical practices with an overall
						objective of protecting the interests of human participants.
						(The Hindu, 'Medical ethics committees to be regulated',
						February 21, 2007)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Three articles in The Hindu discussed the specifics of ethics
					in research and one of these, a weekly review by the Readers'
					Editor, also discussed the reporting of medical research,
					responding to a criticism from a reader who had noted
					that a report in the paper "gives an erroneous impression
					about the disease causation and its incidence". The other two
					articles discussed specific issues such as the need for ethics
					committees in institutes and the potential implications of a
					new brain scanning technology. Seven of the nine articles
					originated from events, where the report of the event was the
					primary focus and the issues arising from the discussion were
					simply mentioned and not followed through in any way either
					with quotes from the sources or informed comment by the
					writer. Two of the stories carried photographs of speakers or of the meeting that had been reported.
				</p>
				<p>
					In <em>The Times of India</em>, which had five stories that contained the
					key terms, ethics received only passing mention in four, including
					one that spoke at length of research in regenerative medicine
					('Eternity code', January 28, 2007), again, only to make the point
					that ethical issues needed to be considered. The one article
					that did deal with an ethical issue in research was related to the
					relationship between pharmaceutical companies and clinicians
					('No foreign jaunts for medical faculty', January 17, 2007).
				</p>
				<p>
					The amount of coverage therefore was quite limited in terms of
					column inches devoted to medical ethics as well as in terms of
					the detail of reportage. Nevertheless, the available reports were
					further analysed to understand the way the issue was framed,
					the kinds of explanations offered (if any), and the range of
					sources quoted.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Reporting ethics-frames without apicture</h4>
				<p>
					As mentioned earlier, very few of the articles dealt specifically
					with ethics, so in a sense ethics itself was never a frame for an
					article. The main news values that applied to the stories that
					were selected for analysis were timeliness (current events
					such as meetings and ministerial/corporate announcements),
					prominence (statements made by eminent scientists or government officials/politicians), human interest (discussion
					of death and immortality, cloning of organs or human
					beings), and conflict (conflicts of interest in doctors endorsing
					pharmaceutical products). Impact, which is an important news
					value that is applied in analytical as well as straight news
					reports of topics such as the budget, disasters and accidents,
					disease outbreaks or the stock market, was less in evidence in
					the science stories that were selected for analysis. Only in three
					stories was possible impact alluded to in the lead, in terms of the
					expected fruits of such research. For instance, an article about
					a meeting on stem cell research in India carried the following
					lead:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						The first international meet in India of scientists engaged
						in stem cell research began here on Monday to take stock
						of the rapid advances being made in this field in the public
						and private sectors. D Balasubramanian, president of the
						Stem Cell Research Forum of India (SCRFI), said stem cells
						and regenerative medicine, though still in the research
						stage, was rapidly moving toward the development of
						effective cures for a host of diseases by targeting the cause
						of the diseases.
					</p>

					<p>
						(<em>The Hindu</em>, 'First international meet in India of stem cell
						scientists begins', January 1, 2007)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					A story that reported a convocation ceremony at MGR Medical
					University carried a lead quoting the vice chancellor of the
					university (therefore having the news values of prominence
					and timeliness) but later in the article noted that "...the quality
					of practice had gone down drastically and medical ethics
					had also lost its relevance in a commercial world" ('Medical
					graduates told to keep up with the latest', The Hindu, January 26,
					2007). So the impact of the sidelining of ethics was mentioned,
					but no more than that.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another article with a second level headline, 'New Bill provides
					for punitive measures, says Deputy Director General, ICMR' (The
					Hindu, February 21, 2007) highlighted the proposal to set up
					ethics committees in all research institutions (news value of
					timeliness), and the rest of the article discussed the need for
					such committees and listed the kinds of issues they would have
					to handle. But beyond a reporting of statements made by the
					ICMR director general, there was no analysis or further detail
					about the impact such committees would have on research, or
					on the participants of research.
				</p>
				<p>
					There appears to be an acknowledgement-in the few instances
					that they are mentioned-that ethics is important and that
					ethical review of research does have an impact, but what this
					impact is and how it affects the direction of research or its
					application is not elaborated. However, in two stories the frame
					was clearly that of the attendant disadvantages of technological
					progress. This is evident in the story on the development of
					a computer-assisted neuro-physiological system that can
					interpret the unique patterns of human brain activity:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Barbara Sahakian, a professor of neuro-physiology
						at Cambridge University, said the rapid advances in
						neuroscience had forced scientists in the field to set up their own neuroethics society to consider the ramifications
						of their research. "Do we want to become a 'Minority Report'
						society where we're preventing crimes that might not
						happen? For some of these techniques, it's just a matter of
						time. It is just another new technology that society has to
						come to terms with and use for the good, but we should
						discuss and debate it now because what we don't want is for
						it to leak into use in court willy nilly without people having
						thought about the consequences".
					</p>
					<p>
						(<em>The Hindu</em>, 'The brain scan that can read people's intentions',
						February 14, 2007)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The other article where ethics was mentioned early on (in the
					lead itself ) and where it continued to be a thread of the report
					was a straight news story reporting the convocation speech at
					a large medical university:
				</p>
				<p>
					As the power of technology grows, ethical responsibility of
					the medical profession will also increase, M S Swaminathan,
					UNESCO Cousteau Chair in Ecotechnology and Chairman of
					M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, said on Friday.
					(<em>The Hindu</em>, 'Call for debate on ethics in medicine', February
					17, 2007)
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to see whether ethics was mentioned, if not as the
					main theme of a story, then as an aspect of a science report, key
					terms such as "stem cell research", "end of life issues", "euthanasia"
					and "clinical trials" were also used to search for articles, along
					with the term "ethics". Most of the articles mentioned earlier in
					this paper (nine in The Hindu and five in The Times of India) that
					contained these terms however did not use ethics as a "frame"
					to discuss any of the issues. As in the news values, the main
					frame used was "topicality", or as in the story entitled "Eternity
					Code", it was celebratory of science.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it came to discussion of medical practice, however, there
					was a little more attention paid to ethics in the stories analysed.
					Those that dealt with events such as convocations and
					meetings did mention, however briefly, that clinicians needed
					to pay attention to ethics of practice. The one article that dealt
					with ethics in medicine in relatively greater detail was a story
					about the practice by pharmaceutical companies of giving
					doctors special favours and gifts to endorse their products:
				</p>
				<p>
					Drug companies have been spending lavishly in sponsoring
					physicians and their spouses on trips to different places for
					educational symposia. Cars are also being given. "We hope
					the medical fraternity by themselves follow the regulations
					in the MCI Act," an official said.
					(The Times of India, 'No foreign jaunts for medical fraternity',
					January 17, 2007)
				</p>
				<p>
					This article was based on a statement made by the president of
					the Indian Medical Association, and while it laid out the code of
					practice and the contraventions by medical practitioners, it did
					not explain the issue or its implications.
				</p>
				<p>
					One article took the form of a narrative that discussed the
					Mental Health Act and its implementation, and the way it played out in the experience of one patient and her family. It
					touched upon the contradictions in the Act and the difficulties
					in applying it evenly to the wide range of mental illness, merely
					alluding to ethical considerations in these observations:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						WHO believes (Resource Book on Mental Health Legislation,
						2005) that two concepts that are central to decisions about
						whether or not a person may make choices concerning
						various issues are "competence" and "capacity". These
						concepts affect treatment decisions in civil and criminal
						cases, and the exercise of civil rights by persons with mental
						disorders.
					</p>
					<p>
						(The Times of India, 'Crazy kiya re', March 14, 2007)
					</p>
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Absent sources: invisible ethicists and participants</h4>
				<p>
					Since the stories selected for analysis were mainly reports
					of events, the sources tended to be speakers at the events;
					there were no additional interviews done to supplement the
					speeches reported. In the two feature stories that went into
					slightly more depth, the sources quoted were scientists from
					within the domain of research. The patients' or service seekers'
					perspective was not represented at all and neither was the
					ethics experts', even in the article that spoke of research aimed
					at extending life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the neuroscience article mentioned earlier, experts in the
					same domain were quoted on the ethical aspects of the
					research in question, and while they did raise critical points, no
					external ethical experts were quoted. Speeches by prominent
					scientists provided an opportunity to delve deeper into
					the issue of ethics, drawing upon a wider range of sources.
					However, these were not utilised further, perhaps due to the
					constraints of time and space. For instance, in the article on the
					nexus between pharmaceutical companies and doctors, only
					one source was clearly quoted (the IMA president) and the
					other source was identified only as "an official".
				</p>
				<p>
					There were no stories that could strictly meet the news value
					of "conflict", which might have necessitated interviews with
					categories of sources other than doctors and policy makers, so
					this may not be a valid criticism of the stories studied. The one
					exception was an argument presented in a column that pitted
					a ministerial statement against a set of facts, highlighting this
					potential conflict in the lead. But even here, there were no
					sources quoted other than the minister who had made the
					original comment that was being refuted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the fact that formal journalistic norms stress the use
					of multiple sources in complex stories, few of the stories used
					more than one source. The sources quoted tended to be the
					"usual suspects"-lead scientists, ministers and vice chancellors,
					and occasionally, heads of departments of medical specialties.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>But it's not news!</h4>
				<p>
					Clearly, ethics does not make news, particularly when the
					ethical issues are not black and white, when there can be no
					"good guys" to pit against the "bad guys", or there is no clear
					controversy involving prominent persons. Research ethics or medical ethics did not get covered in a single editorial during
					this period, or in any major opinion column. The general lack
					of attention to the details of reporting such as using multiple
					sources, representing multiple points of view and different
					levels of hierarchy, that we see in the news media in general,
					also appears to be a problem in science or medical reporting.
				</p>
				<p>
					None of the 14 stories that were analysed were on page 1 or on
					the editorial page, other than the column by the Readers' Editor
					of The Hindu. A majority were local reports relating to local or
					regional institutions or personalities, which appeared on the
					local or regional pages.
				</p>
				<p>
					The newspaper industry, like the rest of the news media,
					operates under a variety of constraints. Perhaps the print
					media are somewhat less constrained by audience ratings and
					advertising demands than are the electronic media, but they
					are constrained nevertheless. There is a general perception that
					readers today are less interested in serious issues and those
					that require some amount of reflection and engagement-and
					education. Journalists fall into patterns of news gathering
					and writing that best suit the demands of deadlines and
					the perceived audience interest. Within this context, issues
					that require "work" to report and to understand are low
					priority-unless they have a clearly understood relationship
					with business and industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any analysis is limited by the time frames it adopts, and this
					may have been the case here as well. Since the news is made
					up almost exclusively these days of event-based stories, with
					features and analysis done as follow-ups to events, it is likely
					that there was a lack of ethics coverage because there were
					no events that could be seen within an ethical frame. Ethics
					related to medico-scientific issues such as drug discovery
					and production, cloning and regenerative medicine, may not
					have found mention in the newspapers during this study
					period because there were no major conferences, or big
					announcements in the same period. A longer-term analysis, over
					a time frame of a year, perhaps, would yield a clearer picture.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>So do we need to report ethics?</h4>
				<p>
					Discussion of ethics requires not only an understanding of the science in question, but also of the complexity of roles played
					by science and scientists in society and culture. Questions of
					ethics are not always obvious; they may become apparent
					only in the breach or only when it becomes too late to address
					them. Genetic research, for instance, is far ahead of the ability to counsel and to clearly articulate the ramifications of its applications. This is partly because individuals and communities have not been prepared with information or sensitised to the possible ways in which scientific developments may affect their lives. It is also because researchers tend to pay attention to only the scientific aspects of developments and their advantages and downplay the disadvantages-for a variety of professional and financial reasons. Institutional review boards and ethics sub-committees are an attempt to balance the human and materials costs and benefits of science, but often the questions that are raised and answered within these committees do not
					reach wider audiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					More than ever before, science impinges on day-to-day life
					and the direction taken by research decides the nature of
					development. Some of the critical issues that also have a
					significant ethical component are: the development and use of
					genetically modified food and crops, human tissue engineering
					and regenerative medicine, drug discovery and clinical trials,
					and several other areas of genetic and bio-medical engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					Biotechnology research is considered to be particularly
					important in terms of its ethical implications, because of the
					commercial potential of the industry. In 2005, the industry
					was estimated at more than USD 50.3 billion <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="www.bio.org, accessed 2007 Nov 10." id="9">(9)</a>. This includes
					the harvesting and sale of human tissues, pharmaceutical and
					cosmetic products derived from human and animal materials,
					and several other application areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we believe that governance cannot be left entirely to the
					"specialists" that is, the politicians and the bureaucrats, and
					that an informed citizenry not only ensures good governance
					but in fact demands it, then by extension, the administration
					and application of science cannot be left entirely to those
					within the scientific establishment. A scientifically literate and
					sensitive public will participate in debates about the use of
					scientific research, and perhaps encourage responsible use of
					the products of science <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharpe V. Science, bioethics and the public interest: on the need for transparency. Hastings Cent Rep 2002 May-Jun; 32 (3): 23-26." id="10">(10)</a>. Ethics plays a crucial role in this
					debate. Important questions that stem from or inform ethical
					decisions include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How much money is being spent on this research?</li>
					<li>What are the areas this research will affect?</li>
					<li>What will it take away from what we have?
</li>
					<li>How will it contribute to what we have?</li>
					<li>Who will it benefit and how?</li>
					<li>What cannot be done as a result of placing resources in this area?</li>
					<li>What will we have to do to make the products of this
							research available to all?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					These are questions that science does not always ask of itself.
					If the press is to continue to be an important intermediary
					between the public, academia, industry and other power
					structures, then the press must be a site for informed debate
					on issues of science and the ethics of science.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several newspapers in the West have an "ethics" beat, and there
					are journalists whose business it is to routinely cover research in
					all its aspects because there is a high level of consciousness that
					public monies are being spent on these activities and therefore
					those who engage in them have to be publicly accountable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Newspapers in India would do well to give some interested
					journalists the time and resources to cover science ethics on
					a regular basis, particularly ethical implications of medical
					research and service delivery. The medical and scientific
					establishment, too, would do well to interact with the media on
					a more regular basis, holding public discussions on the potential
					implications of research before it is translated into products or
					applications. They need to understand how the media works how to position and present stories so that they fit the values
					and frames that the news media hold primary. If there is a
					healthy and involved dialogue among the public, the media and
					the science /medical establishment, then questions of ethics will naturally find their way into the pages of the press.
