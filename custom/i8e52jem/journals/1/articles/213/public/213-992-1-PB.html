			<h3>Newer vaccines in the Universal Immunisation Programme </h3>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Vaccines are important preventive medicines for primary healthcare and critical for a nation's health security. In India the Universal Programme of Immunization (UPI), launched in 1985, included six childhood vaccines. A well thought out immunisation schedule must be epidemiologically relevant to the country's health status, covering only diseases that are public health problems and for which effective vaccines are available. There has been pressure from the drug industry to include all newly developed vaccines in the government's UIP, even though the clinical and epidemiological justification for their inclusion is debated. Many developed countries have included several other new vaccines in their regular immunisation programmes. These trends are used as a justification by the industry to include these vaccines in the Indian UIP in the future. All these vaccines need not, and cannot, be given universally. This paper looks at some vaccines which are newly included in the UIP schedule, or which may be included in the near future.

The World Health Organization (WHO)'s policy under its Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI), in line with the call for &quot;Health for All by 2000&quot;, recommended universal immunisation of all children against six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) to reduce child mortality. The EPI was launched in India in January 1978 with the objective of (i) reducing mortality and morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood and (ii) achieving self sufficiency in the production of vaccines <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Park K, editor.

				<h4>Universal Programme of Immunization</h4>
				<p>
					A revised version of the EPI, the Universal Programme of Immunization (UPI), was launched on November 15, 1985 and included vaccines for six diseases, namely tuberculosis, paralytic polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and measles, all of which have a major impact in India <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Park K, editor. Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine. 19th ed. Jabalpur: M/s Banrarsidas Bhanot Publishers; 2007. p. 105-6." id="2">(2)</a>. The typhoid vaccine, which is of low efficacy, was replaced by the measles vaccine, which is of much greater relevance for India. The National Health Policy, 1983, set the goal of universal immunisation by 2000 but this has not been achieved <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapter 2.8 : Human and Social developments. In: Government of India. Planning Commission. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-2007. New Delhi: Planning Commision; 2002." id="3">(3)</a>. As per data from the National Family Health Survey-III (2005-06), UIP coverage countrywide was just 44% compared to 36% (1992-93) and 42% (1998-99) in previous surveys. Even in Kerala, coverage had actually declined to 75% from 80% (1998-99) <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences, Macro International. National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3), 2005-06, India; Key findings. Mumbai: IIPS. 2007 Sep Vol 1." id="4">(4)</a>. The Ministry of Health in its 10th Plan document pointed out that one of the main reasons for this failure was the focus on the campaign mode of programmes in health <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapter 2.8 : Human and Social developments. In: Government of India. Planning Commission. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-2007. New Delhi: Planning Commision; 2002." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every country has its own immunisation schedule according to what is operationally feasible and socially acceptable <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Park K, editor. Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine. 19th ed. Jabalpur: M/s Banrarsidas Bhanot Publishers; 2007. p. 105-6." id="2">(2)</a>. A well thought-out immunisation schedule must be epidemiologically relevant to the country's health status and should include only diseases or public health problems for which effective vaccines are available. The vaccines should be immunologically effective and should be given at the right time at appropriate intervals to give maximum protection <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Park K, editor. Park's textbook of preventive and social medicine. 19th ed. Jabalpur: M/s Banrarsidas Bhanot Publishers; 2007. p. 105-6." id="2">(2)</a>. The United States does not include the BCG vaccine since tuberculosis is not a major problem there. The United Arab Emirates includes the meningococcal vaccine since it is a problem there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although international agencies such as the WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) promote global immunisation drives and policies, the success of an immunisation programme in any country depends more upon local realities and national policies. This is particularly true for a huge and diverse developing country such as India, with its population of more than 1 billion people, and 25 million new births every year <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The methods used by economically well-off nations to gain control over poor countries by accessing their markets and creating a demand for medical technologies including vaccines, irrespective of local needs, have been documented extensively. As a new product is being readied, research is published to highlight the number of deaths in the country caused due to the absence of that vaccine <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit? Indian J Med Research. 2008 Jan;127: 1-3." id="5">(5)</a> The term &quot;public-private partnerships&quot; disguises the role of the pharmaceutical company in such research <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit? Indian J Med Research. 2008 Jan;127: 1-3." id="5">(5)</a>. Many western countries have added several new vaccines to their regular immunisation programmes. These include vaccines for influenza type B, meningitis, chickenpox and a single vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). In the last case, our national programme includes only the measles vaccine; the MMR vaccine is costly, marketed by private firms and an optional vaccine in India. These trends are used as a justification by the industry to lobby for inclusion of these vaccines in the Indian UIP <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>. Aggressive promotional campaigns for the new vaccines, and their quick adoption by industry-friendly private medical practitioners, have already made these vaccines akin to fast-moving consumer goods. The industry, which enjoys all the benefits of economic liberalisation, sees no contradiction in seeking a captive market for its new vaccines through the government-sponsored UIP while at the same time failing to meet its social responsibility <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>.

					Since the formation of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) in 1999, as an international coalition of multiple funding agencies with vaccine manufacturers and non government organisations, the global promotions of vaccinations are decided by GAVI <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Immunization 2005-2006. 4th ed. Mumbai: IAP; 2007 Jan." id="6">(6)</a>. Pharmaceutical companies promote their agendas by funding or otherwise gaining influence over such agencies <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit? Indian J Med Research. 2008 Jan;127: 1-3." id="5">(5)</a>. Based on the WHO-UNICEF scoring system to determine vaccine priority, the following vaccines were recently included in the list as high priority vaccines: pentavalent vaccines (DTP-hepatitis B-Hib), mumps, measles, rubella vaccines (MMR), the rotavirus vaccine, pneumococcal vaccines, and injectable and monovalent oral polio vaccines(the polio vaccine is usually against all three strains but the monovalent vaccine is against type 1 strain). Most of these are either combined vaccines (UIP + non UIP vaccines) or pipeline vaccines, in the last stage of clinical trials or in the queue for marketing <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y. Vaccine PSUs: chronicle of an attenuation willfully caused. MFC Bull. 2008 Jun-Jul; 329: 1-7." id="7">(7)</a>. The combined vaccines are costlier than single vaccines and they almost never have more efficacy than single vaccines <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Immunization 2005-2006. 4th ed.

Indian Pediatrics. 2002; 39: 787-8." id="8">8</a>). The tendency to combine EPI vaccines with non-EPI vaccines not only creates an artificial scarcity for affordable EPI vaccines, it also creates a backdoor method for the entry of expensive and perhaps unnecessary non-EPI vaccines into the universal immunisation programme <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit? Indian J Med Research. 2008 Jan;127: 1-3." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rapid growth (8%-10% per annum) of India's current human vaccine market is mainly attributed to the new, high-priced vaccines <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Phadke A, Kale A. Some critical issues in the epidemiology of Hepatitis-B in India. Indian J Gastroenterol. 2000.19:c76-c77 Suppl 3" id="9">(9)</a>. There has been pressure from the vaccine industry to include these new vaccines in the government's UIP even though the clinical and epidemiological justification for their inclusion is controversial <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Phadke A, Kale A.

				</p>
				<p>
					For every new drug invented, genomics and bioinformatics are used to customise it to suit different populations. But in vaccines, the tendency is to move toward a &quot;one vaccine fits all&quot; regime <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>. Though there were no attempts to conclusively establish that the imported vaccines actually suited the Indian strains of the pathogens, these vaccines were adopted. Also, the undue emphasis on the statistics of vaccine &quot;coverage&quot;, rather than the immune protection achieved, makes it seem that spending money on vaccines is more important than actual disease prevention <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>.

					The government of India does not have access to quality data and high quality expert advice. Even those with expertise on the matter do not tread an independent path, fearing the wrath of their international donors <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ipin M Vashishta; The nexus and the ills afflicting the vaccination practices Indian J Med Res. 2008 May; 127: 502-3." id="10">(10)</a>. Immunisation matters are left to manufacturers and international organisations, to &quot;guide&quot; and decide what is to be introduced in our market. Governments and academic associations remain mute spectators. Hence, broadly speaking, two nexuses are operating at present -- one between international health agencies and the government, and another between vaccine companies and academic associations. The former has far-reaching consequences on public health while the latter chiefly affects the practices of the private sector <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ipin M Vashishta; The nexus and the ills afflicting the vaccination practices Indian J Med Res. 2008 May; 127: 502-3." id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A major flaw is in the approach to vaccines, which most of the time is &quot;vaccine-targeted&quot; and not &quot;disease-targeted&quot;. This flaw is more glaring at a time of resource scarcity when our government is spending merely one per cent of its gross domestic product on health <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ipin M Vashishta; The nexus and the ills afflicting the vaccination practices Indian J Med Res. 2008 May; 127: 502-3." id="10">(10)</a>. The Ministry of Health also planned to include new vaccines by charging the actual costs from people above the poverty line <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapter 2.8 : Human and Social developments. In: Government of India. Planning Commission. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-2007. New Delhi: Planning Commision; 2002." id="3">(3)</a>. With epidemiology taking a backseat, government decisions on vaccination are increasingly determined by price competition and supply &quot;push&quot; (by the companies) rather than &quot;pull&quot; (demand) from proven public health needs <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Phadke A, Kale A.

				<h4>Self sufficiency in UIP vaccines</h4>
				<p>
					The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) procures and supplies vaccines for the EPI, and provides logistics and cold chain support to the states <a class="reference" href="#elevan" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sunderlal, Adersh, Pankaj. Textbook of community medicine. 1st edition New Delhi and Bangalore: CBS Publishers and Distributers: 2007. ISBN: 81-239-1441-5" id="11">(11)</a>. Over the last few decades, due to the decline of the public sector and the growing disinterest of the private sector in vaccines, the number of firms supplying EPI vaccines has declined drastically, both in India and abroad. Private manufacturers prefer to sell them as &quot;value-added cocktail vaccines&quot; at exorbitant prices in the open market, rather than supply to the EPI <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit? Indian J Med Research. 2008 Jan;127: 1-3." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaccine requirements for India's EPI have been met mainly through the public sector's vaccine institutions, as was the case in most parts of the world until the 1980s. However, the Indian public sector failed to introduce new technologies of production (such as for production of tetanus toxoid, Diphtheria Tetanus, or DPT-Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus) or to expand production to become self-reliant in producing the oral polio vaccine or the measles vaccine. In some cases, indigenously manufactured vaccines were stopped in favour of imported vaccines <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shortages of primary vaccines in developing countries began to emerge in the late 1990s due to the introduction of new, more sophisticated and more expensive vaccines in industrialised country markets, leading to manufacturers phasing out the production of the traditional, less expensive vaccines used in developing countries. Between 1998 and 2001, 10 of 14 major manufacturers partly or completely stopped production of traditional vaccines. The outcome of these developments is that the availability of primary vaccines has decreased dramatically, while their prices have increased <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y Vaccine policy in India. PLoS Med. 2005 May. 2(5): e127. Epub 2005 May 31." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indigenous efforts to achieve vaccine self sufficiency were jeopardised in January 2008 with the closing down of three public sector units (PSUs) by the MOHFW on the excuse that these units did not comply with the WHO's good manufacturing practices <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y.

As a result, during the year 2009-10, between 25% and 100% of various UIP vaccines had to be procured from private companies. The difference between requirement and supply ranged from 137 lakh doses for the BCG vaccine to 409 lakh doses for the DPT vaccine. Even before the closure of PSUs, UIP vaccines were not available to millions of children born in India, and information obtained under the Right to Information Act gave clear evidence of the impact of reduced coverage <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dutta AG.

Following the closure of public sector vaccine manufacturing units in India, UNICEF announced a Rs 143 crore award to Panacea Biotec, a private manufacturing unit in India, for its pentavalent vaccine &quot;EasyFive&quot; for supply to the whole country for the years 2008-9. <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Panacea Biotec.

UNICEF's actions facilitated the promotion of the pentavalent vaccine in the country.

					There are many instances of interested parties exaggerating the prevalence of Hepatitis B in order to promote the vaccine. The Indian Association of Pediatrics (IAP) which promote these vaccines quotes an article by Thyagarajan et al which estimates the prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B infection in India to be 1.77% by aggregating data from available, published studies in India by different researchers and averaging (8,21). The article is based on a national seminar sponsored by SmithKlineBeecham which markets the Hepatitis B vaccine <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thyagarajan SP,.Jayaram S, Mohanvalli B.

					Considering the low prevalence of Hepatitis B, and the resource constraints, this vaccine should be limited to babies born to Hepatitis B + mothers. For this purpose, all pregnant women should undergo testing for Hepatitis B as part of the other tests for anaemia and blood grouping. This does not require any additional effort or equipment and the test kit can be bought in bulk by the government for, say, Rs 15-20 <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Universal Hepatitis B vaccination.

					Advocating universal vaccination with Hib, irrespective of an individual country's disease burden and the natural immunity attained within the country against the disease, and not taking into account the rights of sovereign states to decide how to prioritise use of their limited health resources, is an example of the top-down approach of global organisations like the WHO <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel JM, Madhavi Y.Vaccines: policy for public good or private profit?

				</p>
				<p>
					Women acquiring rubella in the first trimester of pregnancy can pass the infection to the foetus, resulting in the newborn being born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

Mumbai: IAP; 2007 Jan." id="6">(6)</a>. For countries wishing to prevent the occurrence of congenital rubella infection including CRS, two approaches are recommended by the WHO : (a) prevention of CRS only, through immunisation of adolescent girls and/or women of childbearing age; or (b) elimination of rubella as well as CRS through universal vaccination of infants, surveillance and assuring immunity in women of childbearing age <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="[No authors listed].

				</p>
				<p>
					In a country like India where the vaccination coverage is below 44%, a strategy of limiting the use of the rubella vaccine to women of childbearing age who are not immune to the virus is essentially free of the risk of altering rubella transmission dynamics, whereas inadequately implemented childhood vaccination runs the risk of increasing the number of adults, including women of childbearing age, susceptible to infection and therefore the possibility of increased numbers of cases of CRS <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="[No authors listed].

				</p>
				<p>
					Haphazard use of the rubella vaccine in young children through public health measures with suboptimal coverage of the target population may be counterproductive as it may shift the epidemiology of rubella with an increase in the number of cases occurring in young adults leading to paradoxical increase of CRS <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Committee on Immunization 2005-2006. 4th ed.

				</p>
				<p>
					Rubella vaccines for childhood immunisation as used in the private sector where rubella is not a formal part of the immunisation programmes can affect transmission dynamics and increase susceptibility in women of childbearing age, as recently demonstrated in Greece and in some Latin American countries <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="[No authors listed].

					In India the measles vaccine is already given in the UIP at the age of 9-12 months and the combined mumps-measles-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given at the age of 15 months as an optional vaccine in the private sector.

These unhealthy nexus between WHO and the vaccine industry, we fear will have far reaching negative influence on the lives of millions of children all over the world...<strong> for every four children in whom pneumonia is prevented, two children develop asthma because of the vaccine.</strong> Pneumonia is a mild infection treated with antibacterial agent (Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim) at less than $1 per child, according to the WHO protocol. Asthma on the other hand is often permanent and needs repeated inhaled treatment with bronco-dilators and steroids. Asthma is a condition much worse than the one-off pneumonia which is easily treated and cured...

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					India must evolve its own national strategies to meet its vaccination needs within its budgetary constraints. The suitability of imported vaccines to deal with Indian pathogenic strains also needs to be conclusively established wherever necessary. The health security of a nation of India's size cannot be left to the vagaries of global market forces. By reviving the production of closed PSUs, India can even play a major role in meeting the global shortfall in the vaccines procured by UNICEF.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, India needs to strengthen its disease surveillance system. This would help to decide between universal or selective immunisation based on unequivocal scientific evidence. It would also help us respond to the changing disease prevalence scenario on the ground, which may call for a move from universal to selective immunisation or vice versa.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, a strong emphasis on in-house research and development is needed in order to ensure that our production technologies are in tune with the times, and in order to negotiate strategic partnerships with outside scientists or institutions and companies.
