				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					There is little data in India on the use of performance enhancing  														drugs in sports. But personal and incidental information shows  														that their use is far more extensive than is believed. This use occurs  														beyond the arena of high-level competitive sports. Even if the  														guidelines of the national and world anti-doping agencies were to  														become effective, they would not impact the larger environment  														where such drug use appears to be extensive. Which ethical  														guidelines advise the sports medical practitioner in prescribing  														medicines and training regimes for the athlete? Of particular  														concern is the role of paediatricians since training for sports or  														physical fitness is increasingly a youth phenomenon. The following  														is a discussion note, prompted by personal and anecdotal  														experience.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Some years ago, after India organised a triumphant  														Commonwealth Games, three top medal-winning athletes  														tested positive for drugs. The news prompted an avalanche of  														information and revelations. First, the athletes all vehemently  														denied having taken performance-enhancing banned drugs  														(PEDs) of any kind."Am I mad?" asked one of them,"Would  														I knowingly take something that would have me banned  														from competitions in my peak years?" Others said that they  														dutifully took anything that the coach prescribed, adhering  														completely to all training requirements. The fact that the team  														had a foreign coach, whose training methods may have been  														different and who had not been fully accepted by the Indian  														coaching circles, made it easy for everyone to happily shift the  														blame.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were also those who pointed out that the athletes had,  														after all, been under the supervision of consulting doctors  														throughout. How was it that the medical consultants had not  														discovered the use of drugs among these participants? Worse,  														had they in fact known of it and kept quiet?
				</p>
				<p>
					A number of questions have been posed in the media and in  														sporting circles: Was this a result of poor testing procedures?  														Were the athletes as innocent as they said they were? Were the  														coaches or designated doctors at fault? But hovering above all  														this, and mostly unarticulated, are these other questions: Was  														this an aberration or is this just the tip of the iceberg? Do these  														results indicate that use of PEDs is far more prevalent then we  														know? And if this is so, what is the social psychology of PED  														use?
				</p>
				<p>
					Most young athletes know, by their early teens, that there  														are drugs that enhance performance and that some of their  														competitors do take them."Locker room" talk at many of   theathletic meets that I participated in at school, almost always  														had gossip about how some girl or other was regularly   taking  														PEDs. Girls would suddenly have gained mass and muscle in  														less than 10 months; young athletes would boast that their  														coach had"given them something" at the medical post   before  														their major events; and I realised why some school coaches   and  														'guardians and sports chaperones' would not let their   students  														mingle with others. There was never any educational   literature  														on it from the games authorities; the doctor attending   hushed  														and shooed me away when I innocently asked if I could have  														that something that helped me run better! This isn't to   detract  														from really talented sportspeople out there; but every   serious  														school athlete learns quickly to ignore all this and never  														mention it to anyone.

In this context, is there enough concern among  														healthcare practitioners about this phenomenon given the  														growing community of athletes, as well as the casual athlete,  														the physical culture freak and the sporting fan? As Sigman asks,  														"Are we all dopes?" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sigman S M. Are we all dopes?

				<p>
					Many sports medicine practitioners deal with young people,  														even children. What kind of ethical framework do they use?  														What is the responsibility of the medical profession in all this?  														There is a special need for open discussion on the ethics of PED  														use and on the ethics of banning PED in general; and of the role  														of physicians, pharmacists and hospitals in sports in relation to  														India.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the setting up of the National Anti-Doping Agency  														(NADA), athletic organisations have been expecting a  														comprehensive anti-doping policy that includes not only  														measures to detect and curb their use but also to promote  														the spread of information and educational programmes.  														Unfortunately, the measures focus more on detection than on  														understanding drug use and the role of the many stakeholders.  														Nor do they describe the role a medical expert should play in  														achieving a dope-free sports world.
				</p>
				<p>
					What ethical guidelines regulate the interaction between  														athlete and doctor? How do practitioners negotiate their  														responsibility to prepare athletes to win and also keep them  														safe, healthy and secure?
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The context</h4>
				<p>
					Briefly, there are two socio-economic layers among those  														who pursue sports: One, a large section of the population,  														particularly first generation learners, for whom sports is  														proving to be a key alternative career; a faster track than the  														conventional education-employment route. Many government  														and private companies provide preferential employment  														opportunities for winning sportsmen and women. But the  														opportunity cake is small and there are many competitors.  														So winning, even at that school level competition, is all  														important. Second, sports also presents a means of achieving  														quick fame and fortune, if one is lucky and clever enough to  														deliver superior performance in certain sports. Third, in a bid  														to encourage sports, the government has sought to recognise  														sporting prowess by awarding special concessions, often  														in terms of additional grades or marks for admission into  														institutions of higher learning. This means that a win at school,  														college or district level competition is a stepping stone even to  														an academic career.
				</p>
				<p>
					At another level, parents in the rising middle class are   an  														expanding market for"health supplements" that will   enhance  														children's sporting and/or academic reach. With this has   arrived  														the huge market for supplements and drugs of every kind   that  														give one an edge over others in every kind of competition  														and not just in sports: vitamins, growth supplements (the  														much discussed anabolic steroids), supplements for   increasing  														muscle strength, others for keeping kids alert for their   work  														days packed with studies and sports. That some of these  														include steroids and other harmful preparations is hardly  														surprising. Inevitably parents too fall into the trap of  "anything  														goes" to achieve success in life, academic or sporting.   And they  														fall prey to coaches and clubs that push athletes to the   extreme  														in the name of"producing world class athletes" for say,   the  														2016 Olympics, and so on. On the one hand, there is a   growing  														interest in sports and participation in sports is becoming  														more acceptable than it was in many circles in the   previous  														generation. On the other, the interest is distorted and a   win-at-all-costs attitude may be leading to problems later. The medical  														profession can play an important role in restoring the   ethical  														balance.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is little education on drugs of any kind, and even less on  														banned drugs, for athletes. NADA under the world anti-doping  														body has yet to get its act together. A poor pharmaceutical  														regulatory system allows the marketing of drugs and  														 ;supplements ; that are banned or have been withdrawn in  														many other countries. A growing non-regulated market for  														physical culture and"fitness" outlets just encourages this.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are complex ethical issues emerging in our country in  														the field of sports and medical practice and I am not sure that  														anybody is addressing these in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The International Federation of Sports Medicine (FIMS) has an  														elaborate code of ethics <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Renstrom PAFH, Frontera WD, Parker AJ, Wesseling JBM. Code of ethics of the International Federation of Sports Medicine (FIMS) [Internet]. Lausanne: FIMS; [date unknown, cited 2013 Mar 15]. Available from: http://www.fims.org/content/assets/documents/FIMSCodeOfEthics.pdf" id="2">(2)</a> that lays down guidelines on the  														behaviour of doctors practising sports medicine. I have   seen  														no comparable code in India. The Indian Association of   Sports  														Medicine does not appear to have a code of ethics; or at   least it is not freely available. It is not on their website where it   should  														be. Surprisingly even the constitution of the Association <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Constitution of the Indian Association of Sports Medicine [Internet]. Amritsar: IASM;2003 Dec 6 [cited 2013 Mar 15]. Available from: http://www.iasm.co.in/constitution.html" id="3">(3)</a> does not list ensuring ethical practice as a part of its objectives.  														The World Anti-doping Code does not offer specific guidelines  														for the behaviour of medical practitioners <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Anti-Doping Agency. World Anti-Doping Code [Internet] 2009. Available from: http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_en.pdf " id="4">(4)</a>. Nor does NADA.  														Even if NADA were to become more proactive on drug use  														in sports, it would still leave a huge arena where drug use for  														enhancement of performance is common. This can only be  														addressed by the medical profession, who as paediatricians or  														orthopaedic doctors, or school doctors are playing a critical  														role in determining drug use of all kinds.*
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>"Drugs" and their uses</h4>
				<p>
					PED use is not only found in competitive sports. It also occurs  														in arenas that are less covered by any kind of code of sports  														practice. For instance, let us take the use of protein"stackers ;.  														These are specifically designed proteins that are used with high  														weight training. Lifting excessive weights pushes the body to  														the limit, making the muscles break down."Stackers" build on  														top of muscle tears instead of fixing the broken striations and  														assisting in repair. This produces layer upon layer of muscle.  														These are widely prescribed ask any"body builder" in your  														neighbourhood, or go to any"sports supplement ; store and  														not only to athletes. And doctors prescribe them too.
				</p>
				<p>
					The FIMS code says:"The sports medicine physician should  														oppose and in practice refrain from using methods to improve  														performance artificially such as those prohibited by the IOC. Does this code apply in India?"
				</p>
				<p>
					All PEDs are best used in association with a specific training  														regimen. For instance, your neighbourhood gym trainer will  														prescribe ingestion of whey as a means of building up the body  														and losing fat. Also prescribed with their regular ingestion will  														be a certain level of exercise. But the trainer may neglect to tell  														the sports enthusiast that that without a certain high level of  														exercise, whey (or its equivalent) may be at worst, harmful or at  														best, plain useless.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are the much-debated anabolic steroids. In the past,  														athletes have tested positive for pseudo epinephrine and  														were stripped of their medals. Pseudo epinephrine is in most  														common cough and cold medications as an antagonist to  														antihistamines and as an anti-inflammatory. However, it is  														banned because pseudo epinephrine gives you an immediate  														faux energy boost. Naturally occurring epinephrine in the body  														triggers the brain's motivation (reward) response and makes  														the user feel elated, energetic, confident and motivated to  														succeed. Pseudo epinephrine, as the name suggests, mimics the  														effects of epinephrine but only at the bodily level, providing  														the athlete similar advantages. This is why PSE is a banned drug  														in elite sport.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should doctors who know that their patients are using some  														of these drugs and supplements provide them with advice?   Is  														it their ethical duty to discourage the dangerous use of   such  														supplements? According to the FIMS and the World   Anti-Doping Association codes it is the duty of medical practitioners to   advise patients against the dangerous use of supplements  														when they know that they are being used. How do doctors in  														India respond to these situations?
				</p>
				<p>
					Elite athletes also undergo surgeries and they may be not  														just for high-end repair of injuries but also corrections that  														enhance performance. With this comes an accompaniment  														of drugs. I have no idea how prevalent these surgeries are in  														India; but going by the ads for liposuction, breast reduction  														and enhancement and so on, would PE surgeries be far away?  														What ethical norms govern these surgeries? Would the medical  														profession only advise patients against them if sporting  														authorities have banned them? Or would they use a different  														ethical compass that places athletes at the centre of concern?
				</p>
				<p>
					Where does ethics play a role in determining the training  														(including nutrition and supplement and drug regimen) of  														athletes? By the FIMS code doctors are even supposed to  														 ;oppose training and practices and competition rules as they  														may jeopardize the health of the athlete ;. So then, what kind  														of training or equipment should be regarded as ethically  														questionable?
				</p>
				<p>
					And then there are the day-to-day issues. Anecdotally, there  														is a sharp spurt in the use of all kinds of supplements for  														children and adolescents. Internationally, since the 1990s there  														is a huge highly profitable supplement industry producing  														a variety of products for those who want to bulk up, lose  														weight, grow taller, develop larger muscles, have better limb  														strength, enhance attention span, not to mention products that  														postpone periods, reduce breast growth, etc. Some of these are  														suggested to adolescents who may not even be aiming at a  														sports career.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the FIMS code doctors have special  														responsibilities with regard to young athletes. This would  														mean that doctors, especially paediatricians, have a particular  														and additional responsibility to ensure that young athletes do  														not use performance enhancing substances and are not led  														into using them by coaches and trainers. And yet, how many  														paediatricians will discourage the use of growth supplements  														of one kind or another by parents ambitious for their children?  														Even if they don't prescribe them, how many will educate  														parents on this issue? However, one paediatrician cannot make  														an ethical stand. As a paediatrician, among those who strongly  														disliked and discouraged any kind of supplements, pointed  														out in a personal interview,"I may discourage them, refuse to  														advocate them. But they don't need a prescription; and there  														are any number of other doctors who will lead (young athletes)  														to (these drugs)." <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prakash K.;You want to win, don't you?: Critical need for a psychology of PED use in developing countries [Internet]. Paper presented at: Play the Game Conference; 2011; Cologne, Germany. Available from: http://www.playthegame.org/fileadmin/image/PTG2011/Presentation/prakash_kaveri_-critical_need.pdf" id="5">(5)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, children in any kind of athletic activity are positively  														encouraged to use 'harmless' over-the-counter supplements.  														This creates a mindset that enhancing performance in sports  														through the use of drugs is perfectly acceptable, as long as it  														has no immediate impact on health. Once they start on this  														first stage of PED use, why not others? Who is to tell them  														differently? Is it not the ethical responsibility of doctors and  														pharmacists to discourage this use and educate parents and  														children about the fact that this is misuse?
				</p>
				<p>
					The easy way out is to point to the fact that monitoring ethical  														training and drug use is in the realm of sports authorities.  														Unfortunately, and increasingly, the medical profession, and  														not just sports practitioners, is touched by what happens in  														the sports field. Hospitals and doctors are important points of  														reference to anyone who is into sports and it is here that they  														may learn the difference between safe supplements and unsafe  														PEDs. It is here that they come to resolve the problems that these  														drugs or training regimes might cause. So it is here that they are  														most in need of ethical, sound and well-grounded advice.
				</p>
				<p>
					This note has more questions than answers. But it is high time  														that these questions were discussed. The lack of some kind of  														monitoring and education on the use of PEDs may be harming  														a whole generation of sportspeople, both competitive and  														recreational sports enthusiasts and practitioners. As Sigman  														points out,"the unidentified and unquantified yet prevalent  														use of PEDs and other doping methods has changed the way  														in which we understand elite human achievement and how we  														relate to that, and it has changed us for the worse." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sigman S M. Are we all dopes? A behavioral law and economics approach to legal regulation of doping in sports [Internet]. Marq Sports L Rev. 2008 Fall;19(1):125-208. Available from: http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/sportslaw/vol19/iss1/7/" id="1">(1) </a>. Running  														down that track, shooting a goal, or batting a sixer are hugely  														exciting; but we need to restore a balance with an ethics check  														perhaps to make it accessible and safe for all.
