				<h4>Ben Goldacre. Bad Pharma. London: Fourth Estate; 2012. Pp 448 paperback. ISBN978-0-00-750955-3 Rs 499.00</h4>
				<p>
					I had read Dr Ben Goldacre's earlier book <em>Bad Science</em>, an
					excellent description of scientific methods, their use and
					misuse; but had hesitated to buy<em> Bad Pharma</em> when I first saw
					it in bookshops. This was because I thought I already knew
					all about the shenanigans of the pharma companies, and
					that this book would only reiterate what other authors had
					recorded. I was wrong. There is a whole lot of information
					here which is new to me and probably will be to you as well.
					In Ben Goldacre's clear prose, the serious problems underlying
					the scientific practice of medicine are well exposed. It may
					be a clich&#xE9; to say that the book is an eye-opener, but well, an
					eye-opener it is. A true believer in evidence-based medicine,
					Dr Goldacre demonstrates that the available evidence is
					often seriously flawed. Worse, the flaws have been introduced
					and perpetuated systematically by, or at the instance of, the
					pharmaceutical companies, in order to maintain their profits.
					In this, the companies have been aided and abetted by
					researchers, the regulators, the medical journal editors; in brief, all the gatekeepers have been compromised.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first and most important problem that Goldacre highlights
					is missing data. The data from a very large number of trials is
					never published. For many trials, the raw data is never made
					public and only the analysis is. This can be problematic, because
					the analysis can be fudged to show significant benefits where
					there are few or none, and/or to hide harms. Attempts to
					overcome the problem by, for example, introducing registries
					where all the trial data is entered, and a commitment by
					The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors that
					only registered trials would be published, have not worked,
					because of a failure by these institutions to adhere to their
					commitments. These are examples of what Goldacre excoriates
					as false fixes, i.e. institutional responses which pretend to solve the problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next problem that Goldacre highlights is the failure of the
					regulatory bodies like the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
					and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the USA. The main problem here is that these agencies, which are supposed
					to supervise the drug industry, have been captured by them
					(regulatory capture), and are far from effective in protecting
					the public.
				</p>
				<p>
					The third problem is bad trials. Goldacre gives numerous
					examples of how trials are manipulated in order to serve the
					purpose of the pharma industry. Sadly, many researchers
					actively collude, and many are passive spectators, fully aware
					that fraud is being perpetrated but doing nothing about it. For
					me, it was particularly distressing to read that even journals
					with high academic prestige, such as <i>The New England Journal
					of Medicine</i> and <em>The Lancet</em>, make huge amounts of money from the pharmaceutical industry and are therefore unwilling to do anything substantial to stem the rot. It seems that the sanctity of science is seriously compromised, and those
					charged with defending it have failed us all.
				</p>
				<p>
					A very large number of the articles which appear in even the
					most prestigious journals are ghost-written by the pharma
					industry and opinion leaders identified by the industry to
					put their names on the articles. In an informal nexus, the peer
					reviewers are also part of the consensus opinion, carefully
					nurtured over many paid conferences, and therefore fail to
					look at the data carefully and critically. Dr Goldacre shows
					how many of the guidelines to treatment relied upon by the
					majority of practitioners are not based on sound data, because
					the data is not available, but this is not acknowledged! The
					Cochrane Collaboration is an honourable exception.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Goldacre offers a number of solutions to the problems he
					highlights. These are mostly calls to the practitioners to not be
					enticed by the pharma industry. He is part of a major initiative
					to acquire better data by using the General Practitioners
					Database in the UK and this may provide truly useful data in
					the future. However, I think the key question is how to have a
					successful drug discovery and marketing programme without
					the profit motive. As long as profits are the prime force pushing
					the industry, there will exist strong incentives to make profits
					as quickly and as easily as possible, and all kinds of ethical
					problems will remain.
