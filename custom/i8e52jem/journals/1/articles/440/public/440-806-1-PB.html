			<h3>Negligence in sterilisation: the changing legal regime</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Runjhun Noopur, Dhruv Sharma</h4>
			<hr>

			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>Negligence in a sterilisation operation is a crucial issue in a country like India where sterilisation operations form an important part of government programs. This article seeks to  highlight the medico-legal dilemmas that surround this issue, and the legal  pronouncements on it. The article also deals with a recent policy initiative -  the Family Planning Insurance Scheme - that has been formulated in this regard,  its legal implications, and its impact on the medical fraternity as well as on  society as a whole.</p></div>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Negligence during a sterilisation operation has diverse
					implications for patients, ranging from serious health problems
					and threat to life to extreme economic hardships. The
					implications of such negligence are particularly grave because
					sterilisation operations such as tubectomies are elective, nontherapeutic
					interventions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Das A, Rai R, Singh D. Medical negligence and rights violation Econ Polit Wkly 2004 Aug 28; 39(35): 3876-9." id="1">(1)</a>. In India, sterilisation is a primary
					method of family planning and birth control and is an integral
					part of the National Family Planning Programme. Hence, the
					law relating to negligence in such operations becomes even
					more crucial. Negligence during sterilisation procedures can
					have two major consequences: serious health hazards including
					death of the patient, and unwanted pregnancy. In either case,
					the patient and his/her family ultimately have to undergo
					severe mental agony and suffering, the varied nature of which
					is reflected on a case to case basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Government of India has issued guidelines for sterilisation
					procedures in India. Sterilisation services are provided free of
					charge in government institutions. Guidelines have been issued
					from time to time by the government covering various aspects
					of sterilisation. These are: a) The age of the husband should not
					ordinarily be less than 25 years nor should it be over 50 years.
					b) The age of the wife should not be less than 20 years or more
					than 45 years. c) The motivated couple must have two living
					children at the time of operation. d) If the couple has three or
					more living children, the lower limit of age of husband or wife
					may be relaxed at the discretion of the operating surgeon. e) It is
					sufficient if the acceptor declares having obtained the consent
					of his / her spouse to undergo sterilisation operation without
					outside pressure, inducement or coercion, and that he /she
					knows that for all practical purposes, the operation is irreversible
					and also that the spouse has not been sterilised earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, studies in India by non-governmental organisations
					such as Healthwatch <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shri Ramakant Rai & Health Watch UP and Bihar v Union of India and Others (SC 2003), Supreme Court, Civil Writ Petition No. 209/2003." id="2">(2)</a> indicate high rates of death and
					failure of the procedure as a consequence of not following the
					government guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to understand the extent to which the standard
					practices recommended by the department of family welfare
					are being followed on the field, a study was conducted by
					Healthwatch UP-Bihar on reproductive and child health
					(RCH) camps in Uttar Pradesh between December 2002 and
					February 2003. The discrepancies included absence of proper
					counselling, no reading out of consent form, no adequate
					examination of patient's medical history, inadequate and
					insufficient medical equipment and non-conducive pre and
					post operative environment <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Das A, Rai R, Singh D. Medical negligence and rights violation Econ Polit Wkly 2004 Aug 28; 39(35): 3876-9." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A 1999 study of failures of laparoscopic procedures conducted
					by the State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency
					concluded that the failure rate was 4.7 per cent. Half the
					women covered in the study also suffered from post-operative
					complications <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healthwatch UP, Bihar( 2002) Priorities of the People, referred to in Das A, Rai R, Singh D. Medical negligence and rights violation Econ Polit Wkly 2004 Aug 28; 39(35): 3876-9. ; 39(35)" id="3">(3)</a>. The situation becomes worse in the absence
					of an adequately supportive legal regime.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ascertaining negligence</h4>
				<p>
					It is an established fact that no sterilisation operation can
					guarantee success and there are always instances when
					conception may occur despite the surgery and in the absence
					of any medical negligence <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State of MP v. Sundari Bai, AIR 2003 MP 284; State of Haryana v. Raj Rani 2005 (4) CPJ 28 (SC)." id="4">(4)</a>. Hence, the fact that a woman
					after having undergone a sterilisation operation becomes
					pregnant and delivers a child does not imply that her surgeon
					is liable; the claim can be sustained only if there is proof of
					negligence on the part of the surgeon <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State of Punjab v. Shivaram and others, AIR 2005 SC 3280." id="5">(5)</a>. The doctor will be
					held liable for negligence if the patient offered himself/herself
					for complete sterilisation and was assured after the operation
					that no child would be conceived <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State of Haryana v. Smt. Santra, AIR 2000 SC 1888." id="6">(6)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Failure of sterilisation: judicial response</h4>
				<p>
					There have been a number of judicial decisions from courts
					across the country attempting to define the legal standards
					of negligence in sterilisation operations and the loss suffered
					by patients. The Supreme Court of India has recognised the
					economic implications of having an unwanted child, which
					could have been avoided had the sterilisation operation been
					successful. The court has set a precedent by recognising the
					liability of the doctor as well as of the government, which
					advocates family planning as a way of relieving a couple of
					an economic burden they may not be able to shoulder <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State of Haryana v. Smt. Santra, AIR 2000 SC 1888." id="6">(6)</a>.
					The courts have also recognised and compensated the nonpecuniary
					injuries that might result from such negligence, such
					as mental trauma and distress. In one case the court ruled that
					the government was liable to pay compensation to a woman
					who had become pregnant after her husband underwent
					vasectomy and had to face humiliation, insult and torture as her integrity was doubted by her husband and his family who were
					led to believe that after the operation no child would be born
					<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shakuntala Sharma v. State of UP 2001 ACJ 620 (All-HC)." id="7">(7)</a>. The courts have also granted compensation in instances
					of death of the patient during a sterilisation operation <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajmal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1996 Raj 80." id="8">(8)</a> and
					when severe complications arose after the operation <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dr M K Gourikutty v. M.K Madhavan AIR 2001 Ker 398." id="9">(9)</a>.

				<h4>The family planning insurance scheme</h4>
				<p>
					While it is apparent that the judiciary has been taking a
					reasonably pro-active stand in matters related to negligent
					sterilisation operations, the government had been more or less
					inactive in this matter until recently. One of the most significant
					steps in constructing a more supportive regulatory regime for
					victims of negligence in case of sterilisation operations is the
					Family Planning Insurance Scheme which was launched in 2005
					<a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manual For Family Planning Insurance Scheme (To Be Operated By Oriental Insurance Company). 2005 Dec. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://mohfw.nic.in/dofw%20website/Family%20Planning%20Insurance%20Manual.pdf" id="10">(10)</a>. The scheme was launched in response to the exhaustive
					directives issued by the Supreme Court in its order dated
					March 1, 2005 in Civil Writ Petition No 209/2003 (Ramakant
					Rai v. Union of India) where it directed the Union of India and
					States/UTs to ensure enforcement of the union government's
					guidelines for conducting sterilisation procedures and norms
					for bringing about uniformity in sterilisation procedures <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manual For Family Planning Insurance Scheme (To Be Operated By Oriental Insurance Company). 2005 Dec. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from:http://mohfw.nic.in/dofw%20website/Family%20Planning%20Insurance%20Manual.pdf" id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before the launch of this scheme, no compensation was payable
					for failure of sterilisation, and no indemnity cover was provided
					to doctors or health facilities providing professional services for
					conducting sterilisation procedures etc. The scheme does away
					with the complicated process of ex-gratia payment to those
					who suffered from post-operative complications, incapacitation
					or death attributable to the procedure of sterilisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scheme grants a patient (or family as applicable)
					compensation of Rs 1 lakh in case of death due to sterilisation
					while in hospital, Rs 30,000 in case of death due to sterilisation
					within 30 days of discharge from hospital, a maximum
					of Rs 20,000 to cover expenses for treatment of medical
					complications due to the sterilisation operation (within 60 days
					of the operation) and Rs 20,000 in case of failure of sterilisation
					(including first instance of conception after sterilisation)
					<a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manual For Family Planning Insurance Scheme (To Be Operated By Oriental Insurance Company). 2005 Dec. [cited 2008 Dec 15]. Available from: http://mohfw.nic.in/dofw%20website/Family%20Planning%20Insurance%20Manual.pdf" id="10">(10)</a>. The scheme thus covers all sorts of damages that may
					be suffered by the victims of negligence during sterilisation
					operations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the scheme all doctors/health facilities including
					doctors/health facilities of central, state, local-self governments
					bodies, other public sectors, and all accredited doctors/health
					facilities of non-government and private sectors rendering
					family planning services and conducting such operations shall
					stand indemnified against the claims arising out of failure of
					the sterilisation procedure, death or medical complication
					resulting from it, up to a maximum amount of Rs 2 lakh per
					doctor/health facility per case. The cover also includes the legal
					costs and actual modality of defending the prosecuted doctor/
					health facility in court, which would be borne by the insurance
					company within certain limits.
				</p>
				<p>
					Liability of the insurance company under this section would be
					limited to four cases of negligence per doctor, beyond which
					the doctor/health facility concerned would be himself/herself
					responsible for his/her lapse, apart from any other action that
					may be taken by the government against the doctor/health
					facility.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was essential because doctors/health facilities were
					reluctant to conduct sterilisation operations fearing litigation
					if the procedure failed. The scheme provides an essential
					safeguard to ensure doctors participate in the sterilisation
					programme, which is essential for the success of the population
					policy in the country.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The adequacy of these measures is still under scrutiny and
					the quantum of compensation provided will inevitably
					be questioned. However, the insurance scheme is to be
					appreciated for removing the ambiguity and uncertainty of the
					law in this regard to quite an extent. The scheme provides for a
					uniform legal framework to deal with the issue of negligence
					in sterilisation procedures considering the ambiguity that has
					resulted from the wide range of judicial opinions in various
					courts across the country. The scheme presents a balanced
					approach and recognises the limitations of doctors and
					provides them with a reasonable safeguard. It is also crucial
					<br />
					because it recognises the problems of the victims of negligence
					and makes an attempt to create a reasonably favourable legal
					regime for them too.
