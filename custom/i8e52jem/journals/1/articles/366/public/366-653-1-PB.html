				<p>
					Public hospitals, especially those that are attached to medical colleges, perform invaluable services for their patients free of cost. They have three obligations: patient care, teaching and research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since all patients are treated free of cost, patients have an obligation towards the institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been the practice to use organs and tissues removed at surgery or at autopsy for teaching, research and mounting in museums. I see nothing wrong in using material obtained from patients for retrospective studies, especially since the confidentiality of patients is being respected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Were we to deny this to teaching hospitals, they will suffer a major handicap in two of their three functions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember that public hospitals attached to medical colleges have perennial problems obtaining funds, getting competent teachers and retaining them and generally carrying out their intended tasks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us not add to their problems on grounds that really make no practical difference to the vast majority of patients seeking care in these hospitals.
