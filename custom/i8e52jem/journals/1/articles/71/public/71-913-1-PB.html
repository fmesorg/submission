					On August 29, 2012, a court in Ahmedabad  ruled in a case involving 61 individuals accused of the massacre of 96  Muslims in Naroda Patiya, Gujarat, on February 28, 2002. The massacres  occurred a day after a terrible fire engulfed a train near Godhra,  Gujarat, in which 59 <em>karsevaks</em> (volunteer workers for a religious cause) were burnt alive, and more than 100 injured. The <em>karsevaks</em> were returning from Ayodhya where they were participating in a campaign  to build a temple dedicated to Ram on a site where a mosque had stood.  Subsequently, Naroda Patiya was one of many towns in Gujarat affected by  riots in which thousands of individuals, mainly Muslims, were murdered,  raped, looted, and displaced, their homes ransacked, their livelihoods  destroyed by activists of Hindu fundamentalist organisations. For over a  decade, victims of these pogroms have sought justice for their murdered  kin and for their own injuries, physical and psychological.
				</p>
				<p>
					On August 29, Dr Jyotsna Yagnik, designated judge for "Conducting  Speedy Trial of Riot Cases", found 32 of the 61 accused guilty of  multiple charges, including murder and criminal conspiracy. Of the 61  individuals, it is Accused no 37 (A-37), Dr Maya Surendrabhai Kodnani,  whose conduct is of interest to us as she was a gynaecologist who ran a  maternity home in the area. Societal roles played by physicians in the  past century have been discussed, comparing the very different  ideologies that have inspired them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Excerpts from Dr Jyotsna Yagnik's 1969-page judgement best convey the horrors that unfolded on February 28, 2002 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Special Court Designated for Conducting Speedy Trial of Riot Cases.

				</p>
				<p>The facts of this case</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<p>
						<em>(a) The assault and the attack made by the aggressor accused  was extremely brutal, gruesome, condemnable, inhuman, clearly violative  of human rights and Constitutional rights of victims of this case.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>(b) The 96 persons were killed mercilessly in a day and were  reduced to grilled meat, without any stimuli or provocation on their  part. Among the deceased victims, there were women, old persons,  helpless kids and even crippled person. </em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>About 125 victims have been found to have been victims of  crimes of hurt, grievous hurt, attempt to murder, etc. Among these  helpless 125 persons there was even an infant aged 20 days.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>(c) The killings of 96 persons was certainly targeted killing. It is proved to be a systematic campaign...</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>(d) The murders committed in this communal riot that too, of 96  Muslims in a day, cannot be termed to be usual set of murders, it is a  case of race multiple murders which has marked a black dot on the  secular salient feature of the Constitution of India.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>(e) Throughout the day the massacre went on, but the worst part  of the massacre was the gruesome and ghastly murders of 58 victims in  the evening occurrence at one place itself.</em>
					</p>
						
					<p>
						<em>(j) damages of lakhs of rupees, disturbance, damages to  household and business places, deaths, injuries violent disorder,  outraging modesty, rapes, gang rapes, mass torching including of women,  children, crippled, old, attack on dwelling houses, shops, cabins, carts  by burning and destroying, which reduced the properties to ashes......</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>(k) There are certain accused who have been proved to have  remained present and have participated in all the three occurrences viz.  morning, noon and evening occurrences. This reveals their commitment,  their priority in life, their tremendous bias and their throughout  involvement in the crime which went on for the entire day.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>These accused are such who have not spared a single minute of  that day for any other task of their lives and that right from 9:30 a.m.  to at least up to 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. they were very much on the site  unceasingly and continuously doing different offences for which, they  have been held guilty (1:1940)</em>
					</p>
				</ol>

				<p>The testimony of a prosecution witness (PW-236) describes Dr Kodnani's arrival on the scene:</p>
				<p>
					<em>PW-236:</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>(7.1) The witness has studied upto Std.VI, conversant with the  Gujarati language, at present occupation is rickshaw driving, in the  year 2002 had his own shop of mattresses, resident of Naroda Patiya, at  about 8.30 or 9.00 a.m. in the morning so many people gathered on the  road, the witness therefore went near Natraj Hotel, saw mob of 5 to 10  thousand persons, Mayaben (A-37) came there in Maruti Frontie with her  PA (Personal Assistant), they got down from Car, by seeing her, the  people who were standing there shouted the slogans of 'Jay Shri Ram',  (Victory to Lord Ram!).</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Mayaben (A-37) delivered a provoking speech, the gist of speech  spelling her instigation to the mob is, "I have seen dead bodies of Kar  Sevaks at Godhra. You Ram Bhakta devotees of Ram should kill Muslims  here, cut them, as the Babri Masjid had been demolished, the Masjid here  also should be destroyed, I am with you etc.", you will have no  difficulty. She then left...(1: 645).</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dressed in a white saree with a saffron scarf ( a colour that  symbolises courage) on her neck she then went in her white Maruti car  to:<em>"..... the S.T(State Transport) Workshop Gate. Mayaben  (A-37).....was followed by a Trax Jeep. Mayaben (A-37) gave signal to  the mob near Natraj and she called upon the mob (near) the Gate of S.T.  Workshop by indicating to them to come. About 100 leaders came  ....Mayaben (A-37) was discussing something with all of them and then  instructed her P.A., the P.A. took out the weapons from the Trax Jeep,  the weapons were sword, Bhala (spears),Trishul (tridents), revolvers  etc. Under the instructions, her P.A. gave all these weapons to the  leaders of the mob...(1:645).</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>... After Mayaben (A-37) went away, the men of the mob  including the P.A. had attacked (the) Nurani (Masjid). ...Mayaben (A-37)  said "Kill them. I am and will be with you always. You will always have  my backing." Mayaben was there for 30-45 minutes." (1:644) </em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"...on that day, A-37 came to the site twice in the  morning....She was seen near the Jawannagar Khada before 12 noon....At  about 2 pm she had telephoned to the fire brigade for fire call about  some petrol pump in the Naroda Patia area she has taken round at the  site of the offence..."</em> (1:1889)
				</p>

				<p>In the course of delivering her judgement, Judge Yagnik remarks:</p>
				<p>
					<em>(g) The seriousness of this offence is to be assessed from the  viewpoint that India is a Secular State and that such act and omission  and that too, by the elected member of the Constitutional Body</em> (Dr Maya Kodnani was the elected representative of that area to the State Assembly) <em>....design  to create a situation where, the conspiracy hatched is executed in its  full swing so as to see that the death toll of Muslims is risen and  other offences against minority are committed. Commission of this  offence is clearly a result of instigation and abetment by A-37 </em>(1:1948).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>...it stands proved beyond all reasonable doubt that the  accused was present and has participated in crime on that day, she was a  Kingpin of Naroda Patiya massacre and she is one of the principal  conspirators.....</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>It cannot be forgotten that the result of the conspiracy is doing away</em> (with) <em>about 96 Muslims and injury to about 125 Muslims</em> (1:1813).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>... As far as A-37 and other leaders of the communal riot are  concerned, ... who were admittedly the members of the Peace Committee of  the Sardarnagar Police Station and Naroda Police Station, it is to be  noted that they have not been found to have done any act of peace agent  or pacifying agent </em>(1:1849).
				</p>

				<p>
					A-37:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>(18.1) This accused was the then, current M.L.A.</em> (Member of the Legislative Assembly representing the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party, BJP, a right wing Hindu Nationalist party)<em> of the Naroda constituency </em>(1:1888).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The submission of A-37 that she is a victim of politics has  been pleaded for the first time without any background created in the  cross-examination of the PW and even through submission before this  Court. As a matter of fact, this Court has observed in its judgment that  A-37 was tremendously favoured by the then investigating agencies. All  care, at the cost of the duty of I.O. (Investigating Officer) and even  the interest of the victims of crime, was taken to see to it that, the  involvement of A-37 does not come on the books. This fact comes in the  way to believe that A-37 was ever a victim of any politics</em> (1:1945).
				</p>

				<p>
					Judge Yagnik then discusses the use of the death penalty as punishment and the plea of the accused for sympathetic consideration. She notes that at the end of 2009, about 139 countries had abolished the  death penalty, and that a "progressive society restricts the use of the  death penalty" (1:1939). Furthermore, "Article 5 of Universal  Declaration Of Human Rights .... guides to respect human dignity and it  also says that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment." Justice Yagnik states: "Use of  death penalty undermines human dignity. Moratorium on the use of the  death penalty contributes to the enhancement and progressive development  of human rights." (1:1940). Finally, given the facts of the case, "not  imposing death penalty can also be safely termed to be grant of the  prayer of sympathetic consideration, looking to their lion share in the  entire massacre at Naroda Patiya." (1:1949).

					The 57-year-old Dr Kodnani was sentenced to suffer 10 years of  rigourous imprisonment and then "to serve a minimum term of 18(eighteen)  years in jail without remissions before consideration of her case for  premature release". "For the past three years, when the trial was going  on in the special court, Maya had to be present in the court every  working day from 10am to 5pm. She portrayed an overtly religious  picture, praying and reading the scripture in the courtroom" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rawat B.

					Maya Kodnani was born to parents who were refugees from the  Tharparkar district of Sindh following the partition of British India  into India and Pakistan in 1947. Her father, a teacher, settled in Deesa  in Northern Gujarat where he started a Gujarati medium school of which  his daughter was a student <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Express News Service.

Mayaben was actively associated with the  Rashtra Sevika Samiti (National Women's Volunteer Committee), the  women's wing of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh(RSS, a right wing  paramilitary Hindu organisation) since her college days in Baroda. She  graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) and  then trained for a Diploma in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (DGO). She  founded the Shivam Maternity Home in Naroda which she sold only a few  months ago, apparently "sensing she could be convicted in the riot case  against her and it would be impossible to run the establishment from  jail" <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yahoo!

					Described as a good orator, Kodnani was a 'rising star' in the BJP  and rose rapidly within its ranks. Elected to the Ahmedabad Municipal  Corporation in 1995, she was made chairperson of the AMC's Health  Committee because of her medical background. First elected to the  Gujarat Legislative Assembly in 1998, winning by 75,000 votes, a margin  she bettered in December 2002 ( 10 months after the riots ) when she  won by 110,000 votes. In 2007, she won by 180,000 votes, the most  substantial victory in the state <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Express News Service.

She sailed along, garlanded, feted  and adored by a huge majority of her constituents. In 2007, she was  appointed Minister of State (Junior Minister) for Women and Child  Development (a more Orwellian title is difficult to conceive of), a  position from which she resigned only after her arrest in February 2009.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until then, Dr Kodnani denied having been present at Naroda  Patiya. Dr Syeda Hameed was part of an all-India team of six women to  visit Dr Kodnani at her home, a few days after the massacre. "The lady  denied everything; she was not in Naroda Patiya that morning. She was at  the hospital receiving burnt bodies of the Karsevaks from Sabarmati  Express. Discounting all newspaper reports and photographs, she said  "All lies, all doctored." <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hameed S.

				<p>
					Dr Kodnani was not the only Gujarati medical professional  prominent in the RSS and larger "Sangh Parivar" (the wider grouping of  fundamentalist Hindu political, paramilitary and other front  organisations).
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Jaydeep Patel, a pathologist, was general secretary of the  Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a militant Hindu organisation which spread  rumours about Muslims after the Godhra carnage on 27th February 2002.  The VHP also spearheaded attacks against the Muslim community. Dr Patel,  although expected to be charged in the Naroda Patiya massacres, awaits  the verdict of another trial known as the Naroda Gam case where 11  people were killed. Dr Patel is alleged to have been in close contact  via telephone with the main accused in the Naroda Patiya massacres  including Dr Kodnani <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="PTI.SIT interrogates ex VHP leader Jaydeep Patel in 2002 riot case.

His frequent vitriolic anti-Muslim speeches continue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The utter disregard for human life, the aiding and abetting of  murder and other horrific acts, the distribution of arms to an incensed  mob; these are not acts one associates with an obstetrician whose  training and practice involve one of the most joyous events in human  life the birth of a child. One cannot even imagine what Dr Kodnani  did on February 28, 2002, all day long urging the mob to kill Muslims,  to destroy their place of worship. Judge Yagnik has described her as  the kingpin of the massacre at Naroda Patiya. While the trial has  resulted in a measure of justice, the road to August 29, 2012 was far  from easy. As the case report makes clear, at every step the state, its  elected officials and administrative machinery failed in their primary  duty to protect the lives of citizens. Instead mob violence was  tolerated, even instigated and encouraged. As soon as the riots ended,  the victims and relatives of the deceased sought the assistance of the  investigative and judicial arms of the state. None was forthcoming.  Indeed the actions of the senior police inspector at Naroda Patiya, KK  Mysorewala,were the opposite of what they should have been. Judge Yagnik  repeatedly points to his dereliction of duty. However, it is not the  shortcomings and bias of the Gujarat Police and judicial system that  this article seeks to discuss.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rather it is the astonishing societal climate in which Dr Mayaben  Kodnani flourished professionally and politically. Her conduct, immoral,  unethical and vile, is particularly appalling for a woman physician. In  the Gujarat of the past two decades her actions had a social legitimacy  that remains deeply troubling. For neither she nor Drs Patel and  Togadia would have so publicly paraded their odious disregard for Muslim  lives had they thought it likely that they would be subject to censure  among their peers or ostracising by kith and kin. One of the most  agonising aspects of the pogroms of 2002 is the lack of remorse,  especially in Gujarat's large 'hard Hindutva' (militant, even  belligerent Hindu nationalist) middle class, a class from which its  professional elites emerge.
				</p>
				<p>
					The absence of social sanction, the encouragement of bigotry, the  deliberate repetition of lies that feed and further hatred, makes it  unsurprising that none of the medical associations in Gujarat, or in  India for that matter, raised their voices against these individuals. No  professional group set up inquiries that might have revealed gross  violations of medical ethics resulting in their expulsion from the group  and de-recognition of their licenses. Article 6.6 in the Code of Ethics  of the Medical Council of India deals with human rights and states:  "The physician shall not aid or abet torture nor shall he be party to  either infliction of mental or physical trauma or concealment of torture  inflicted by some other persons or agency in clear violation of human  rights." <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India.

Indian J Med Ethics.2002;10(3);13." id="6">(6)</a> raised  the issue; but those institutions that have the duty to enforce basic  ethical norms failed to act, at local, state and national levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					The societal role of the medical profession in modern times has  been a chequered one. Individual physicians have pursued vastly  different ideals and ideologies. Prominent examples, literally from A to  Z, include Presidents Salvador Allende (overthrown and killed in a  US-backed coup) and Michelle Bachelet of Chile (tortured by the Pinochet  dictatorship), Ernesto "Che" Guevera(assassinated by the CIA assisted  by Bolivian forces), Binayak Sen (arrested under false charges for his  struggle for fair treatment for Adivasis and other disenfranchised  people), to Ayman al Zawahiri (current leader of Al-Qaeda).
				</p>
				<p>
					Physicians generally belong to the status quoist section of  society. Right wing ideology, when on the ascendant in difficult  economic times, has found in the medical profession a solid ally. In  Gujarat, curiously, this ideology was and remains ascendant in the <em>absence</em> of an economic crisis. The zeal shown by Drs Kodnani, Patel and Togadia  in pursuing bigotry is, unfortunately, not a historical aberration.
				</p>
				<p>

What is less publicised is  the courage of physicians like Drs Dorota Lorska, Alina Brewda and  Adelaide Hautval. All three were prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Dr  Hautval, the daughter of a Protestant pastor, arrested in April 1942 for  trying to enter German-occupied Paris, was deported to Auschwitz  because she protested the harsh treatment of her fellow Jewish prisoners  by the Gestapo. At Auschwitz, she refused to participate in forced  sterilisation. Dr Lorska recalls Dr Hautval saying that as they would  not get out of the camp alive, "the only thing left for us to do is for  us to behave, for the rest of the short time left to us, as human  beings" <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paldiel M.

It is important to note that none of the three women  doctors received additional punishment as a consequence. of their  principled stand.

				<p>
					After the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, many  disturbing reports detail the presence of physicians at torture  sessions, or their certifying that a tortured prisoner was now well  enough for "enhanced interrogation techniques", or blatantly lying when  stating a cause of death as "natural" or "suicide" instead of murder <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Miles SH.

					A formal adherence to oaths or codes of ethics is required of  physicians, but neither the Hippocratic Oath with its popularly  understood dictum of <em>Primum non nocere</em> (First do no harm) nor the  World Medical Association's Declaration of 2006 <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association. Declaration of Geneva [Internet]. Revised 173rd WMA Council Session, Divonne-les-Bains, France,2006 May [cited 2012 Dec 31]. Available from: http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/g1/ WMA Declaration of Geneva.2006." id="18">(18)</a> has resulted in  universal respect for their directives. Few voices are raised decrying  gross breach of professional standards; outrage is, by and large, muted.
				</p>
				<p>
					What makes Dr Kodnani's conduct unique is her publicly aiding and  abetting mass murder. Physicians participating in this manner are rare,  public display exhorting such acts even rarer. I am not aware of a  single such action on the part of a physician of <em>publicly</em> exhorting people to kill the members of a community, distributing arms  etc. Yet, even she appears to have realised that her presence on the  scene was problematic, at least legally. Hence her passionate denials  about being there <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hameed S. Grieving families will now sleep in peace.

				</p>

					Other trials related to the pogroms of 2002 continue in Gujarat,  begun only after the extraordinary effort of dedicated individuals who  were themselves subjected to calumny. The wheels of justice sputter  along due to the intervention of the Supreme Court of India after the  initial laughably lax investigative efforts of the state of Gujarat with  its accepted anti-Muslim stance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gujarat was not always so callous and cruel in its mores.  Universally associated with the name of Mohandas K Gandhi, its most  distinguished son, Gujarat's first Chief Minister was a highly  accomplished and respected physician: Dr Jivraj N Mehta. Involved in  and incarcerated during the struggle for India's freedom, a leading  member of the Indian National Congress <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goenka AH, Kulkarni HS. A tribute to the indomitable spirit of Jivraj Mehta. J Postgrad Med.2006Jul-Sep;52(3):226-9." id="19">(19)</a>, he is considered by  political observers to have been the best Chief Minister in Gujarat's  52-year existence. Jivraj Mehta was not the only renowned medical  professional to participate in politics; Dr B C Roy, Chief Minister of  West Bengal was another stalwart.

					Earlier in 1937, with India still under British rule, on the  request of the Chinese Red Army General, Zhu De, a team of five doctors the Indian Medical Mission went to China to treat the sick and  wounded after the Japanese invasion of that country. One of the five, Dr  Dwarkanath Kotnis died at the age of 32, during that mission. Madame  Sun Yat-sen's tribute to Dr Kotnis jolts, especially as one reads it in  the context of Dr Kodnani's behaviour: "His memory belongs not only to  your people and ours but to the noble roll-call of fighters for the  freedom and progress of all mankind. The future will honour him even  more than the present, because it was for the future that he  struggled...&quot; <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centurychina.com. Indian CCP member still honored today long after death by Jap imperialists [Internet]. 2008 Oct 6[cited 2012 Dec 31].

				</p>
				<p>
					Political activity by physicians then has ranged from unbelievably  courageous acts to  unimaginably despicable ones, raising questions  that confound and perplex. The medical profession, the last of the  medieval guilds, confers considerable autonomy on its members. The guild  protects while laying down conditions, including ethical codes, under  which it will do so <a class="reference" href="#twenty one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reed RR, Evans D. The professionalization of medicine: Causes, effects and responses. JAMA. 1987 Dec 11;258(22):3279-82" id="21">(21)</a>. In Gujarat, the guild failed miserably in  requiring its members to abide by these conditions. But, as Madame Sun  Yat-Sen said in 1942, "it was for the future that he (Dr Kotnis)  struggled" <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centurychina.com. Indian CCP member still honored today long after death by Jap imperialists [Internet]. 2008 Oct 6[cited 2012 Dec 31]. Available from: http://www.centurychina.com/plaboard/archive/3803603.shtml" id="20">(20)</a>. Our struggle in Gujarat and, indeed everywhere, <em>is</em> for the future. The legacy of Accused no 37 must be a questioning of  the prevailing ethos that has reigned so widely, smugly and arrogantly  among the Gujarati middle class. Substantial sections of Gujarati  society need to re-examine their recent histories. The graphic  description of the incineration and murder of 96 persons should lead to a  realisation: it could easily have been me or someone I care for; and  then too, it should not happen to anyone, anywhere....
				</p>
				<p>
					The pogroms of 2002 remain a matter of deep personal anguish and  shame, especially for those of us medical professionals with present or  ancestral ties to Gujarat. Can we reconstruct a Gujarat that  wholeheartedly embraces its wondrously diverse heritage: Hindu, Jain,  Muslim, Parsi? A Gujarat where medical professionals follow in the  tradition of individuals like Dr Jivraj Mehta and where the stain of  those who aided and abetted the murder of innocents is a distant memory?  As was repeatedly proclaimed by those who suffered in Latin America  during the dark days of many a torture-happy dictatorship <em>"Nunca mas"</em> Never again!
