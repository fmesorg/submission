			<h2>CORRUPTION IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE</h2>

			<!-- Article Name -->
			<h3>Bioethics and corruption: a personal struggle</h3>

			<h4 class="author">Bela Blasszauer</h4>

			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The author attempts to give a general picture of corruption,
					especially in the area of healthcare. Corruption ranges from fraud, through deceit, bribery and dehumanisation, to immeasurable moral decay.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a bioethicist who has challenged corruption in various ways, the author approaches this worldwide plague mainly on the basis of his personal experience. He does not offer a recipe for successfully combating corruption, but tries to provide some ways and means to fight immorality without self-defeat. Bioethics is not a discipline whose task is to investigate, expose, or punish corrupt people. A number of agencies exist for this "noble" job. Nevertheless, an ethics teacher should not be completely indifferent to obvious and harmful immoral behaviour, regardless of his/her personal compulsions. It is not the "patient rights" that threaten the prestige of the medical profession; it is rather the bad apples that infiltrate the moral mission of this esteemed work.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems that the hardest challenges in the struggle against corruption are bad laws-laws that provide loopholes and
					immunity to immoral dealings. In a stable, strong democracy,
					morally unfounded laws can, and will be changed. Where real
					democracy exists, they would not even have come into effect.

				<h4>Facing corruption: a personal account</h4>
				<p>
					"Where are all the bioethicists when you need them?" asks the
					title of an interesting article by Subrata Chattopadhyay and
					his colleagues <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chattopadhyay S, Gillon JJ Jr, De Vries R. Where are all the bioethicists when you need them? J R Soc Med. 2012 Apr;105(4):143-6. doi 10 1258/jrsm.2012.110284" id="1">(1)</a> . They refer to the fight against corruption in
					healthcare. Well, here I am, one of the few. I finished the study
					of law and then worked at a medical university where quite
					accidentally, I became a teacher of Marxist ethics, then medical
					ethics, and finally bioethics. At that time, in the 1980s, no one in Hungary knew what bioethics was. I consider bioethics simply as a discipline of ethics in healthcare and medicine. Robert
					Baker, a prominent bioethicist from New York, answers the
					question: "What is bioethics? in this way:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I take bioethics to be a multidisciplinary field whose
						members include administrators, clinicians and health
						professionals of all sorts, historians, lawyers, literary
						scholars, nurses, philosophers, physicians, policy analysts
						and policy makers, psychologists, religion scholars,
						scientists, social scientists, theologians and others united by
						the common purpose of analyzing, consulting, researching,
						studying and attempting to address, mediate and offer
						ethical solutions or resolutions to actual or potential
						ethical problems arising in biomedicine, biomedical
						science and healthcare <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baker R. What is a Bioethicist? Medical College of Wisconsin blog. Milwaukee, WI:Medical College of Wisconsin; 2005 Nov 17[cited 2013 May 20]. Available from: mcw-bioethics@mailman.mcw.edu" id="2">(2)</a>.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Way back in the pioneering times in Hungary, in the early
					1980s, medical ethics was the exclusive domain of medical
					doctors. Their main topics were: Hippocrates, the doctor as the
					ship's captain, and the so-called "tips" (parasolvencia, bribes,
					under-the-counter payments, etc.) given to doctors secretly for
					various favours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to the birth of bioethics and its subsequent advances, I too
					felt the need to deal with issues connected with patient rights;
					and instead of a one-sided approach, I initiated professional
					and public debates on genuine ethical questions such as, death
					and dying, euthanasia, human experimentation, confidentiality,
					and the like. At the same time, I strongly felt the need to
					challenge immoral behaviour within the healthcare system.
					This "atypical heroism" might have come from my own feelings
					of intolerance towards the prevailing widespread corruption
					and immorality, and my deep sympathy for the "underdog". A
					famous Hungarian writer and poet said something like this:
					"Guilty (is he) who is silent among corrupt and unjust people"
					(Mihaly Babits, 1883-1941). I just did not want to be a silent bystander, especially when my job was to improve the moral/
					ethical standards of future doctors and nurses.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is obvious to me that corruption and immorality can hardly be
					separated. The Oxford English Dictionary defines corruption as
					<em>"(a) moral deterioration, especially widespread; (b) use of corrupt practices, especially bribery or fraud; (c) an irregular alteration of a phenomenon from its original state; (c) decomposition, e.g. a corpse."</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Is it possible that corruption is inbuilt in human nature? Is there any sign in the earliest life of a human being of greed or the hunger for power? Does a newborn already have the potential
					to become corrupt one day? Yes, I believe it has. It probably
					depends on how the possible contributing factors, such as
					socialisation, the cultural environment, education, family life,
					the stability of the community and the country influence and/
					or determine the individual's life.
				</p>
				<p>
					If someone can kick the kindergarten teacher at the age of five without retribution, just because he/she comes from a rich
					or influential family, if the same person can get high grades
					in elementary school and high school for the same reason;
					if he/she is admitted to university and receives a diploma in
					exchange for expensive "gifts" or valuable favours to certain
					teachers instead of hard work; then the seeds of corruption are
					well-rooted in this human soul.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transparency International is the "watchdog" but it is hard
					to imagine that this kind of dishonesty would be included
					in its corruption scale. Bioethicists cannot and should not
					take over the job of the law enforcement agencies, the state
					administration, or the other dozens of agencies whose duty it
					is to guarantee the lawful functioning of the healthcare system.
					Unfortunately, what is lawful is not necessarily moral.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bioethicists ought to fight for good laws which do not
					discriminate, and do not force the healthcare profession to
					resort to corruption in order to solve the problems of their daily existence. However, the bioethicist's opinion is hardly sought by the lawmakers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the years I have really had to struggle, face serious
					conflicts, guard my job and face vicious attacks from several
					directions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The enemy of the medical profession</h4>
				<p>
					In some circles I was considered an enemy of the medical
					profession. While I kept writing and speaking about timely
					issues of bioethics, I developed a close awareness of the
					everyday realities of healthcare, since I was teaching English
					to many physicians. Besides the issues of euthanasia, abortion,
					informed consent and many others, my attention extended
					to corruption in my own country and worldwide. Under- thecounter
					payments to doctors were not the only negative
					phenomena that had to be faced.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, the practice of tipping, giving money in envelopes (in this part of the world not a red but a white one) to doctors and nurses for various favours is generally an act of corruption. It is
					especially so, if money or free services are openly demanded, or
					forced out through manipulation. Besides tipping, I have had to
					deal with such subjects as malpractice, manipulation of waiting
					lists, therapeutic nihilism, scientific fraud, sexual abuse, brutal
					and shocking information to patients, irrational and unjust
					allocation of resources, kickbacks, and unprincipled solidarity
					with doctors committing immoral acts, and so on. More than
					just a few persons, patients and relatives, and even students
					came to me for help, believing that through my writings or
					public appearances I could do something to solve, or at least
					alleviate their problems concerning healthcare. Sometimes I
					could help; most of the time I could not.
				</p>
				<p>
					I noticed that the WHO definition of health, i.e. <em>"a state of
					complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely
					the absence of disease or infirmity"</em><a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Grad FP. The Preamble of the Constitution of the World Health Organization. Bull World Health Organ. 2002;80(12):981-4. Epub 2003 Jan 23." id="3">(3)</a> was a wonderful goal for health for all. However, a legitimate question may arise, namely &ndash; how many people in a state of social well-being can
					we find in countries where corruption is widespread and the
					level of poverty staggering?
				</p>
				<p>
					We organised an international meeting in my home town
					under the name of the East-West Bioethics Conference. Here, I
					must mention that without moral and financial support coming
					from the West (e.g. Nuffield and Soros Foundation, the Hastings
					Center) in the form of invitations, scholarships and libraries,
					the former communist Central and East-European countries
					would still be in the stone age as far as bioethics is concerned.
					My work and "unusual" interest put me in the leadership of the
					International Network on Petty Corruption in Health Care, as
					one of the projects of the International Association of Bioethics. The Network became a forum for a worldwide discussion on corruption. Of course, even this prestigious organisation had
					neither the authority nor the means to investigate any practice
					of corruption that speakers around the world brought out into
					the open. They could, however, release the pent-up steam that
					had accumulated in them over a period of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					No one could follow the aftermath, though it seems hardly
					possible that those openly voiced immoral practices continued
					to be ignored in all the respective countries. The participants
					in the Network came closer to each other, shared their
					experiences in some detail, and also tried to find ways to
					combat corruption. The sponsors did not seem to mind that
					corruption was on the agenda in every international congress.
					The media was eager to cover some of the stories heard during
					the session.
				</p>
				<p>
					At home, my involvement in exposing corruption was not
					welcomed, to put it mildly. Although a university lecturer
					usually works until the age of 70, and a "cooperative" person,
					can work as an emeritus professor practically until death; I was
					kicked out of the university at the age of 65.
				</p>
				<p>
					What could I have done to keep my job? The recipe-
					perhaps in many places in the world-is manifold. First of all,
					stay away from criticising medical professionals, and avoid
					conflict, especially with the establishment. It is also good to remain silent, or talk about irrelevant things. Once during an
					institutional meeting, the boss who kicked me out read the
					newest fire regulation page by page, so that no time remained
					to discuss pressing problems concerning the future plans of
					the Institute. That reminds me of Professor Donald Evans from
					New Zealand, who often remarked sarcastically how safe it is for
					an ethicist to speak and write about nonsense such as whether
					angels have beards or not. So, with a little exaggeration, I would say that a bioethicist who challenges corruption is embarking on a suicidal venture.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, the teaching of bioethics could do
					something to ease the tension generated by corruption. As
					I have already mentioned, teachers are needed who are at
					least totally moral and committed to their patients, justice and
					honesty. Those who are teachers should themselves set good
					examples. Even if a teacher is not a Mother Teresa or a Nelson
					Mandela, he/she should be a person who wants to imprint
					in the minds of future professionals the ancient truth that
					medicine is a moral enterprise.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel that my own human dignity is much more important
					to me than to follow any formula for success. Unfortunately,
					corruption exists in all areas of life. Some forms are well hidden, others are irritatingly open. I could easily put together a long list of various types of corruption but I just mention two that have recently deeply affected the moral sense of millions of Hungarians.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The smoker and the paedophile</h4>
				<p>
					The government has launched an all-out campaign against
					smokers. They must not smoke in restaurants, in the entire area
					of hospitals, near to playgrounds, bus stops, coffee stands, and
					so on. The fines are high, but the results are not so spectacular.
					At the same time, Parliamentary representatives have nine
					designated places in the building where they can ease their
					nicotine hunger. Strangely, anti-smoking tablets are sold like hot
					cakes, and those who have no jobs, inadequate income and no
					hope feel that the last resort to enjoying something in this life
					is becoming more and more only a dream. No doubt smoking
					is a health hazard, but prevention ought to be emphasised and
					invested in, instead of declaring smokers as public enemies.
					In contrast, while smokers are hunted down, paedophiles can
					feel safe because no one really goes after them, especially
					if powerful persons are behind them. Should I just close my
					eyes to this and do nothing? Or should I expect bus drivers or
					locksmiths to fight for the rights of people, whether they are
					smokers or patients? Of course, not all bioethicists can, or even
					should be, frontline fighters against corruption and injustice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other example has only as much to do with bioethics as
					smoking, but serves as a good example of the serious moral
					harm that a person in high position can cause to a whole
					society. Recently, the president of the Hungarian state was
					accused of plagiarism concerning his doctoral dissertation.
					The accusation was well founded, and the president had to
					resign. His party tried to defend him till the last, and called
					those journalists who exposed him "pen-pushing terrorists". It is very sad because the moral decay of the highest institutions
					shakes the citizens' feelings of right and wrong and thus the
					moral texture of society weakens.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the communist era, there was much less corruption and it
					was much less harmful. The reason was probably the policy
					of full employment. Everybody had to have a job. Now, in our
					developing capitalist system there are a growing number of
					jobless people, and unlimited ways to steal, cheat, embezzle
					and get rich by being corrupt. Of course, poverty is not the
					reason for corruption, but it may be a warm bed for it. I say
					openly that socialism saw less corruption than our present
					capitalist system. For one thing, socialism operated in a police
					state. There was a watchdog at every corner. Corruption could
					occur mainly in the top party hierarchy. The majority of the
					people lived-although in a very modest way-in financial
					security. Those who wanted to loaf around, ended up in jail.
					Now millions of Hungarians live below the poverty line. The
					visible contrast between the rich and the poor is irritating.
					Some people believe, quite justly, that not every rich person
					has piled up his wealth in a legitimate way. Thus, some may
					think that the best way to combat immorality is to be immoral
					as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					As I have mentioned elsewhere: <em>corruption destroys human
					relationships, creates an atmosphere of the law of the jungle,
					promotes subservience, pessimism and anxiety, leads to moral
					chaos and makes the functioning of the society almost impossible.
					Where corruption becomes a way of life, flexibility and adaptation to that kind of social environment come to be much more valuable than hard work, talent, diligence or achievement. Undoubtedly corruption in healthcare has serious implications for the fate of patients</em> [Emphasis added] <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Blasszauer B. Petty corruption in health care. J Med Ethics. 1997 Jun;23(3):133-4." id="4">(4)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					One other problem with criticising corruption is that as soon as it is done, the defenders of corruption, and/or the protectors of professional prestige, accuse the critics of generalisation. Every writer and speaker knows that generalisation is absolutely
					unjust and unfounded. Thus, it is obvious that there are, indeed,
					dedicated doctors, nurses, and researchers who keep the
					system running.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The selection or contra-selection of bioethics
				teachers</h4>
				<p>
					As I mentioned, I became an ethics teacher quite by accident.
					The leader of my institute who happened to be the ethics
					teacher died, and somebody had to take over. I was that
					somebody with a law diploma and two years of education in
					philosophy. Since then, practically anybody can become a
					bioethics teacher. In fact, ethics, or bioethics can be integrated
					into the curriculum, and it can just as easily be eliminated from
					it. In most of our universities and colleges, anyone who has
					good personal connections with the leadership, and stays as
					far from controversial issues as possible, is a suitable bioethicist. You may last longer as a bioethics teacher if you emphasise the superior moral virtues of the medical profession during lectures and/or seminars, and give good grades at the exams. No one controls the quality and the effectiveness of bioethics teaching. There is no unified teaching programme. There are neither defined goals nor reliable ideas about the changes of moral status of medicine and healthcare. The feedback of the
					students is important but hardly a decisive value judgment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The opinion of Kamran Abbasi that "Corruption is an important
					but overlooked medical issue" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" "data-trigger"="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abbasi K. Guiding the moral vision of medicine. J R Soc Med. 2012 Apr;105(4):139. doi: 10.1258/jrsm.2012.12k028." id="5">(5)</a>  is somewhat questionable. In
					my opinion, it is not overlooked but a very risky business, for
					many reasons. One of them is obvious-it is hard to prove. It
					is even harder to find whistleblowers who would provide
					proof of corrupt practices. Very few people would risk their
					very existence. For example, it is not a coincidence that one of
					the main ethical problems in many countries is the failure to
					report incompetent or impaired colleagues. Those who embark
					on opposing corruption cannot even rely on social research
					carried out by various surveys. I know of some of these, and I
					feel that many of them are absolutely unreliable. They are
					quite distorted because very few people would admit openly
					that, for example, they have bribed doctors. There is no proof
					whether they did or did not. These surveys usually show that
					the money received by doctors illegally is rather negligible and
					it is thus not worth dealing with. I believe, however, that even
					one's spouse does not know how much one receives through
					forbidden channels. Instead of studying apologetic surveys,
					one should look into the healthcare system of such countries
					as Costa Rica. From various sources, I have heard that there
					is hardly any significant degree of corruption in this Latin
					American country.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to face corruption in healthcare you should be in
					close touch with reality. You cannot be sitting in an ivory
					tower, and rely on hearsay. Only a very few bioethicists have
					the opportunity to follow closely what is going on inside an
					institution. Somehow you must have firsthand experience or
					reliable eyewitnesses; otherwise you are entering a minefield.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dealing with corruption is further complicated by the fact
					that some form of corruption is legalised. For instance, our
					widespread tipping system, although illegal, is taxed! There
					are, indeed, some doctors and others who do report a meagre
					income at the end of the year. The newest twist in the law that
					has just recently come into effect is that a doctor can accept
					tips only if his or her boss previously permits it! I need not
					remind anybody that the biggest money makers, or padded
					envelope collectors, are exactly those who might permit the
					subordinates to augment their income through the "gratitude"
					of their patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another example is that in our state-run healthcare system,
					hospitals may increase their income by creating elite wards
					for those who wish to receive superior service, and are able to
					pay for it. It can only be done by violating equality. Yet another
					example might be the composition and working of the research
					ethics committees. They are established everywhere just as the
					laws demand, so that lay people can feel assured knowing that
					there is an organisation that is supposed to guard their interest, and thus they cannot be victims of foul human experiments. The major problem is, however, that many of these research ethics committees are made up of exactly those persons who have some personal interest in drug companies. If they have no truck with drug companies, then they are usually selected on
					the basis of their ability to nod their heads.
				</p>
				<p>
					There may be another reason for "overlooking" corruption,
					namely, the division of labour among bioethicists. There are
					those who deal with theoretical questions, as for example, what
					autonomy means, or when life begins; and there are those who
					study and write about something that is fashionable, attractive
					and/or believed to have important practical value. Fortunately,
					no one can be forced to cope with corruption.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>What can bioethics do?</h4>
				<p>
					In general, bioethics has already done a lot. Just to mention
					one instance, it has achieved a worldwide implementation of
					patient's rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I agree with Kamran Abbasi that the interpretation of
					ethical issues is culturally bound, I cannot accept the claim that
					"One doctor's corruption is another doctor's cultural norm". I
					would rather agree with Subrata Chattopadhyay when he says
					that culture should not be used as justification for corruption
					(private communication). I should add that enlightened, wellinformed individuals may not stick to their cultural tradition if their own autonomous decision brings them a better life. If we look around the world, we see, for example, that such ethical principles as informed consent broke through many cultural barriers and became a way of life in the physician-patient relationship.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, bioethicists can combat corruption-if they have
					both courage and interest-by working to enact better laws, to
					widen public control and to rely more on the media. The media
					can give invaluable help in providing objective, many-sided
					information and in exposing immoral and unfair practices. The
					media does not shy away from controversies; thus it can be a
					very good ally for bioethicists. It is hard to achieve any result
					if locally, at one's university or college, there are no prominent persons who recognise and support the noble efforts and goals of the bioethicist.
				</p>
				<p>
					I, for instance, had tremendous support from our rector
					who, as a new broom, wanted to improve the moral level
					of our university. That was his main campaign slogan. He
					appointed me to lead the university's ethics committee. The
					committee included nurses, doctors, sociologists, journalists
					and a priest. For about a year the committee functioned well.
					We were afraid of no one, and tried to be fair and consistent.
					Two cases might be worth mentioning that may have led to
					our disappearance. No one ordered the seizure of our work
					or threatened our existence, we just disappeared. Neither
					case was ethically extraordinary. One was about the much
					neglected university park that was full of dirt and litter. We
					found out that theoretically there were eight park workers
					on the payroll. Strangely, they all worked in offices. The other
					case concerned the leader of an infant unit. He applied for a
					top German scholarship. He was notified that his application
					had been accepted and that he had been granted the scholarship. However, someone from his clinic sent a forged
					letter under his name to the German university declining the
					scholarship. So this man lost the chance to study in a famous
					German university. Our committee looked into the problem
					and it became obvious that a powerful clique had blocked this
					doctor's chance to spend some time abroad. Our stand in the
					matter shook the university, and we became a much unwanted
					group of people who went over the limit, and threatened
					the establishment and indeed the power structure itself. Our
					elimination was well engineered. A parallel ethics committee
					was set up with absolutely "reliable" people. Suddenly all the
					ethics cases started going to this committee, and we were
					totally ignored, just as if we did not exist. And we didn't.
				</p>
				<p>
					To fight corruption, collective efforts and actions are very
					important. The question, however, is how and where to recruit
					a strong collective force. Common goals can only be achieved if
					such individual bioethicists are found anywhere in the world, as
					are willing to combat immorality in healthcare. The Corruption
					Network of the International Association of Bioethics has not
					done anything spectacular, but it has reminded a lot of people
					that corruption exists, and that it is very harmful.

				<h4>Epilogue</h4>
				<p>
					Before you feel sorry for the author of this paper, I must add
					that after my forced retirement I was given a scientific advisory
					status in the same medical university's Institute of Family
					Medicine. <em>And I am still there</em>. In the meantime, I received the
					Gold Cross of Merit of the Hungarian Republic. I still don't know
					how it could happen; nevertheless, it seems that there are not
					just enemies but also sympathisers around the person who
					dares to confront corruption. Perhaps, they are the so-called
					silent majority.
