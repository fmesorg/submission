				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Background: The GeneXpert&reg; MTB/RIF (hereinafter Xpert) test  														has demonstrated sensitive detection of tuberculosis (TB) and  														Rifampicin resistance directly from untreated sputum in less than  														two hours. India is currently drafting the third phase of its Revised  														National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP). This process  														provides the country's health authorities with an ideal opportunity  														to revolutionise TB management in the country. The RNTCP is  														currently conducting a multi&ndash;site demonstration study to gather  														operational evidence to scale up the Xperttest under Indian  														programme conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discussion: With the impending publication of RNTCP's third phase,  														we consider the obligations of India's RNTCP in the light of the  														World Health Organization's Guidance on ethics of tuberculosis  														prevention, care and control, published in November 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					Summary: India is ethically obliged to phase&ndash;in the nationwide  														deployment of Xpert, a generic equivalent, or a quality lower&ndash;cost  														molecular diagnostic alternative, preferably made in India, as soon  														as reasonably possible. Further, India is ethically obliged to provide  														those diagnosed with first&ndash;line drug resistance universal access  														to second&ndash;line TB drugs. Doing so will reduce India's morbidity  														and mortality associated with diagnostic delay, dropout, and  														mistreatment of TB, and help stem the country's growing TB crisis.

					Recognising the problems arising due to the use of serological  														tests for TB diagnosis, the RNTCP's laboratory committee  														requested India's Central TB Division to disseminate the  														WHO's negative recommendation on serology testing to all  														stakeholders involved in TB control in India. Furthermore, India's  														Ministry of Health and Family Welfare endorsed the WHO's  														stance on TB serological testing and encouraged widespread  														dissemination of the negative recommendation, including  														to civil society actors, so as to make the change a community  														movement <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumar A (Deputy Director General, Head Central TB Division, Project Director RNTCP).

Available from:http://tbcindia.nic.in/pdfs/Letter_Serodiagnosis.pdf" id="28">(28)</a>. This was followed by a ban being implemented  														on the import, sale, manufacture and use of serological tests  														for TB diagnosis in mid&ndash;2012. While these are encouraging  														measures, the Indian government must go further and ensure  														that the ban is implemented strictly, and also clarify its stance  														on the universal provision of second&ndash;line treatment regimens.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also important for the government to institute an efficient  														drug resistance surveillance system in the country, covering  														both public and private providers. Such a system will help  														keep a tab on existing and emerging drug resistance patterns  														in both first&ndash; and second&ndash; line therapy. Availability of such data  														coupled with widespread availability of drug susceptibility  														testing can reduce TB morbidity and mortality by helping  														control the spread of drug resistance. The RNTCP can also  														examine the feasibility of providing individualised treatment to  														patients for whom drug resistance patterns are known.
				</p>
				<h5>Treatment obligations</h5>
				<p>
					Second&ndash;line TB therapy is not widely available through   India's  														public health sector; although it is widely available in   the  														unregulated private sector, albeit at prohibitively high   costs for most people. According to WHO's Stop TB Strategy, "anti&ndash;TB  														drugs should be available free of charge to all TB   patients, both  														because many patients are poor and may find them difficult  														to afford, and because treatment has benefits that extend   to  														society as a whole (cure prevents transmission to others); <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.

Given  														India's split healthcare system, such treatment options are  														more readily accessible through the country's private sector for  														patients able and willing to pay. These factors should not deter  														the Indian government. South Africa provides international  														precedent for a resource&ndash;constrained country with a split  														healthcare system and high&ndash;burden TB, implementing a  														nationwide rollout of Xpertin the public health sector despite  														currently having inadequate second&ndash;line drugs and related  														infrastructure for those diagnosed with Rifampicin resistance <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfour" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Smart T.

India may find itself in a similar position, initially, but this  														should not be a factor against a phased Xpertnationwide  														deployment as soon as is reasonably possible. According to the  														WHO guidance document, countries that implement diagnostic  														testing in the absence of treatment should do so only as a  														temporary measure, and should establish a timetable for when  														treatment for multi&ndash; and extensively drug&ndash;resistant TB will be  														made available. This holds true even for low&ndash;income countries <a class="reference" href="#thirty five" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh JA and Bhan A.

Thus, if a patient in the public health sector is diagnosed  														with a drug&ndash;resistant strain of TB, health authorities would be  														morally (and, in some settings, potentially legally) obliged  														to provide that patient, within a reasonable timeframe, with  														access to efficacious second&ndash;line treatment options.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regardless of whether a rapid, reliable TB diagnostic technology  														is widely adopted in India's private sector before the state  														sector, and regardless of whether a patient has been initiated  														on second&ndash;line TB treatment through the private sector, the  														Indian government is morally obliged to continue providing  														second&ndash;line drugs to these patients, irrespective of their ability  														to afford the treatment themselves after treatment initiation in  														the private sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					India's HIV sector also provides precedent for introducing  														universal access to expensive second&ndash;line drugs. India's National  														AIDS Control Organization, which falls under the auspices of  														India's Health and Family Welfare Ministry, recently announced  														that free second&ndash;line therapy for HIV would be made available  														to all patients who started first&ndash;line therapy before 2004 and  														faced drug resistance, irrespective of whether the first&ndash;line  														therapy was initiated in the public or private sector <a class="reference" href="#thirtysix" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sinha K, Mahapatra D.

India's  														RNTCP should do the same in relation to TB. To this end,   it has laudably committed increased resources to tackling TB, as  														noted above.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Indian government, aside from the support it  														received from other donor partners, the World Bank provided it  														with a credit of US$ 170 million for the period 2006&ndash;2012 for its  														TB management programme, along with additional financing  														of US$ 396 million to support the RNTCP in "meeting its  														ambitious new Universal Access goals, adequately addressing  														the challenge of drug&ndash;resistant TB, and introducing and scalingup  														innovations and new approaches" <a class="reference" href="#seven" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

				</p>
				<p>
					However, increased spending on second&ndash;line TB drugs in India  														should not come at the expense of basic TB control. Instead,  														Indian policymakers must skilfully budget for the progressive  														scale&ndash;up of Xpert(or an equivalent test) and the provision of  														associated second&ndash;line drug regimens, whilst simultaneously  														expanding its universal TB diagnosis and treatment programme.  														Furthermore, as Xpert's (or an equivalent test's) deployment at  														lower levels of the health system may necessitate confirmatory  														testing at higher level laboratories for those at low risk of  														Rifampicin resistance; this will require careful coordination and  														budgeting. Data from the ongoing Xpertfield testing should  														help inform policy decision making in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, should Xpertbe adopted nationwide in India, an  														ethics concern will arise if authorities become aware of drugresistance  														prevalence because of Xpert, but nevertheless  														continue providing patients with sub&ndash;optimal treatment, care,  														and monitoring. Such apathy or inaction on the part of Indian  														authorities could result in "ethics of inaction" criticisms, a  														backlash against India's national TB programme, and jeopardise  														its future success. Policymakers should realise that the promise  														of improved tests could drive treatment uptake, resulting in  														better health outcomes. This could ultimately induce or catalyse  														the development of even better technologies.
				</p>
				<h5>Ethical obligations of the private sector</h5>
				<p>
					While the state must practise ethical TB management in  														India, given the major role that the private sector plays in TB  														management in India, the private sector also has an ethical  														obligation to collaborate with the state in managing India's  														TB epidemic, and should continue its efforts in this regard <a class="reference" href="#twenty three" data&ndash;placement="top" data&ndash;trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dewan PK, Lal SS, Lonnroth K, Wares F, Uplekar M, Sahu S, Granich R, Chauhan LS.

				</p>
				<h5>Negotiating, spurring, and supporting ongoing research</h5>
				<p>
					Barring negative results from its operational research on   Xpert,  														the Indian government must, in collaboration with funders,   advocacy groups and international agencies, robustly negotiate  														lower prices with the makers of the Xpertbased on economy  														of scale given the country's huge TB burden.   Simultaneously, it  														must secure discounted second&ndash;line TB drugs with sustained  														scale&ndash;up in mind; India's strength in generic drug   manufacturing  														should be tapped for this purpose. The Indian government  														should also spur indigenous innovation by promoting and  														incentivising the production of viable alternative   low&ndash;cost, TB  														rapid diagnostic technologies or generic versions of   existing  														technologies, such as Xpert. Such measures will help drive  														down the cost of TB diagnostic technologies and,   hopefully,  														ultimately facilitate the elimination of TB in the   country.  														The Indian government should also encourage ongoing  														operational research that considers various permutations   and  														combinations of new and existing technologies (including  														smear microscopy but excepting serology) to determine the  														optimal mix for the Indian context.

				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>
					Undetected cases of drug&ndash;resistant TB present a significant  														opportunity cost as drug&ndash;resistance incidence and prevalence  														in India amongst those seeking treatment in the public sector  														will remain unknown and unmitigated. As a result, valuable  														public sector resources will be expended on inappropriate  														treatment regimens, and the prevalence of drug&ndash;resistance  														strains of TB will conceivably grow unchecked. The Indian  														government's recent pledge to provide universal access to  														quality TB diagnostics and care to those who need it, and its  														deployment of rapid diagnostics technologies such as line  														probe assay, liquid culture and solid culture in a few centres,  														is to be applauded. However, Xpertoffers the opportunity  														to get more TB patients diagnosed early, at the point of care,  														including those with Rifampicin resistance, and placed on  														therapy to interrupt transmission, than existing technologies  														employed in India. Accordingly, India's government is ethically  														obliged to deploy Xpert, an affordable generic equivalent, or a  														quality lower cost molecular diagnostic alternative, preferably  														made in India, at points of care as soon as reasonably possible.  														Further, the Indian government is ethically obliged to provide  														second&ndash;line TB treatment to those who need it through  														a comprehensive patient care and management system.  														Doing so will realise universal access to quality diagnosis and  														treatment for the entire population. Not only will this have a  														meaningful impact on India's TB epidemic, it will allow India to  														demonstrate inspiring and bold leadership on a major global  														health threat. This could inspire similar reform elsewhere and  														eventually lead to meaningful gains against TB globally.

				<h4>Appendix 1</h4>
				<h5>Summary of the ethical values particularly important to TB care and control</h5>
				<ol>
					<li><em>Social justice/equity</em> &ndash; A focus on social justice
					  calls attention to the underlying root causes and
					  existence of inequalities in society and requires that
					  we explicitly address them. In some cases, this may
					  mean a redistribution of resources to compensate for
					  existing inequalities and further actions to prevent their
				    perpetuation.</li>
					<li><em>Solidarity</em> &ndash; Solidarity is primarily about standing together as a group, community or nation.</li>
					<li><em>Common good</em> &ndash; An infectious disease threatens the health not only of an infected individual, but also of the whole population. The removal or reduction of a threat of infection from a society is therefore something that we can all benefit from. We all gain from a society with strong public health facilities to address TB control and treatment.</li>
					<li><em>Autonomy</em> &ndash; Respect for patient autonomy is generally
					  seen as guaranteeing individuals the right to make
					  decisions about their own lives, including healthcare.
					  Respecting autonomy means that patients generally
					  should have the right to choose among treatment
				    options.</li>
					<li><em>Reciprocity</em> &ndash;Reciprocity seeks to express the idea that
					  those individuals who put themselves at risk of harm
					  for the sake of others deserve benefits in exchange
					  for running such risks. It might include an obligation to
					  minimise the risks to individual care&ndash;givers (by providing
					  protective equipment) as well as positive interventions to
					  treat and compensate individuals when harm occurs as a
				    result of providing care.</li>
					<li><em>Effectiveness</em> &ndash; The idea of effectiveness includes the
					  duty to avoid doing things that are clearly not working,
					  as well as the positive obligation to implement proven
					  measures that are likely to succeed. Effectiveness is
					  linked to the concept of efficiency, which requires that
					  limited resources be used in the most productive manner
				    possible.</li>
					<li><em>Subsidiarity </em>&ndash; This value promotes the idea that
					  decisions should be made as close to the individual and
					  communities at local level as possible. The idea is that
					  this ought to result in decisions reflecting local interests,
					  concerns and beliefs, and ensure the highest possible
				    involvement by the public.</li>
					<li><em>Participation</em> &ndash; This principle requires that the public
					  be encouraged to participate in the decision&ndash;making
				    process, and that reasons be provided for decisions.</li>
					<li><em>Transparency and accountability</em> &ndash;This principle requires that decisions be made in an open manner, and that the decision-making process be fair, responsive and
				    evidence-based.</li>
