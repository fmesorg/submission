					Research ethics is closely related to scientific and  													methodological standards. A research project involving  													human participants is never ethical if it is not scientifically  													and methodologically sound in the first place. Clinical data  													management, despite often being perceived as "just" a  													technical methodological service, plays in fact a key role in  													ensuring that data collected within a medical research are true,  													accurate and reliable; that subjects' privacy and confidentiality  													are duly ensured, and that the study findings will serve the  													interests of individual and public health.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to share and analyse the challenges faced by   clinical  													data managers engaged in North-South and South-South  													collaborative medical research, a meeting was organised in  													Varanasi on March 4-8, 2013, by the Baranas Hindu   University  													together with the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp  													(Belgium), in the framework of the Switching the Poles   network, Association for Data Management In the Tropics (<a href="http://admit.tghn.org/" target="_blank">http://admit.tghn.org/</a>). The workshop was funded by the development  													agency, Belgian Technical Cooperation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The meeting was attended by 18 participants from India,  													Nepal, Cambodia, Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Ghana,  													Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Belgium and the UK. The group spent  													five days together, sharing experiences from the different  													countries and settings, and trying to find together answers to  													the most frequent challenges they face. Such challenges are  													mainly due to the constraints in financial or human resources  													allocated to non-commercial research; the limited availability of  													appropriate tools and technologies, especially when working in  													remote research sites; and the lack of harmonisation, especially  													in multi-site research, or when pooling data from different  													research projects.
