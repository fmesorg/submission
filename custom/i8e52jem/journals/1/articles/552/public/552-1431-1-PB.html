				<h4>Sonia Shah. The body hunters. New York: The New Press; 2006, pp 242, $24.95, ISBN 978-1-56584-912-9</h4>
				<p>
					"There's a lot of money in this, you know," said the director of a contract research organisation while talking to me about a
					clinical trial about a year ago. Unwittingly, he had hit the nail on
					the head and had admitted the real &ndash; and the only &ndash; reason for
					his company's interest in clinical research.
				</p>
				<p>
					That clinical trials and medical research have usually been done
					on the poor and the oppressed is clear to those of us in the
					fields of medical ethics and history of medicine. The only thing
					that is new is the setting: Russia, India and other developing
					nations. Why is it that drug companies wish to outsource their
					trials to the developing world?
				</p>
				<p>
					Shah sets out to get the facts right in this book. She is
					decidedly anti-pharma and this clouds her view. However,
					we learn something surprising from the foreword by John Le
					Carre, author of the chilling book (later made into an equally
					engrossing movie), <em>The Constant Gardener.</em> Le Carre writes
					that many people who planned to write a book exposing the
					harmaceuticals industry, chickened out because they felt it
					was too risky.
				</p>
				<p>
					While pro-outsourcing politicians in the West come under a
					lot of flak from their media, nobody seems to object to clinical
					trials being done elsewhere. The reason for this is simple. The
					cost advantage: it's cheaper to do it in India. This is true for call
					centres as well as for clinical trials &ndash; but what is more important
					is that there is a perception and a reality that it is easier to get
					away with ethically flawed studies here than it is abroad. (Such
					a statement would, of course, hold true even for BT cotton
					trials). Earlier, American physicians often conducted studies on
					African Americans or on convicts. The Tuskegee experiment,
					which traced the effects of untreated syphilis in poor African
					Americans (at a time when treatment was available), is a prime
					example of such practices. After the civil rights movement in
					the US, such experiments became impossible, so it was logical
					to turn to a country with limited resources. Besides, patients in
					developing countries are more likely to provide "events", to use
					the euphemistic term.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book covers the background to today's situation. Shah
					documents the growth of the pharmaceutical industry, the
					Thalidomide incident and the FDA regulations that followed,
					disease-mongering, direct to consumer marketing, and the
					marketing blitz that it involves.
				</p>
				<p>
					The clinical trials that she writes about are splendid examples
					of man's inhumanity to man. Perhaps prime among them is the
					Trovan trial done by Pfizer in Nigeria in 1996. <em>The Washington
					Post</em>, on learning of these trials, which were carried out without
					consent, among other irregularities, carried an expose in
					2000 in a series of articles entitled '<em>The Body Hunters</em>'; the
					title of Shah's book is presumably based on this series. Other
					such trials include the HIV vaccine trials in Africa in 1997 and
					the brouhaha that followed the editorial in the <em>New England
					Journal of Medicine</em>. I also learnt, to my surprise, that the PDR
					(physicians desk reference), which I had assumed was an
					unbiased source of pharmaceutical information, was funded by
					the pharma industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					As one would expect, the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em>,
					some of its editors, and some of the papers published in it, are
					quoted. Yet, I am not sure why the author has failed to quote
					the exact page numbers of articles from this and other journals.
					At least some of the provocative statements are not referenced
					and, in some cases, a secondary source of information is quoted
					rather than the primary source or study. Some statements are
					inconsistent with the facts, such as the one on pages 113-114
					of the book, about the paucity of medical ethics teaching in
					medical schools in India. Shah states on the same page that
					a group of progressive physicians fought the elections for the
					medical council in the late 1980s &ndash; as readers of this journal
					know, this appened in the early 1990s.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though it has some flaws, I believe that this book should be
					read by both, lay people and physicians, because it does not
					seem to have registered with most people, that clinical trials,
					whether outsourced or otherwise, often involve blatantly
					unethical medical practice. There are no easy solutions to this
					problem. But recognition of the existence of the problem is the
					first step towards correction.
