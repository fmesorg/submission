			<h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
				Continuous innovations mark progress in the craft of surgery.  														Throughout history, successes and failures in innovations have  														raised ethical issues. In this article, I discuss the subject based on  														my experience as a paediatric cardiac surgeon. I conclude that  														discussion with peers, openness to criticism, and being mindful  														of the patient's well-being must be considered while innovating,  														and these aspects of the 'medical arts' must be discussed and  														inculcated during medical education.

				Innovations are an integral part of science and the field of  														medicine is no exception. Additionally, the field of surgery --  														and more so paediatric cardiac surgery -- has its unique set  														of challenges. Paediatric cardiac surgery represents, perhaps,  														the toughest of the surgical specialties given that it deals  														with babies. The young age of the speciality itself (roughly  														four decades), the ever increasing dependence on advanced  														technology, the fact that the lives of children are involved,  														and the ambiguity in ethical standards make our profession  														particularly challenging.
			</p>
			<p>
				The field of paediatric cardiac surgery is replete with examples  														of innovation, as well as of courage and sensitivity, born out  														of deep caring for the "blue baby". Many of these innovations,  														dating back to the late 1930s, started off as failures or aborted  														attempts associated with much morbidity and mortality.  														The failed attempt by Streider at ligation of a patent ductus  														arteriosus and the reportedly "surreptitious" successful  														operation of the same type the very next year by Gross when  														his chief was away on vacation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Castaneda AR. Classics in thoracic surgery. Patent ductus arteriosus: a commentary (Robert E. Gross). Ann Thorac Surg. 1981 Jan;31(1):92-6." id="1">(1)</a> drive this point home.</p>
			<p>However, the most remarkable example of pioneering effort  														is the description of the Blalock-Taussig shunt. Taussig and  														Blalock went to extraordinary lengths to test their hypothesis  														in the treatment of tetralogy of fallot on animal models and  														performed the first surgery on an extremely sick child who had  														a poor prognosis. The aftermath of this procedure is a saga of  														cooperation and education of all concerned in the spread of the  														knowledge and skills of paediatric cardiac surgery. The surgical  														and the medical cardiology teams involved in the BT shunt  														operations willingly gave their time for talks at medical and  														surgical meetings and accommodated the many doctors who  														came to observe the coordination of paediatric cardiac and  														surgical care. Dr Taussig analysed not only the many successes  														of the operations but also their failures and Dr Blalock received  														these as valuable learning information. This cooperative model  														is the recipe for successful paediatric cardiac care teams all over  														the world today.</p>
			<p>In this article, I present a personal example to discuss the  														various scientific, ethical, and emotional issues that innovation  														presents for the surgeon.</p>
			<p>I still remember, sadly but vividly, a child who had a complex  														form of tetralogy of fallot. This was around 1995. We had read  														an authoritative European article that described a technique  														in which total correction of the malformed heart had been  														performed. We were greatly impressed with the technique and  														its success since it corrected the complex problem without  														using a conduit, thereby reducing morbidity and costs.  														However, our surgery was unsuccessful and we lost the child.  														Looking back, we realised the flaws in the technique. But the  														loss was irreplaceable for all of us. Several incidents like this  														have repeatedly made us realise that often complications arise  														due to our lack of complete knowledge of the child.</p>
			<p>Though application of a new technique, or improvement on  														an old technique while performing surgery, is a necessity, an  														unexpected failure can mean a loss of life. Given the number of  														variables in each child, whether an improvisation or innovation  														was necessary in a particular child with a congenital heart  														defect is a difficult question to answer. This is especially so  														when one is contemplating the improvisation during the  														course of the operation. Any delay between conceptualisation  														and execution would result in increasing the time of cardiopulmonary  														bypass and the cross clamp time. This would  														directly affect the morbidity and risk to the life of the child. At  														the same time, denial of that improvisation/innovation would  														amount to denial of appropriate and precise care to the child.</p>
			<p>The following text represents the sum of my thoughts  														concerning the dilemmas we face as surgeons in our  														professional lives. My colleague, a paediatric cardiologist,  														brought to me a family with a four-month-old child. The child  														was rather underweight and was breathing quite fast. Her chest  														was prominent. The family had come to our centre in South  														India all the way from Gujarat. Despite the tiresome journey, the  														parents' anxiety and apprehensions concerning their precious  														baby were very evident. They were devastated to learn that  														their child had a serious heart problem that required a complex  														surgery.</p>
			<p>
				Alien to the culture, customs, food habits and language of   the  														southern Indian city, they had arrived in the fond hope   that  														we were going to treat the problem as we were considered  														experts in this field. Unfortunately, what they did not   know  														was that science itself had not mastered this unique   problem.  														The abnormal communication between the left and right  														hearts (cardiac type of total anomalous pulmonary venous  														connection, with severe obstruction at the vertical vein   to coronary sinus junction) was further complicated by the  														narrowness of the communication that was at the back of   the  														heart. It was considered an extremely dangerous area that  														was close to the coronary arteries and inaccessible. While   we  														had acquired the knowledge to address the connection, we  														had not learnt to increase the size of the connection and   that  														was going to be the deciding factor in long-term success   as  														more than half of such children would have, to a large   extent,  														persistent residual problems. The disastrous consequences  														for the last child operated on by my colleague were still   fresh  														in my mind. I knew we had to sort this out. The idea that   we  														had to do something in addition to the conventional   technique  														kept coming back to me repeatedly, over the next two days  														till surgery. During the operation, we had to find a   solution  														that eliminated this narrowing. We admitted the child and   we  														performed all the necessary preoperative tests.
			</p>
			<p>
				That necessity is the mother of invention actually struck me  														on the day of surgery while I was preparing to leave for the  														hospital. Soon after I reached the hospital, I tried discussing this  														with my team members. Most of them, except for my colleague  														who had brought the family to me, could not comprehend that  														I could actually fix the problem with the improvisation I had  														thought of. But, we worried about the potential haemorrhage  														if this solution were tried. The sole supporter of this venture  														was my cardiology colleague, a person of impeccable character  														and integrity. That gave me the necessary courage to venture  														into the uncharted territory. My other colleagues' concerns  														were genuine and their reluctance to endorse this surgical  														improvisation was understandable, given the complex surgery  														and the element of uncertainty in doing something new and  														untested. However, to me, my cardiologist's firm belief in our  														approach and my own conviction were far more overpowering.
			</p>
			<p>
				I discussed the complexity of the situation with the parents, to  														the best extent possible and they " as is always the case" left  														it to our wisdom.
			</p>
			<p>
				We performed the surgery with a plan outlined in my mind  														and the child did exceedingly well. We published the case in  														a prestigious journal <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Koshy S, Shivaprakasha K. Novel repair for obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to coronary sinus. Ann Thorac Surg. 2005 Feb; 79(2): 711-3." id="2">(2)</a> and now it has become a standard  														operation for this complex surgery. In fact, we won many  														accolades for this as we presented our experience at major  														international conferences. Now, every time I see this wonderful  														child (now attending school) on follow-up, I feel exhilarated  														that our idea helped us address one of the most important  														and complex problems in congenital heart surgery.
			</p>
			<p>
				This incident illustrates the success of an idea that   germinated  														out of necessity but lacked support of prior clinical   experience.  														I have wondered several times, as we keep innovating in   our  														specialty, whether we did right to apply these untested   ideas  														to clinical settings. Apart from my conviction and reason,   what  														else had I to support the experiment? My colleague's   support, a  														widened knowledge base, the prevailing imperfect   treatment,  														the fact that the child's family was not very enlightened   about  														the treatment, or the plain and simple fact that the child   could  														not disagree with me? How does the law of the land react   to  														this? Perhaps none of us has satisfying answers to the   questions I have raised. More importantly, my conscience continues to   ask  														me whether it was correct on my part to have done that.
			</p>
			<p>
				No red line exists that distinguishes innovation from  														misadventure. The consequence of our actions --" either  														benefitting the child or endangering it defines it one  														way or the other. Did we abuse faith, and confuse lack of  														accountability with the opportunity to innovate? On the other  														hand, let us also acknowledge that, for science to progress,  														it needs to evolve and move beyond time-tested paradigms.  														This warrants scrutiny in our field as it is very young and still  														evolving, unlike other medical specialities.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I look back at my own experiences, I think I developed  														conviction not only from my own knowledge base but  														also from the terrific faith and confidence of my cardiology  														colleagues and other peers in my ability to convert ideas into  														action. Critics and colleagues participated in improving and  														implementing the idea. I think being transparent, ethical and  														communicative while maintaining a sound knowledge base  														helped my situation. Perhaps there lies the solution to the  														dilemma we face. What we do or do not do should have the  														sanction of our colleagues and peers. Discussing with them  														not only raises the possibility of acceptance of our efforts but  														may also refine the idea further. The most ardent critic of our  														ideas perhaps unknowingly becomes the biggest supporter of  														our endeavour and the saviour of the patient as criticism draws  														out the flaws in ideas. That applies more in my field than in any  														other speciality in medicine. I have never ceased to learn from  														the frailties and challenges of my profession.
			</p>
			<p>
				The partnership of courage and conviction is vital to the  														development and conversion of an idea into action. In  														my opinion, courage is required, not just as "grace under  														pressure" but as a necessary attribute. The surgeon is faced  														with significant challenge and dilemma as his /her reputation  														and character are at stake while executing the idea. There  														have been instances in the history of medicine where one  														unsuccessful act ruined the doctor's career. This is probably the  														reason that few failures are published.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am making this statement on the basis of a series of  														innovations that we published <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shivaprakasha K. Simplified double barrel repair with autologous pericardium for tetralogy of fallot with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus and anomalous coronary crossing right ventricular outflow. Ana Pediatr Cardiol. 2008 Jan;1(1): 34-7. doi: 10.4103/0974-2069.41053." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shivaprakasha K, Rameshkumar I, Kumar RK, Nair SG, Koshy S, Sunil GS, Rao SG. New technique of right heart bypass in congenital heart surgeries with autologus lung as oxygenator. Ann Thorac Surg. 2004 Mar; 77(3):988- 93." id="4">4)</a> which several others have  														reproduced. We draw redemption from it. Finally, that is what  														vindicates our claim.
			</p>
			<p>
				As John Gribbin stated in his book Science: a history,"Scientific  														progress has been made in the most part by ordinary  														clever people building step-by-step from the work of their  														predecessors" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gribbin J. Science: A History.2001; Penguin Books.p12." id="5">(5)</a>.</p>
			<p>
				Let us also not forget that in the process we also helped  														science take small steps to be better for the next child with a  														similar problem. When we are unsuccessful in our endeavour,  														we end up learning, as a team &ndash; albeit at a great cost &ndash; and it  														is important that we do not repeat the errors. That is where  														our character and integrity as responsible doctors are tested. I  														must however confess that the awareness of our responsibility  														continues to grow as we become seniors in our field and I wish  														those qualities had come to me earlier.</p>
			<p>
				We live in a world that is becoming too ready to litigate -- and  														where healthcare is expensive and presents a large number  														of choices. All those children's cases in which we tried our  														innovative ideas represented a challenge to existing and  														universally accepted treatments. But each time we toy with a  														new idea, we need to ask whether it conforms to the framework  														of ethical and legal behaviour. Failure in our attempts to  														convert an idea into a successful action does not achieve the  														desired objective of progress in science; it also means that our  														idea was flawed. Moreover it endangers a life. Hence these  														errors need to be addressed if further mishaps and loss of lives  														are to be prevented.</p>
			<p>
				Dissatisfaction with the inadequate and curiosity to   innovate  														may be innate to the few. Maybe it can be inculcated in   others  														by inspired teachers. But the great responsibility that   comes  														with this -- of being able to keep the interests of the   patient  														foremost, not personal glory, not even the progress of   science -- requires the qualities of honesty, openness, willingness to  														share and discuss ideas, as well as the ability to give   and take  														criticism, and accept failure with grace. Our current   medical education does not prepare us for this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps early and continuous exposure during medical school  														training to the history of medicine, medical ethics and western  														and Indian literature with an undercurrent of these ideas will  														go some way towards preparing students. Medical teachers  														who are role models will have a huge impact in propagating  														these qualities among generations of students and doctors.</p>
