					<strong>YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education</strong> (YRG CARE)
					is a non-governmental organization based in Chennai, India,

					providing a comprehensive range of services for persons
					living with HIV/AIDS. It functions in a hospital setting and
					conducts socio-behavioural research studies and clinical trials
					on HIV/AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					YRG CARE conducted <em>The YRG CARE Bioethics Symposium (TYBS)</em> in collaboration with the National Institute of Epidemiology
					(NIE), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Chennai,
					through the National Institutes of Health Project "Centrally
					Coordinated Bioethics Education for India" and the National
					Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), ICMR, Chennai
					on January 6, 2013. TYBS was co-sponsored by Public
					Responsibility in Medicine and Research (PRIM&amp;:R), Boston,
					USA, and ICMR, New Delhi. The theme of TYBS 2013 was
					"Empowerment of research participants/patients."
				</p>
				<p>
					Seventy-seven delegates attended TYBS, including speakers,
					clinicians, researchers, persons working in the pharmaceutical
					sector, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), ethics
					committee/institutional review board (IRB) members, ethics
					committee/IRB personnel and students.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <strong>Welcome Address</strong> was delivered by <strong>Dr Suniti Solomon</strong>,
					Director of YRG CARE and Chairperson of TYBS 2013. She spoke
					about how ethics had grown over the years since she was a
					student.
				</p>
				<p>
					In her opening remarks, <strong>Dr Soumya Swaminathan</strong>, Scientist
					'G' and Director, NIRT, Chennai said that a concerted effort has
					to be made to ensure that the <strong>participants and patients are
					empowered</strong>, in line with the theme of the symposium. The
					challenge is in following ethics in spirit and not just in letter.
					Most of the time, participants are unable to comprehend the
					complexity of research. The autonomy of participants cannot
					be violated. They should be asked for permission and informed
					about the research, including its uncertainties, in the simplest
					and best possible way.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Sanjay Mehendale</strong>, director, National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai and principal investigator, NIH Bioethics Project, National Institute of Epidemiology, ICMR, Chennai spoke on "<strong>Community participation in clinical research related to HIV/AIDS: the Pune experience</strong>." He shared his experience as principal investigator (PI) for studies at the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) in Pune, which required the establishment of a community advisory board (CAB). The composition of the CAB has grown to include doctors, women
					activists, and educationists, men who have sex with men (MSM),
					students and sexual minorities. The CAB now participates
					in carrying out review of protocols and reviews translation
					and back translation of informed consent documents and
					questionnaires. It helps in building relationships between NGOs,
					community-based organisations (CBOs) and researchers, and
					helps in alleviating rumours regarding clinical trials. In addition, NARI had developed a community involvement plan through
					NGO partnerships to help volunteer recruitment in phases 2
					and 3 of clinical trials. NGO partnership gives a lot of visibility and acceptance of the institution and the project in the community. It is important to specifically inform people about the subtle differences between health literacy and research
					literacy. Dr Mehendale also spoke about the right way to reach
					the media for research projects to ensure support for sensitive
					projects such as HIV vaccine trials. He said that community
					involvement is a cost-intensive effort that requires careful
					budgeting, as people's time cannot be taken for granted.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Tal Burt</strong>, Scientific Director, Duke Global Proof-of-Concept (POC) Research Network, Duke Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) and Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI), Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, spoke on <strong>The PARTAKE
					initiative: public awareness of research for therapeutic
					advancements through knowledge and empowerment</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					He said that the PARTAKE initiative covers the different
					stakeholders involved in clinical research in India&mdash;academia,
					clinicians, government, media, industry, public, and patients.
					There may be communication problems between them as
					the public, patients, and media are ranged on one side and
					industry, academia, clinicians and regulatory bodies on the
					other. He explained the goals, objectives, and components of
					the PARTAKE initiative
				</p>
				<p>
					On the media's negative projection of research, and whether
					organisations should take steps to project positive issues
					in research, Dr Burt said that research is based on trust, and
					PARTAKE needs all stakeholders to come together.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Sunil Shroff</strong>, Professor and Head, Urology and Transplantation, Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, spoke on <strong>Organ transplantation and
					ethical dilemmas</strong>. He spoke about the types of organ donors;
					and using examples, elaborated on ethics in organ donation,
					whether compensation is justified, the ethics of using stem cells
					in organ donation and policy issues. He said that in India we
					have no laws in place to embrace the current advancements in
					science. Most laws are in the form of ICMR guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr MS Jawahar</strong>, Scientist 'F', National Institute for Research in
					Tuberculosis, Chennai and Member, Ethics Committee spoke on
					<strong>Ethical issues in clinical trials.</strong> He discussed the registration of clinical trials with the Clinical Trials Registry of India, and proceeded to talk about the different types of study designs. He elaborated on the different phases of clinical trials and what is tested during a clinical trial, the milestones in research ethics development, the different international and national ethical guidelines, and the international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use - good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines. He spoke on the different dimensions of vulnerability, special considerations and issues in drug trials. He concluded that there should be stringent regulations governing clinical trials, so that the rights and welfare of the human participants are protected.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Saradha Suresh</strong>, HOD and Professor of Paediatrics, Madras
					Medical College, Chennai and Member, YRG CARE Institutional
					Review Board spoke on <strong>Ethical aspects in paediatric
					clinical trials</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Paediatric research covers the age group from newborn to 18
					years, and has to consider aspects such as physical growth and
					neurological, emotional and social development. Paediatric
					research involves the vulnerable population with diminished
					autonomy. She said that there should be inbuilt monitoring of
					paediatric research projects by the ethics committee. Children
					cannot be treated as a commodity and traded away for
					research by parents. Assent form should be made mandatory
					after seven years of age.
				</p>
				<p>
					On whether there are any legal or ethical guidelines for
					paediatric research in India, Dr Suresh said that in India
					sociocultural behaviour is different in different places, and is
					not uniformly applicable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Shailesh Mehta</strong>, Vice President, Clinical R&amp;:D, Medical Affairs
					Biologicals South Asia, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals
					Ltd., Mumbai spoke on <strong>Ethical dilemmas faced by the
					pharmaceutical industry in clinical trials.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					He spoke about patent rights versus patients' rights. Drugs are unaffordable for the patients in whose country the research is conducted. It is essential to strengthen the regulatory
					framework in the country. The issue of conflict of interest
					is essential and requires transparency. He discussed the
					importance of making the trial data public. It is very important
					to publish the scientific findings, even if the results are not
					favorable. Dr Mehta spoke about the scientific engagement
					policy introduced by GSK which completely segregates
					sponsorship from research and marketing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Nandini Kumar</strong>, Co-Investigator, NIH Bioethics Project,
					National Institute of Epidemiology, ICMR, Chennai &amp;: Organizing
					Co-Chair, TYBS spoke on <strong>The ethics of care and related
					gender issues</strong> Ethics of care includes both "caring of" and
					"caring for." She discussed the general and specific aspects
					of health issues pertaining to women, to include gender
					disparities, feminism, feminist bioethics and contemporary
					feminism.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a panel discussion on "Compensation for
					participation in research projects." The panel was moderated
					by <strong>Mr SS Narayanan</strong>, member, Ethics Committee, National
					Institute of Epidemiology, ICMR, Chennai. Panelists were Dr
					Nandini Kumar, Mr B Ramesh, Member, YRG CARE Community
					Advisory Board and Dr Shailesh Mehta. The <strong>legal aspects
					of compensation</strong> and how it is perceived in the West and
					in India were discussed. Mr Sankaranarayanan stated it is
					necessary to have a specific policy for compensation in clinical
					trials. Dr Nandini said that the US should also have policies on
					compensation as in India. Dr Shailesh Mehta said that in GSK,
					for all new studies, a death clause is inserted along with details
					on the compensation. Mr Ramesh said that in his work with
					injecting drug users (IDUs) in the community, the IDUs fear to
					join any clinical trial as the antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs
					prescribed affects their liver.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr S Swarnalakshmi S</strong>, IRB Manager, YRG CARE and Organizing
					Secretary, TYBS 2013, spoke on PRIM&amp;:R, which had co-sponsored the symposium through the regional connections programme. She gave an overview on <strong>PRIM&R and opportunities
					for professional development</strong> offered by PRIM&amp;:R. She spoke
					about PRIM&amp;:R's online training course for IRB members - <em>Ethical Oversight of Human Subjects Research</em> and the certifications
					provided by PRIM&amp;:R.
				</p>
				<p>
					The closing remarks were delivered by Dr Nandini Kumar. Dr S
					Swarnalakshmi proposed a vote of thanks.
				</p>
