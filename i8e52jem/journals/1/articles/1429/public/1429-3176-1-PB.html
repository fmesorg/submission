				<h4>Forcible discharge of TB patients</h4>
				<p>
					On August 31, 2000, the Union Health Minister announced a "fervent  resolve" to reach health care to every family in the country <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Menon Sreelatha: Thakur promises health care facilities to all. Indian Express August 2, 2000." id="1">(1)</a>. The same day,  a group of Indore residents submitted a memorandum to the minister against the  forcible eviction of 70 out of 75 patients in a well-attended TB sanatorium in  Indore, to make the land available for an Indian Institute of Management.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next day, the finance minister left for the US for, among other things, a  "routine kidney ailment" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ENS Economic Bureau: FM goes to US for medical treatment. Indian Express August 2, 2000" id="2">(2)</a>. The TB patients have been less lucky following  their "non-routine" discharge. At least one of them is untraceable, and one - a  sputum positive, multi-drug resistant case - was last seen living (or dying) on  a railway station platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					The move to close down the sanatorium &mdash; and the agitation against this &mdash; goes  back to 1998 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Writ Petition no. 483/98 (filed in March 1998). Writ petition 1816/98 (November 1998), Writ petition 1040/2000 (May 2000)." id="3">(3)</a>. At the time, the state government gave an undertaking not to  transfer the land to the IIM "without first fully establishing (the TB  sanatorium) in its new premises, which will be equal to or better than the  present ones". Despite this undertaking, in November 1998, the government  directed sanatorium authorities to discharge all patients and vacate the land  and building &mdash; without setting up any alternative facility. Its efforts were  thwarted by residents of the adjoining village who later also had the support  of a court order maintaining the status quo.
				</p>
				<p>
					This year, as pressure for expediting the IIM built up, sanatorium admissions  were stopped despite the stay. On August 11, ambulances arrived to remove the  female patients, but they refused to leave and complained at the local police  station. Still, from August 12 to 17, 51 patients were discharged -simply by  declaring they were OK or writing "discharged on request" in English on their  discharge slips (in a sanatorium where most patients cannot read English) &mdash; and  escorted off the premises. Even as villagers obtained another court stay and  prominent citizens submitted a memorandum to the collector, police arrived at the  sanatorium to "facilitate" further discharges out of the 24 remaining patients.  On August 18, only 5 patients remained.
				</p>
				<p>
					The villagers sought action against this contempt of court, and on September 8,  the court ordered re-admissions. However, sanatorium authorities plead their  "inability" to admit patients since they had not received official instructions  following the latest court order.
				</p>
				<p>
					On September 14 - nearly a week after the court directed re-admissions and in  the midst of extensive media coverage on Vajpayee's knee and Kumaramangalam's  diagnosis - 45-year-old Bhagwandas, one of the patients discharged in August,  died just inside the sanatorium. He had been camping outside the gates for  three days, but had been refused admission by the sanatorium management. He had  been moved "just inside" the previous evening, because he was gasping for  breath and crying for help. At dawn, Bhagwandas died.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sanatorium is still in the local news. One section of the medical community  is saying that TB sanatoriums are irrelevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					The administration,  which is mandated to take care of public health and public health institutions,  says the sanatorium is just an old building. The IIM is threatening to leave  Indore if it is not quickly given its land free of "encumbrances". It promises  plans for rural development and primary education but not unglamorous health  care for TB patients. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh Sudhir K: IIM Indore may close shop on land issue. The Times of India August 14, 2000" id="4">(4)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					While much of the national media has maintained a studied silence on the  matter, a leading national daily stated: "IIM Indore being killed by TB  sanatorium." <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Times of India News Service: IIM Indore is being killed, says director. The Times of India August 17, 2000" id="5">(5)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					What, then, shall we say killed Bhagwandas? TB compounded by contempt of court  and all round callousness?
