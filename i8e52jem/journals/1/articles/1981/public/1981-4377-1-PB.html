				<h4>MFC annual meet 2002: Nutrition and food security</h4>
				<p>
					The  recent developments in Orissa have again brought 	into focus the fact that  food security in India is, at the best of times, precarious. All too often, the  familiar picture of overflowing grain stores and starving people is invoked.  India by all accounts appears to have attained self-sufficiency in food production  with overflowing food stocks and the ability to avert large-scale famines. Yet,  apart from crises during which there are severe food shortages and deaths,  there is evidence that a large proportion of children are malnourished and that  there has been little improvement in the nutritional status of vast sections of  people. Policy changes over the last decade &mdash; liberalisation and WTO  requirements including measures such as removal of quota restrictions, changes  in cropping patterns &mdash; are likely to significantly affect food security. There  are fears that such policies will aggravate the situation of poverty and  unemployment, diminishing people's capacity to feed themselves adequately. This  raises many issues that impinge on many disciplines, necessitating debate that  cuts across a range of sectors and activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to bring  together the evidence and enable discussion, the Medico Friend Circle (MFC) has  organised a meeting on this theme. The Annual Meet-2002 of the MFC to be held  at Sewagram, Wardha on <strong>January 24-26, 2002</strong>, will focus on nutrition and  food security.
				</p>
				<p>
					MFC is an all-India  group of socially conscious individuals from diverse backgrounds, who come  together because of a common concern about the health problems in the country.  MFC includes medical, public health and social science professionals as well as  researchers and students, community health and gender activists. It is a  loosely knit and informal national organisation. Annual meetings usually on a  theme have been a regular feature of its activities. MFC does not receive any  funding and is funded and managed entirely by its members on a voluntary basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Annual Meet  2002 will focus on the following issues:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Status of nutrition/malnutrition in India:  evidence from recent data;
					</li>
					<li>
						Health impact of under-nutrition and  inadequate nutrition;
					</li>
					<li>
						Review of nutrition interventions and related  public policy issues: Public distribution system, Integrated Child Development  Scheme, Mid-Day meal schemes, etc.;
					</li>
					<li>
						Review of nutrition education in  India;
					</li>
					<li>
						Wages and employment and issues in nutrition;

					The emphasis will  be on field level studies and empirical evidence from different parts of the  country as much as on issues emerging from more formal research studies. The  object of this meet as in other MFC meets will be to facilitate understanding  which participants can 'take back' from the meet and apply in their immediate  work.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, written  papers/paper presentation is not a prerequisite for participation at MFC meets.  We would like to invite all interested activists, scholars, professionals and  students to attend the meet.
