			<h3>Are tomorrow's doctors aware of the code of medical ethics? </h3>
			<h4 class="author">Arun Babu T ,Venkatesh C, Sharmila V </h4>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the awareness of the 'ethical code of conduct for medical practitioners' among medical undergraduate students.
				</P>
				<p>
					Setting:Tertiary care medical college and hospital.
				</p>
				<p> Materials and methods: This study covered 172 medical students
					in a private medical school in Pondicherry, located in southern
					India. They were administered a questionnaire, containing ten
					scenarios, which was based on the 'medical code of ethics' as set
					out in the chapters on 'unethical acts' and 'misconduct' of the
					Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and
					Ethics) Regulations, 2002. The students were given the option of
					responding with a 'yes,' 'no' or 'don't know'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Results: Only 128 (74.4%) of the 172 medical undergraduates
					enrolled in the study returned the completed questionnaire.
					None of them answered all the questions correctly. The overall
					mean score was 6.13 out of 10, with a SD of 1.36. There were no
					significant differences between second-, third- or final-year
					students. There was no significant difference in the performance
					of boys and girls. Most of the students erred in scenarios related to
					decision-making and communication.
				</P>
				<p>
					Conclusion: There are major deficiencies in the understanding of
					medical ethics among medical undergraduates. Including medical
					ethics as a mandatory and separate subject in the first few years of
					under graduation can help students understand and follow ethical
					principles.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>

				<p>
					The Medical Council of India (MCI), the apex regulatory body
					for the regulation of medical education in India, requires
					medical graduates to become exemplary citizens and respond
					to national aspirations by observing the mores of medical
					ethics, and fulfilling social and professional obligations <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India. Salient features of regulations on graduate medical education, Gazette of India, part III, section 4[Internet]. New Delhi:MCI;1997 May 17[cited 2013 May 20]. Available from: http://www.mciindia.org/RulesandRegulations/GraduateMedicalEducationRegulations1997.aspx" id="1">(1)</a>. The
					fact that the council was dissolved, and its president removed
					unceremoniously in 2010 on charges of corruption, makes
					us believe that the preachers themselves never followed the
					'code of ethics' <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chatterjee P. Trouble at the Medical Council of India. Lancet. 2010 May 15;375(9727):1679." id="2">(2)</a>. Such happenings have an enormous impact
					on the minds of medical students, in that they can influence
					them to embrace unethical behaviour. The existence of major
					conflicts between what is preached and what is practised can
					make it extremely difficult for tomorrow's doctors to 'believe in'
					and imbibe medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though medical ethics is not a separate subject, it is being
					taught as a part of Forensic Medicine in the second year of the
					MBBS <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India. Salient features of regulations on graduate medical education, Gazette of India, part III, section 4[Internet]. New Delhi:MCI;1997 May 17[cited 2013 May 20]. Available from: http://www.mciindia.org/RulesandRegulations/GraduateMedicalEducationRegulations1997.aspx" id="1">(1)</a>. However, most students view it as something they need to know merely to pass their examinations. They do not
					see it in terms of mandatory and statutory regulations that can
					safeguard doctors and their patients. The purpose of this study
					is to highlight awareness regarding the 'ethical code of conduct
					for medical practitioners' among medical undergraduate
					students.
				</p>

				<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p >
					A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Sri Lakshmi
					Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences in July 2010. A total of
					172 medical students in various years of undergraduate studies,
					barring the first year, were enrolled randomly. Following pretesting
					in a small group, a questionnaire on medical ethics,
					based on the chapters on 'unethical acts' and 'misconduct' in
					the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and
					Ethics) Regulations, 2002, was administered to the students.
					In the questionnaire, the students were presented with 10
					scenarios and asked whether these were ethical (Questionnaire
					1). They were given the option of responding with a 'yes', 'no' or
					'don't know'. The demographic details gathered included age,
					sex and year in medical college.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study was conducted in compliance with the "Ethical
					principles for medical research involving human subjects"
					section of the Helsinki Declaration. Verbal consent was
					obtained from all the participants before the administration
					of the questionnaire and their anonymity was maintained.
					Clearance was obtained from the institute's ethics council. Data
					entry and analysis were done using SPSS for Windows Version
					SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).The mean &#177; SD scores of
					students were compared using unpaired t test.
				</P>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p >
					Only 128 (74.4%) of the 172 students enrolled in the study
					returned the completed questionnaire. Ten of the response
					sheets were incomplete and were excluded. Of the 118
					students who were finally included, 45 were male and the rest
					(73) female. Thirty-two students were in the second MBBS and
					43 each in the third and final MBBS. The characteristics of the
					sample are shown in Table 1. None of the individuals could
					answer all 10 questions correctly. The maximum number of
					questions answered correctly was eight out of ten. The 10
					scenarios presented, the expected correct responses and
					percentage of correct responses are given in Table 2. The
					maximum rate of correct responses (more than 50%) was to
					questions 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 9. For the remaining questions, the
					correct response rate was less than 50%. The overall mean
					score was 6.13, with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.362. The mean scores for second-, third- and final-year students were
					6.19, 5.95 and 6.26, with an SD of 1.330, 1.447 and 1.311,
					respectively. There were no significant differences between
					second-, third- and final-year students (p = 0.568). The mean
					scores for boys and girls were 6.42 and 5.95, with a SD of 1.234
					and 1.413, respectively. There were no significant differences in
					the performance of boys and girls ( p = 0.64).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p >
					Our study had a skewed sex ratio (male: female = 1:1.6),
					probably because more male students did not return the
					response sheets. Most medical students were clear about
					the fact that acts of self-advertisement and the prescription
					of unknown drug compounds are unethical. This is a healthy
					sign. Many students also indicated that doctors should display
					their registration numbers on their prescriptions, maintain
					medical records for three years and refuse gifts or favours from
					medical representatives. However, most students were unaware
					that physicians should not own or be associated with open
					pharmacies, should not perform mercy killing on the basis of
					unilateral decisions, and should not conceal signs of domestic
					violence to protect the assailant or prevent marital discord.
					Most students were also unaware that disclosing a patient's
					secrets is ethical when these pose a risk, which is serious and
					has been identified, to a specific person. Although the students
					were aware of the important issues, the majority of them
					were unclear about matters related to decision-making and
					communication, which are important in the practice of ethical
					medicine. The results of this study indicate clearly that medical
					students are not fully aware of what is required of them by
					society in terms of being good doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					The objective of ethics education in medical schools is to
					impress upon the student the moral nature of the art and
					science of medicine and to sensitise the learner to ethical
					issues <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chattopadhyay S. Teaching ethics in an unethical setting: doing nothing is neither good nor right. Indian J Med Ethics. 2009 Apr-Jun;6(2):93-6." id="3">(3)</a>. It is not only medical students who lack knowledge
					of the medical code of ethics, but doctors as well <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brogen AS, Rajkumari B, Laishram J, Joy A. Knowledge and attitudes of doctors on medical ethics in a teaching hospital, Manipur. Indian J Med Ethics. 2009 Oct-Dec;6(4):194-7." id="4">(4)</a>. To
					produce doctors who are aware of the ethical aspects of
					medicine, medical ethics should be introduced as a separate
					and compulsory discipline in the undergraduate curriculum
					and it should be mandatory for students to pass the subject
					before they graduate from medical school. In order to get a
					degree, students should be required to pass an examination
					in the subject by securing the minimum stipulated marks.
					Otherwise, they may not take it seriously <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gillon R. Medical ethics education. J Med Ethics 1987 Sep;13(3):115-6." id="5">(5)</a>. Making ethics an
					elective course in medical schools has not been found to fulfil
					the basic objectives of such courses <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burling SJ, Lumley JS, McCarthy LS, Mytton JA, Nolan JA, Sissou P, Williams DG, Wright LJ.

				</P>
				<p>
					The concept of introducing medical ethics in the curriculum
					has been criticised in certain quarters. Leget points out that
					the 'evasion of ethics teaching' is a major obstacle that needs
					to be overcome <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leget C. Avoiding evasion: Medical ethics education and emotion theory. J Med Ethics. 2004 Oct;30(5):490-3." id="7">(7)</a>. Many educationalists believe that ethics
					has got more to do with the overall moral development of the
					individual and can be difficult to impart through instruction
					in the later years of a person's life. Some common arguments
					against the view that ethics should be taught are that there are
					no absolutely right or wrong answers in the sphere of ethics (scepticism) and that a person can justify whatever he feels is
					right (subjectivism) <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Perkins HR, Geppert CMA, Hazuda HP. Challenges in teaching ethics in medical schools. Am J Med Sci. 2000 May;319(5):273-8." id="8">(8)</a>. Though academicians' opinions are
					divided, we find that in this era characterised by a boom in
					private-sector medical education, there is an emerging trend
					towards the dilution of the ethical principles that have been
					the cornerstone of the doctor-patient relationship all these
					years.

				<p >
					There is a growing awareness of the need to include medical
					ethics as a major subject in the regular undergraduate
					curriculum. Many universities have already started working on
					the development of an ethics curriculum. The Indian Council
					of Medical Research (ICMR) is also planning to introduce a
					certificate and master's course in medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran GD. Medical ethics education in India. Indian J Med Ethics. 2008 Jan-Mar;5(1): 18-19." id="9">(9)</a>. The MCI, in
					whatever form it may be reconstituted in the future, should not limit itself to 'advocating ethical principles', but also introduce
					credible measures for the 'enforcement' of these principles with
					an iron hand.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					There are major deficiencies in the understanding of medical
					ethics among medical undergraduates. This can be rectified
					partly by teaching ethics as a separate subject. It should be
					taught as a mainstream subject during the first few years of
					under graduation. Role play and other methods of teaching
					can be used to teach the subject effectively.. Medical teachers
					should set an example for the undergraduates by practising
					medicine ethically. Ultimately, the onus of understanding
					the principles of ethics and incorporating these into clinical
					practice lies on the medical students.
