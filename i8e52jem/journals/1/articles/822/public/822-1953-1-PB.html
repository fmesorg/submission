					This  essay presents a brief discussion on ethical review of biomedical research in  India, and problems that need to be addressed. Given the paucity of published  material on this subject, it depends on informal exchanges with researchers,  academicians and members of ethics committees during various training sessions  on research ethics.

				<h4>Limitations  of ethical review in India</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex agency guiding  biomedical research involving human participants in India, has published  detailed guidelines on the composition and responsibilities of Institutional  Ethics Committees or IECs <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical Review Procedures in Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects. New Delhi: Indian Council of Medical Research 2000; pp 9-16." id="1">(1)</a>. Despite these guidelines, more than 50% of  institutions conducting research in India reportedly lack formal IECs <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmad K. Developing countries need effective ethics review committees. Lancet 2003;362:627." id="2">(2)</a>. It  is apparently difficult to get external members to volunteer, especially from  among trained legal scholars and ethicists. Most medical schools do not offer  bioethics courses. Typically, well-known people are nominated as IEC members.  Finally, in the Indian context, 'lay persons' can be intimidated by the  presence of more powerful scientific members.
				</p>
				<p>
					Institutional  budgets seldom allocate resources for IECs. Many IECs do not have sufficient  office space. There have been instances of protocols disappearing after the  project's approval. The IEC secretary can be a middle or lower level staff or  faculty member for whom this responsibility is in addition to a full workload.  There are no post-approval monitoring systems in place, and IECs'  responsibilities tend to end with approval. Without standard operating  procedures, the IECs may follow different methods for submission, approval and  follow up of research.
				</p>

				<h4>The  politics of research</h4>
				<p>
					For medical researchers the world over, publishing research in peer-reviewed  journals is a vehicle for career advancement. When ethical review and  monitoring are weak, researchers may be under pressure to cut corners. Pharmaceutical  companies hire practising doctors as researchers for their prescribing  potentials. Hyder, Kass and Dawson note that 'the majority of developing  country researchers were middle-aged males who were physicians employed by  educational institutions, carrying out research on a part-time basis' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hyder AA, Wali SA, Khan AN, Teoh NB, Kass NE, Dawson L. Ethical review of health research: a perspective from developing country researchers. J Med Ethics 2004;30:68-72." id="3">(3)</a>.  Gulhati observes that 'many investigators who conduct clinical trials are, or  have been, beneficiaries of largesse from the pharmaceutical manufacturers <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gulhati CM. Needed: closer scrutiny of clinical trials. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;12:4-5." id="4">(4)</a>.' Institutional members in the IEC may be junior to these researchers.  Since no overt conflict of interest is apparent to IECs, the indirect benefits  and mutual arrangements between companies and doctors often go unnoticed.  Institutions' need for resources may also put subtle pressure on IECs to approve  research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover,  the ICMR lacks the authority to take action against unethical IECs. There  exists no mechanism for accreditation of IECs and quality control of ethics  review is practically impossible. There is no comprehensive database on either  IECs or research participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					India  is also witnessing the birth of unaffiliated Ethics Committees to review  protocols for institutions with no IECs, supported by fees from the  pharmaceutical industry. In the West, there is an 'uneasy alliance' between such  bodies and the industry <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T. Uneasy alliance-clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry. N Engl J Med 2000;342:1539-44." id="5">(5)</a>. The problem is likely to be worse in India.

				<h4>The  Indian Council of Medical Research</h4>
				<p>
					The  ICMR has implemented several interventions in the past few decades to improve  the ethical review of research. In addition to developing general research  guidelines, it has started work on guidelines for specific areas of research.  It has constituted a 'Bioethics Cell' under senior staff trained in bioethics.  It hosts a website with links to leading bioethics journals <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Available from URL: http://www.icmr.nic.inbioethics.htm (accessed on May 6, 2004)." id="6">(6)</a>. It is  preparing standard operating procedures for IECs and standard formats for  ethics review across IECs. It has supported the formation of a forum for ethics  review committees in India, is working with similar bodies in the Asia-Pacific  region, and is putting together a database on IECs in the country. To enhance  ethics capacity, the ICMR identifies mid-career professionals to be trained in  bioethics through fellowships. It also conducts training sessions for  researchers, academicians, IEC members and students within India.

				<h4>Future  directions</h4>
				<p>
					Various initiatives are on to strengthen the capacity of bioethics in India,  with the help of the US National Institutes of Health and global bodies such as  the World Health Organization and UNESCO. However, current efforts may be  limited, given the number of research institutions and the volume of research.  The following suggestions may be considered:
				</p>
				<p>
					India  needs more professionals trained in bioethics. Bioethics training should figure  strongly in the medical curriculum, and researchers need to be trained in  research ethics. When professionals such as lawyers cannot be attracted to work  voluntarily for IECs, their time may need to be compensated for adequately. IEC  member secretaries must be compensated fairly for their additional work. A  portion of every research institute's budget should be earmarked for IECs.  Databases on IECs and trial participants will have to be created. State-level  IECs should be created to monitor IECs and review protocols of institutions  without IECs. Standards must be prepared and made available to all IECs. The  ICMR must be given more legal authority.
				</p>
				<p>
					Institutional  mechanisms for ethical reviewing of research involving human participants in  India are weak and vulnerable. A concerted effort is required to strengthen  them to fulfil their stated missions.
