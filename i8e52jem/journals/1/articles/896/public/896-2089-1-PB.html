				<h4>Consent for intimate  examinations</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty students are huddled around a patient trying to auscultate a cardiac  murmur. Others try to percuss the chest of a patient with emphysema, oblivious  of the patient's agony each time the plexor strikes the pleximeter. An elderly  gentleman complaining of difficulty in passing urine finds that all the  students in the department will perform rectal examinations to feel his  enlarged prostate, apparently unaware of the discomfort this could cause. The  primigravida in the pangs of labour finds she is subject to a succession of  students estimating the dilatation of the os in a per vaginal examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such memories came back to me when I read an article on the ethics of having  medical students learn through intimate physical examinations <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Coldicott Y, Pope C. The ethics of intimate examinations-teaching tomorrow's doctors. BMJ 2003;326: 97-101." id="1">(1)</a>. Students  responding to a questionnaire described how they had performed intimate  examinations, including on sedated patients, without consent; often, many  students examined the same patient. The report generated a heated debate on the  ethics of such examinations for teaching purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					How many medical colleges in India even have written policies and guidelines on  the subject? Once I asked a class of third-year medical students what they  understood of medical ethics. Eight out of 20 said they had never heard of the  term. What would their experiences be on learning how to conduct physical  examinations?
				</p>
				<p>
					This blase attitude is common in our outpatient departments. Students are  enthusiastic about developing their skills even as they ignore the patient's  perspective. Today, people challenge the notion that such practices can be  justified because of the need to train students. Patients cannot be used as  teaching aids without their consent. They must be treated with dignity.

				<h4>Sponsored conferences</h4>
				<p>
					In India drug companies are the major sponsors of local, state and national  medical conferences, paying speakers and their travel and accommodation costs,  as well as individual registration fees for certain doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					We approached a chemist's shop and obtained the prescriptions written over one  month by four physicians in this area. Three of the four, who are known to be  sponsored by a particular drug company on various tours, turned out to be major  prescribers of this company's products. The fourth physician, who prescribed  cheaper products, is not invited to such functions at all. Further, this doctor  has been ostracised by his own colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Few doctors raise their voices against sponsorship by drug companies.  Sponsorship is flourishing like a disease, particularly in cities. The industry  must have its wings clipped.

				<h4>Patients' rights</h4>
				<p>
					A recent visit to the United States included visits to dentists, general  medical practitioners, consultants and university hospitals. Three things  impressed me vis-&agrave;-vis the rights of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most doctors have displayed their consultation charges in the waiting room or  at the receptionist's desk. Second, all hospitals have information on patients'  rights displayed clearly in wards, waiting areas and lobbies. These rights  include the right to refuse treatment, to a second opinion and to privacy. It  is clear that patients are informed of their rights before treatment or  surgery. Third, HIV, HBsAg and HCV tests are not done on patients. It is felt  that if the patient's immune status should be declared, so should the  surgeon's, because either can infect the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am writing this particularly to highlight the controversy raised in India  over the display of medical fees, and on the compulsory testing for HIV status,  something that all of us do preoperatively.
