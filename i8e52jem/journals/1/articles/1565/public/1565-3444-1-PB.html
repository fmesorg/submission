				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					The changing  relationship between doctors and patients has undergone a sea change in the  last sixty years. The old family physician is fast disappearing, no longer  friend, philosopher and guide.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advancing technologies and umbrellas of chemotherapy and antibiotics  now override careful history taking and clinical examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the taint of lucre can tip the scales of ethical  restraint.
				</p>
				<p>
				Various arguments are raised. 'Is not the labourer worthy of his  hire?'; 'Doctors too, must live!'; 'The cost of medical education is so high,  and even a room to practice in costs a bomb.'; 'In all justice, is he not  entitled to a fair return?' <strong>These may be fair questions, but can never justify  unethical conduct.</strong> This is the first criterion that must pervade the medical profession  if it is to rise above the ethic of the market place. </p>
				<p>
					A patient, made aware by the media of these concerns weighing on  the medical profession, may question the essence of the fiduciary contract  between doctor and patient.
				</p>
				<p>
				When we add to this, the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act  (CPA), we are certainly at a crucial crossroad. If the CPA is empowered to  equate the professional services rendered by a doctor as goods, on the same  plane as a toaster supplied by a manufacturer, we lose sight of several  subjective factors that separate a professional service from <em>goods supplied.</em> </p>
				<p>
					In the latter case, objective criteria of claims made or  protections prescribed can clearly be spelled out and independently tested.  Obviously, to protect themselves doctors prescribe, or at least recommend that  certain objective tests be undertaken. While perfectly certain of his  diagnosis, the doctor feels he must order the test primarily as 'insurance  protection'. Naturally, this raises the cost to the patient.

				<h4>The doctor - patient  contract</h4>
				<p>
					When a patient comes to a doctor, whether he knows it or not, a contract comes  into effect. This contract is essentially between two parties who agree to  deliver on the one hand, and to receive on the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Between doctor and patient, this contract is essentially based on  faith. His consent can be inferred by his voluntarily coming to the doctor for  assistance; or in some cases made overt when he signs a declaration accepting  some mode of therapy, especially in declarations for admission to hospitals or  nursing homes. In public hospitals (and to a slightly different degree, in  private hospitals), the hospital is the 'delivering' party and its doctors are,  in a sense, its special agents. The honorary doctors are not paid agents and  bear a greater degree of independent responsibility.
				</p>

				<h4>Introducing a third  party</h4>
				<p>
					I have particularly  indicated 'two parties' with regard to this contract, because the question of a  referral immediately involves a third party or person into this contract.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem of the third person must be seen in the light of  individual rights and obligations, as well as professional responsibilities and  inferred ethical norms, codes and guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					A fundamental principle in medical ethics holds that the human  being has a unique value, status and dignity. In no professional transaction  must the obligation to uphold this right be violated.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the first consent can be inferred, in a referral, this  consent cannot be so easily inferred. The patient must be informed of the new  entrant into the contract with the reasons for the introduction of this third  party. In this circumstance the third 'person' or specialist is called because  the conditions of the case warrant the need for another supportive or  additionally required form of expertise. Thus it is the welfare of the patient  that is the only reason for this referral.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here lies the evil of 'cut back' or 'commission'. In trade or  business, a commission can be part and parcel of the mechanism of the contract,  where the prime purpose of commerce is profit. The ethic of business is  primarily the prevention of fraud, or exploitation and the gimmick of false  representation by skilfully worded advertising, where glamour is often a cover.  The ethical 'evil' here lies when skill is often deliberately used to carefully  skirt the law of misrepresentation or actual fraud.
				</p>
				<p>
					In business, another ethical difference is that of 'putting one  over' a serious competitor by skilful advertising which is forbidden in  professional ethics.
				</p>

				<h4>The question of responsibility</h4>
				<p>
					In the matter of medical referral, there is also another ethical consideration  with medico-legal significance.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is the question of primary responsibility. This depends on the  nature of the referral.
				</p>
				<p>
					If for instance, it is a consultation between general practitioner  and specialist, the latter is mainly responsible for the continued care and  concern for his patient. The general practitioner merely follows the advice of  the consultant, reporting to him the progress of the patient so as to modify  therapy or obtain further instructions with regard to continued care.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, if the referral is such as to need the  independent care by the consultant, the patient is transferred to the care of  the consultant. The general practitioner moves aside, though courtesy and  etiquette demand that the consultant keeps the referring doctor informed of the  progress of the patient. Once the immediate specialised care is completed, the  patient can then be returned to the general practitioner for such continued  care, advice etc., as may be necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, in both public and private hospital health care  systems, the patient decides for himself on which consultant specialist or  department, he should go to. The result is a waste of time, undue expense and  the unnecessary shuffling of a patient from one consultant to another. For  instance, a young woman decides that her pain is due to appendicitis and goes  to a surgeon. He decides that there is no disease in the appendix but suspects  need for gynaecological intervention. The patient is referred to the  gynaecologist. The general practitioner would have identified the need for a  gynaecologist and made the appropriate referral, at diminished expense and  certainly a saving of valuable time on the part of consultants as well as the  patient.The two tier system, which poses definite advantages, needs to be  resuscitated. Here all patients can be first seen by individuals or teams of  general practitioners, adequately qualified to treat and deal with the ordinary  run of ill health while at the same time equally qualified to know to which  consultant to go and order appropriate tests prior to the visit to the  consultant.
				</p>

				<h4>Referral of patients  admitted to hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					In-patient referrals,  both in public and private hospitals, are either for particular supportive  consultation or to effect a transfer to another appropriate speciality.  Generally, these consultations are facilitated between the various consultants  on the staff of the hospital. If a patient seeks another doctor not on the  staff, he has a perfect right to seek discharge from the hospital to be treated  by the doctor of his choice elsewhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respecting patient autonomy, in some private hospitals, there is a  provision whereby the hospital will permit the second consultant (not on the  staff of the hospital) being called at the request of the patient provided the  current treating doctor also agrees. If it is a mere consultation, the original  treating doctor bears full responsibility for continued treatment. In cases of  surgery where an outside consultant is actually involved in the surgery  jointly, it is only ethical that both doctors continue to bear joint  responsibility. Legally, this problem of joint responsibility is quite a vexed  question. However, the doctor in whose unit or under whose care the patient is  registered, cannot abdicate responsibility, unless it is a question where the  patient has been transferred to the care of another specialist who must accept this  independent responsibility. Here too, the patient's informed consent is an  ethical necessity.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Second opinion</h4>
				<p>
					In the matter of  referral, it sometimes happens that the patient will ask (rather hesitantly -  for fear of offence) that the treating doctor agree to a second opinion. No one  should see this as a lack of faith but rather respect a patient's right to  total autonomy and gladly give his consent, unless he honestly feels it would  not be in the best interest of his patient. In this latter case, he should  explain his reasons for non agreement, but clearly leave his patient free to  seek treatment from the other doctor. However, as the doctor too, has rights  and professional autonomy, he should make it clear that the discharge from his  care also involves discharge from future responsibility. Incidentally, this  discharge does not absolve the first treating doctor from proven incompetent or  negligent treatment while under his care. Thus, if the second surgeon were to  operate again and find that a swab had been left behind, the first operating  surgeon is ethically, morally and legally responsible.
				</p>
				<p>
					It frequently happens that a patient 'shops around' from doctor  often in the hope of getting an opinion that he/she to doctor, would find  either convenient or to preformed expectations. Or the patient seeks treatment  from one for a period of time, then leaves that doctor to go to another without  telling the second, either details or facts of previous treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors should understand that patients are human beings,  especially vulnerable under the burden of sickness. While the doctor is  certainly entitled to a true and full past history, failure on the part of the  patient to disclose an earlier consultation should not always be construed as  an inability to keep the faith so vital to the contract. Prudent questioning is  certainly the right of any doctor who is concerned to give of his best to his  patient, and part of good history taking.
				</p>

				<h4>Can a doctor refuse to treat a patient?</h4>
				<p>
					Being a professional in his own right, the doctor certainly has an ethical  right to refuse to treat a patient, who will, in his view, not follow treatment  directions to their logical ends.
				</p>
				<p>
					This right not to treat or accept for treatment also extends to  those situations where a patient approaches a doctor insisting on a  predetermined mode or line of treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					My only plea in this context is that the doctor is a man of  morality first. By morality, I mean that every man. be he theist,or atheist,  agnostic or 'secular humanist', has the right and obligation to choose between  what he sees as right and wrong. Every doctor is a professional, who by his  chosen vocation agrees to abide by a code of ethics guided by morality.  Finally, as social beings, both doctor and patient are guided and restricted by  the laws of the land in which they live. They may not agree with those laws.  For this they must seek legal redress to gets these laws changed.
