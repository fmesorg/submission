					The latest census figures have re-focused attention  on gender disparity in the population. Changes in the female sex ratio in the 0  to 6 year group are cited to substantiate the theory that female foeticide is  an added influence on an already skewed sex ratio. Though sex-selective  abortion is an undeniable fact of life in India, especially in its urban  population, what has not been analysed is how much this practice has added to  the gender disparity in the population.

					Data from a leading private hospital in Jaipur  provide some leads. Of the live births in this hospital, for every 1,000 males  there are about 830 females, <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Personal communication, Santokba Durlabhji Memorial Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan." id="1">(1)</a> indicating an excessive loss of female  foetuses in the antenatal period. Spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy,  still births and medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) are cited as the  various causes of foetal loss during pregnancy. Compared to 80 foetuses lost  per 1,000 live births due to natural causes, there were 65 foetuses lost by MTP  for every 1,000 live births in this hospital. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Personal communication, Santokba Durlabhji Memorial Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan." id="1">(1)</a> The ratio of spontaneous  abortion to live births will be higher in the general population with poorer  nutrition and access to care. Moreover, only spontaneous abortion cases that  develop complications are admitted to hospital.

					A one-year survey of the labour room register of  the two maternity wings of SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur, reported 724  still births and a total of 15,346 live births &mdash; a still birth rate of 50 for every 1,000 live births. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kabra SG. Medicine Deranged, Panchsheel Prakashan, Jaipur, 1998, pp.6-36." id="2">(2)</a> A two-year study of hospital records reported  791 stillbirths for 14,928 live births <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Babineau AJ. Preventing neural tube defects in Rajasthan, India: A paper prepared in partial fulfillment of the requirements of degree of Masters in Public Health (MPH) and submitted to the Faculty of the Department of Health Policy and Administration, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA, through The Indian Institute of Health Management Research, Japiur, India. 1998" id="3">(3)</a>, a stillbirth rate of 53 for  every 1,000 live births. The 1999 figures for Mahila Chikitsalaya reveal a  still birth rate of 69 for every 1,000 live births. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kabra SG, Gupta Rajeshwari and Paliwal Sunita.

				<p>
					The predominant known cause of spontaneous  abortions and still births is congenital anomalies, in which neural tube  defects are predominant. In the two studies mentioned above, 65 per cent <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kabra SG. Medicine Deranged, Panchsheel Prakashan, Jaipur, 1998, pp.6-36." id="2">(2)</a> and 74 per cent <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Babineau AJ. Preventing neural tube defects in Rajasthan, India: A paper prepared in partial fulfillment of the requirements of degree of Masters in Public Health (MPH) and submitted to the Faculty of the Department of Health Policy and Administration, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA, through The Indian Institute of Health Management Research, Japiur, India. 1998" id="3">(3)</a> respectively of children born with neural tube defects were  females; the female foetus is apparently more vulnerable and sensitive to  teratogenic environmental insults.
				</p>
				<p>
					Folic acid deficiency is a well known cause of  neural tube defects <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Research Council Vitamin Study Research Group. Prevention of neural tube defects: results of the Medical Research Council Vitamin Study. Lancet 1991; 338: 131-137." id="5">(5)</a> and a preventable cause of predominantly female foetal  loss. Folic acid must be available peri-conceptionally since the brain is  formed in the first six weeks of pregnancy. Other causes of prenatal foetal  loss must also be investigated and corrected.

				<h4>Female foeticide: a misnomer</h4>
				<p>
					It is a woman's fundamental right to terminate a pregnancy  by asking a doctor to induce an abortion under the Medical Termination of  Pregnancy Act. This right is recognised under Article 21 of the Constitution  (protection of life and personal liberty). The foetus' right to survive under  Article 21 is subservient to the mother's right and is available to the foetus  only in the later part of the pregnancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though called Medical Termination of Pregnancy,  this is a non-therapeutic, non-medical abortion. A woman approaches a  gynaecologist for termination of her pregnancy on the ground of contraceptive  failure. If she has got the foetus' sex determined by a sonologist, she does  not have to disclose the foetus' sex to the gynaecologist, who has no  discretion in this matter. This legal provision to terminate a pregnancy is  different from the provisions for therapeutic abortion under the Indian Penal  Code 312 - on medical grounds to save the mother's life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, over 80 per cent of abortions are performed  in the first trimester of pregnancy <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State-wise distribution of MTP cases by duration of pregnancy, 1996-97. Family Welfare Programme in India Year Book 1997-98. Department of Family Welfare, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government ofIndia. New Delhi. p. 137." id="6">(6)</a> when foetal sex cannot be determined by  ultrasonography. The right to abortion on demand is extended up to the 20th  week under the MTP Act, on certification of the pregnancy's duration, by two  doctors. Sonography &mdash; the currently prevalent and easily available mechanical method  of sex determination &mdash; can determine foetal sex only around the 15th week of  pregnancy. Restricting the right to abortion to the first 12 weeks of pregnancy  would automatically curtail sex-selective abortion. For rape-induced pregnancy  and congenital anomalies, therapeutic abortion is available under IPC 312.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultrasonography is a very powerful and essential  diagnostic method in medicine. Its use should not be restricted by the Prenatal  Diagnostic Technique (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act.
