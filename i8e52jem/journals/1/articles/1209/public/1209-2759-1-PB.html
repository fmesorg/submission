					Family practice is perhaps the oldest form of  modern medical practice. It also involves the largest number of medical  professionals. In India, where around 70 per cent of health care is now  delivered by the private sector, family physicians form the largest group of  health care providers coming into first contact with the patient. In that  sense, the scientific and ethical temper of this group of practitioners has a  major impact on health care. Any attempt to change prevalent norms of medical  practice should necessarily therefore grapple with the aspirations and concerns  of family physicians.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because of their close contact with the community,  family physicians also occupy a crucial position in preventive and social  aspects of health care, an important area for those who believe in a wider  definition of ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					My personal impressions of family practice began  very early in life as my mother has been a general practitioner for the last 40  years. I grew up in a setting in which most of our family friends were general  practitioners (GPs). As is often described about general practice of the past,  those were the times of family physicians who were simple and friendly, and who  offered their services at a low cost and in a low-key style, in small  clinics and without much of the marketing paraphernalia that now characterises  medical care. A large number of GPs served the working class both directly and  through the employees state insurance scheme and themselves led a  middle-class lifestyle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Decades later, as a specialist in Mumbai's private  sector, I now interact with GPs at a different level. However, my  impression of many GPs remains largely the same. In fact, as opposed to  specialist practice, family practice still relies the least on marketing  gimmicks and has the strongest doctor-patient bonds. GPs are the only  source of immediate medical care to the millions in Mumbai's slums. In fact,  because of their close bonds with the community, there are many examples of GPs  becoming politically active and even becoming elected representatives. For  example, trade unionist Datta Samant's interest in organising workers  originated from his close interaction with quarry workers who were his  patients. A few years ago, Dr Natu was elected as an MLA from Konkan in  Maharashtra, based on his popularity as a family physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some may perceive this rather 'simple' style of  family practice as resistance to change. In my opinion, this simplicity is  actually a strength. Such a patient-friendly and community- based form of  practice can be an effective counter to the excesses of privatisation and  market medicine that we are beginning to see with the emergence of hi-tech,  specialist care. However, does family practice today play this role?
				</p>

				<h4>Fee-splitting</h4>
				<p>
					From the accompanying articles, it is obvious that  there are many practices in contemporary medicine - perceived as examples  of 'commercialisation' - in which family physicians are willing participants,  along with the rest of the profession. There is no better example than  what has been variously termed 'fee splitting', 'commisions', 'cut practice' or  even 'referral fees'. It would not be an exaggeration to say that any  discussion on the ethics of medical practice today inevitably veers  towards this phenomenon. Although this practice involves many other  players, any discussion on contemporary ethical dilemmas in family practice  would be grossly incomplete without a look at this phenomenon.
				</p>
				<p>
					It must be stated at the outset that the practice  of giving commissions for referral of patients is not restricted to the  GP-specialist interaction. It is now commonplace for commissions to be given by  pathology laboratories, radiology establishments, equipment manufacturers and  perhaps even institutions. In fact, even specialists practice a  sophisticated form of commissions by referring patients to each other, often  more as a 'return referral' than because there as a genuine need. Also, it is  probably true that the idea of such commissions originated from aggressive specialists  trying to increase their practice through commercial incentives.
				</p>
				<p>
					One common justification of this practice is that  such commissions are accepted in other professions (more precisely, trades) and  in society in general; why should they be deemed wrong for the medical  profession? Also, since we have accepted a privatised healthcare system  in which healthcare providers decide how to charge patients for their services,  what objection could one have if two of the players decide to share the fee?
				</p>
				<p>
					These may be fair arguments in themselves, except  that they assume that socially accepted rules for all professions apply to the  medical profession as well. Historically, the medical profession has been given  special privileges by society with the understanding that it has special  responsibilities towards society. These include a commitment to provide  affordable, quality care.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not to say that there is evidence that  society objects to fee splitting. But then, has society been asked its opinion  in any form? It has been argued that society need not be asked, since  fee-splitting does not affect health care delivery. It is my contention,  however, that such practices contribute to increased costs, and also affect the  quality of care. When referrals are based mainly on commercial considerations,  the merit of the referral (and in turn the quality of care) will suffer. Also,  the battle for a share of the pie is reflected in an increased cost of care.  Those who offer commissions increase their charges to maintain their share of  the pie. Thus, this practice has definite implications for society.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case, as a profession (perhaps through our  professional organisations) it may become necessary to inform the public  of the practice of 'fee-splitting', and also rationalise and structure the  system. If we do not do this, the public may form its own impression as to the extent of this practice, and  its logic. This may add substantially to the profession's already diminishing  credibility.
				</p>

				<h4>Hierarchies</h4>
				<p>
					Another phenomenon relevant for our discussion,  which is articulated in some of the accompanying articles, is the presence of a  very strong established hierarchy in the medical profession. To an extent, this  is a reflection of the economic hierarchy in society itself. Thus you have a  pyramid with the urban super-specialist at the top, the rural family physician  at the bottom, and other healthcare workers - including nurses, health workers  and other staff - in between at various levels. This hierarchy is also  expressed in the relationship between practitioners of modern medicine and of  alternative systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					This hierarchy manifests itself in various forms,  starting from something as simple as dress and style codes. Three years ago,  when I became a 'consultant' in the private sector I was advised by many  well-meaning friends to start wearing a tie - advice I did not receive in all  my years as an associate professor in a medical college. For some time, I  was routinely stopped by the security guards at some hospitals, perhaps because  without the proper attire I did not fit into their image of a new  consultant. Interestingly, some family physicians of my parents' age now  call me 'sir', perhaps a reflection of the same hierarchy.
				</p>
				<p>
					On another level, this hierarchy has other  implications leads to discrimination and conflicts. Why should a new young  consultant just starting practice expect to earn - and actually earn - more  than a rural GP who has spent his entire life in practice? In this hierarchy,  it is also assumed that those with more glamorous skills are higher up and  therefore must earn more. I remember a cardiac surgeon once explaining that the  reason they charge more than other surgeons do is because their skills are more  'sophisticated'. This hierarchy often leaves individuals dissatisfied if they  cannot attain the economic 'status' of their peers, pushing them into  questionable practices which may not be in the interest of the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Family practice like other sections is, also a  victim of this hierarchy. The effort to project it as a specialisation could be  an attempt to counter this hierarchy. Also, GPs' demand for a share of  the patient's fees, which are currently heavily loaded in favour of specialists,  is also perhaps an assertion against this hierarchy. Add to this the pressure  on today's medical professionals to lead an upper middle-class lifestyle (with  all its trappings), and the ground for fee-splitting has been laid. Also, given  the scenario of a marketised healthcare system, which involves monetary  transactions at every step, the practice of referral fees gains a certain  natural acceptance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, those who feel morally indignant about the  'cut practice' could do well to understand that the roots of this and other  controversial practices lie in an increasingly privatised health care system,  which allows the market and the profession to arbitrarily determine how doctors  are going to charge their patients. It may be pertinent to point out that such  a system is perhaps unique to India. Even in the free market economies,  medicine and user charges have state controls Given this background, it is  unlikely that there are easy solutions to the ethical dilemmas posed by fee  splitting, and appeals to morality will certainly not get us anywhere.
				</p>

				<h4>Need for a debate</h4>
				<p>
					On the other hand, a beginning could certainly be  made on the premise that - whether we consider them wrong or right - we must  break the conspiracy of silence surrounding such practices. Medical associations  need to debate these practices internally. If the practice is deemed  acceptable, they need to come out with rational guidelines. If it is felt to be  undesirable, and the root causes of its wide prevalence can be identified, an  effort must be made to tackle these. For example, if the inequity in the fees  of specialists and family physicians is identified as one of the driving forces  behind fee splitting, an effort could be made to rationalise the fee structure.  This will not be easy, but it will certainly enhance the credibility of those  associations which attempt this exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Otherwise, as has happened in many other instances,  the state will step in at some stage, in response to public pressure.  Already there is evidence that the the state, the judiciary, consumer  groups and the public in general are becoming increasingly impatient with the  medical profession's inability to regulate itself and its fee structure. As a  result, laws covering all aspects of practice, including fees, are imminent.
				</p>
				<p>
					An alliance of individuals from all sections of the  profession including family practitioners, who believe in self regulation as a  social and ethical responsibility, can take the lead in starting this debate.  On their part, the ethics movement and people's health movements must provide  the platform.
