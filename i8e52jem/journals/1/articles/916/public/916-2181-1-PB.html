					We wish to comment on the report by Al Faisal and colleagues  													published in The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Al Faisal W, Sen K, Al Saleh Y. Syria: Public health achievements and the effect of sanctions. Indian J Med Ethics. 2012 Jul-Sep;9(3):151-3." id="1">(1)</a>. In that  													report, the authors claim that economic sanctions imposed  													in 2011 were the reason behind the devaluation of the local  													currency, interruption of power supply, scarcity of medical  													supplies, and degradation of sanitation systems. Nowhere to  													be found in the report, however, is a description, albeit brief,  													of what those sanctions are and how they led to these effects.  													No evidence of cause and effect was presented, no suggested  													mechanisms, and most grave, no consideration for the interplay  													between sanctions and an all-out civil war situation that  													interrupted every sphere of economic activity in the country <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rovera D, Amnesty International.

Such biased and unscientific analysis flies moreover in the  													face of known facts about the Syrian economy. The political  													and economic isolation of the Syrian regime is not new, but  													has allowed Syria, in the past, to ward off most of the global  													economic crisis of 2008, and will certainly make it more resilient  													to economic sanctions per se <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Haddad B.

What is most disturbing in a  													report about the wellbeing of Syrians in the current conflict  													still is the lack of any reference to the role of the Syrian regime  													in inflicting death and hardship on its population.

					Syria marks a unique case in modern history, where a war is  													waged by an armed-to-the-teeth regime against its own   people with 'all gloves off'. International treaties, norms, and moral  													constraints of conduct all cease to apply to how the Syrian  													regime is facing the uprising of people that is approaching   its  													two-year mark <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Editorial.

The wounded are followed to hospitals to be  													killed or kidnapped, the dead are mutilated and delivered to  													their families on the condition that they do not hold funerals,  													captives are tortured and summarily executed, and civilian areas  													are indiscriminately bombarded <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rovera D, Amnesty International.

Furthermore, a distinct  													hallmark of the Syrian regime's crackdown on the uprising has  													been the targeting of healthcare facilities and workers.
