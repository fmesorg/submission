					Through the courtesy of <strong>Dr. Helga Kuhse</strong>, Editor, we are receiving <em>Monash Bioethics Review</em> in exchange for our own journal. Dr. Kuhse is Australia's first research fellow in bioethics and serves The Centre for Human Bioethics at Monash University, Victoria as Director. She is also the joint editor of the British journal <em>Bioethics</em> and the author of several books on the subject, the most recent of which is <em>Willing to listen - wanting to die</em> (Melbourne: Penguin Books, 1994).

					Through the courtesy of <strong>Dr. Margaret Somerville</strong>, Gale Professor of Law, Director, McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law, Montreal, Canada, we have received several reprints and photocopies of key papers on medical ethics. They are particularly valuable as her Centre has just recovered from a disastrous fire that destroyed not only the premises but also most of its books, papers and manuscripts.

					Through the courtesy of <strong>Dr. George J. Agich</strong>, Professor of Medical Humanities and Psychiatry and Director, Medical Ethics Program, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, Illinois, we have received several reprints and details of curricular programs offered by this department. We especially call attention to the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Agich GJ, Youngner SJ: For experts only? Access to hospital ethics committees. <em>Hastings Center Report</em> September- October 1991; 17-25. (This essay asks important questions on the manner in which ethics committees function with special reference to whether patients and families should be permitted free access to them.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Kottow MH: When consent is unbearable - a case report. <em>Journal of Medical Ethics</em> 1978;4:78-80. (Under certain conditions, a doctor may be justified in withholding information from a patient and making a decision on his behalf without his consent. Dr. Kottow describes an example.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Kozak S, Nash R, Agich G et al: <em>Resuscitation of patients: one medical center's new approach.</em> Springfield, Illinois: Memorial Medical Center, 1990;41-61.
					</li>
					<li>
						Agich GJ: Rationing and professional autonomy. <em>Law, Medicine &amp; Health Care</em> 1990; 16:77-84. (Dr. Agich asks whether it is ethical for a doctor to ration medical care on the grounds of professional autonomy. He quotes as example Harvey Cushing's refusal during World War I to do more than two operations a day, despite the needs of so many other wounded, in order to ensure a high standard of care.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Agich GJ: Symposium on ethics and biomedical research. <em>Research in Philosophy &amp; Technology</em> 1980;3:39-75. (The symposium features the following papers:
					</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							Agich GJ: Biomedical research, policy and philosophy
						</li>
						<li>
							Benson RE: Technological innovation and health policy planning.
						</li>
						<li>
							Thomasma DC: Cultural issues in medical research.)
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						Frank S, Agich GJ: Nontherapeutic research on subjects unable to grant consent. <em>Clinical Research</em> 1985;33:459-464. (This essay was awarded the Nellie Westerman Prize for research in ethics. Principles discussed include i) research must in-volve no more than minimal risk to the patient, ii) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the patient, iii) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration and, iv) whenever appropriate, the patients will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Agich GJ: Medicine as business and profession. <em>Theoretical Medicine</em> 1990; 11:3 1 l-324. ('I have argued that medicine is a business. Doing so does not involve rejecting professional ethics but it does involve questioning the philosophical foundation and practical implications of claiming a special moral status for medicine.')
					</li>
					<li>
						Louis S, Agich GJ: Language and the physician's art. Changes in the meaning of the term 'physician'.<em>JAMA</em> 1979;242:2580-2582. ('Perhaps of most importance is the recognition by physicians... of the subtle erosion of the traditional understanding of the physician that occurs when agencies of government are permitted or even encouraged to impose concepts and definitions on practicing physi-cians...')
					</li>
					<li>
						Agich GJ: Justice and genetic engi-neering. In: Lamb D, Davies T, Roberts M (Eds.) <em>Explorations in medicine</em> Volume 1. Aldershot: Avebury, 1987;22-3.

Washington: Northeast Regional Medical Education Center 1979; l-128. (This is an excellent essay true to its title. Whilst it takes off from a geriatric platform, it will interest all physicians.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Agich GJ: The concept of responsibility in medicine. In: Agich GJ (Ed.) <em>Responsibility in health care</em>. Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel Publishing Company 1982;53-73
