					"While returning  from my morning walk, I saw a bird in a cage. It reminded me of people  imprisoned in prejudices. Prejudices are also cages, very subtle and self  created. First we create them, then becoming imprisoned in them, we lose all  capacity to fly in the open sky of truth. And just now I see a kite flying in  the sky. What freedom, what a liberation in its flights! One is a bird in a  cage, the other a bird in flight in the open sky, symbolic of two different  states of mind. Those who are liberated, fly in the sky of truth, but neither  are any footprints left behind, nor is any path created... there is path  towards truth, everybody has to create his own path to truth." <strong>&ndash; Osho</strong>

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					When the editor asked me  to write an essay on the subject of company sponsorships for medical  specialists, I realised that I had to pay a price to bell the cat. My immediate  provocation for a debate on this subject had come from a news item in <em>The  Times of India</em> of 7 May, 1997, <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain Kalpana: Doctors banned from attending sponsored foreign conferences. The Times of India 7 May, 1997" id="1">(1)</a> about a government order banning  doctors sponsored by medical companies from attending conferences abroad. It is  one matter to hold an opinion about a certain subject and a totally different  proposition to write a comprehensive essay on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I propose to deal with  the subject by highlighting the basic duties and privileges of physicians to  the professional organisations to which they belong and then take their  relationships with commercial establishments.
				</p>

				<h4>What are the goals and  objectives of professional bodies?</h4>
				<p>
					The objectives of any  scientific society or association are commonly based on the following  principles: <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Constitution : The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (est. 1964). Chicago: Elsevier, 1997 : 1-8." id="2">(2)</a>

				<ul>
					<li>
						to improve the quality and       practice of the discipline or the speciality;
					</li>
					<li>
						to promote and support basic       standards in the training programmes of the speciality;
					</li>
					<li>
						to encourage basic and clinical       research in the field;
					</li>
					<li>
						to promote the professional and       educational development of its members who have entered that field of specialty;
				  </li>
					<li>
						to provide a forum and       publication for scientific presentations and discussions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					There are minor  variations between the objectives of different associations and societies of  different disciplines depending upon the special needs of the specific  speciality.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>What are the ethical and  moral obligations of the members of professional organisations?</h4>
				<p>
					In order to remain in  good standing, all members must abide by the rules and regulations of the  society. Most societies have rigorous rules for enrolment of its members.  Amongst the rights and duties of its members, it shall be the duty of each  active member to attend regularly the meetings of the Society, to participate  in the scientific programmes, to uphold the ideals and objectives of the  society, and to pay the dues and assessments of the society.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly every  association or society has a number of committees to ensure that the goals and  objectives set by the founding members are achieved and the standards  maintained. In professionally mature associations and societies, amongst many  such committees are also the committee on Continuing Education and the  Committee on Standards and Ethics. These committees as well as the Medical  Councils are suitably empowered to take disciplinary action against erring  members.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>What is the need for  medical professionals to attend national and international conferences,  seminars and updates etc.?</h4>
				<p>
					Practising physicians  need to keep abreast of the rapid and continuous advances being made in their  respective specialities. Medical technology is changing at a very fast pace and  is contributing to major changes in the management of various ailments. In  fact, Continuing Medical Education (CME) is an important requirement for  doctors in order to keep up with changes in diagnostic and therapeutic  medicine. A certain number of hours of CME are mandatory for most physicians  practising in the USA and several updates, symposia and conferences have the  accreditation for certain hours for CME.
				</p>
				<p>
					As is evident from the  foregoing discussion, attending these meetings, updates, seminars and  conferences is not only the primary duty of the physicians laid down by their  association or society but also a mandatory requirement and a legal obligation  as per the prevalent laws of the particular state for license to practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from such  programmes and conferences, other avenues to keep up with the latest knowledge  are journals and other publications related to the subject. Many of these  publications are significantly supported by medical and pharmaceutical  companies. The current revolution in information technology (most advanced  societies are on the Internet), including satellite conferences, have enabled  physicians to access the latest happenings in their fields from the comfort of  their offices or homes. And yet, the charm and bonhomie of personal  interactions is possible only by attending conferences and updates. These are  also occasions for mixing pleasure with work for many physicians, otherwise  busy and overworked, as they attend these meetings with the spouse and family.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Who should fund these  conferences, updates and seminars?</h4>
				<p>
					Organising a conference  or an update has become a highly professional job. The big meetings and  conferences are held in five-star hotels or convention centres with excellent  facilities for lectures, audio-visuals and banquets. These conferences,  therefore, need big money to pay for all the facilities. Medical and  pharmaceutical companies give significant financial support in organising these  meetings and in turn have the privilege of participating in a trade exhibition  to promote their products to professionals in the field. Besides, all such  meetings have a registration fee paid by physician and non-physician members  attending these conferences. The registration fees have risen over the years  keeping up with the increased costs and inflation. Surely it should be possible  for the organisers to meet the expenses through money collected by the  registration fees. The actual scene is different as most lunches, dinners and social  events, becoming increasingly extravagant by the day, are fully sponsored by  various commercial organisations flush with money and eager to influence the  doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the commercial  aspects of holding the conferences are beyond the scope of this essay, I cannot  but refer to huge profits made by the organisers of the conferences. This  achievement of the organising committee is enviously applauded by the main  professional body who accept the share of the profits gratefully while the  organisers keep a handsome share, albeit for educational and research  activities. This in turn sets a standard for the organisers of the subsequent  conferences who once again depend heavily upon bigger support from commercial  organisations. And thus a vicious cycle has been set in motion with no one in  particular to blame. One may argue that it is not possible to hold such big  meetings without commercial support and yet some time back, a meeting of the  Indian Academy of Pediatrics was organised without accepting any commercial  support <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vox Populi: Conferences sponsored by drug companies. Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5: 93-94." id="4">(4)</a> and was by all accounts a successful one!
			  </p>
				<p>
					While one may argue in  favour or otherwise of commercial support for organising conferences, the issue  under discussion relates to individual doctors getting sponsored by these  companies. It should be difficult to defend such sponsorships for doing  something which should be their normal duty. As mentioned by Dean Ornish in his  best selling book, "Drug companies make millions of dollars educating  physicians. Drug companies are the major advertisers in all medical journals.  They fund clinical trials and pay the researchers to speak at hospitals and  medical schools... Drug companies provide sandwiches and doughnuts at hospital  conferences... They provide free samples... also sponsor scientific meetings .  . . sometimes held in resorts, and doctors who attend may even be given free  transportation and expenses. There is nothing wrong with any of this, and it is  all very comfortable and familiar. But a subtle and sometimes overt message to  doctors gets through that drug companies are friends." <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ornish Dean: Reversing heart disease. New York : Ballantine Books, 1996 : p 53." id="5">(5)</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					It is common for doctors  to get influenced thus.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Why do medical and  pharmaceutical companies support these meetings and/or physicians attending  these meetings?</h4>
				<p>
					Medical and  pharmaceutical companies are basically business enterprises making huge  profits. They have a substantial budget for promotion of their products which  they achieve by advertising in medical and non-medical media as well as by  sponsoring medical events as stated earlier. Some of the big companies have a  separate budget for educational and research activities which they use for  sponsoring clinical trials, updates, seminars and conferences. They are also  keen to sponsor willing doctors to attend these meetings and are ready to pay  airfare, five-star lodging and other perks. Spouses may be included at times!
				</p>
				<p>
					The argument that they  do so because of their genuine commitment to education and dedication to  research for the benefit of mankind should be taken with a generous pinch of  salt. After all, Enron is on record as having paid for the 'education of  politicians' though one may never know the nature and other details of such  education. To a common person it should mean, in plain words, an attempt to  gain favour, and that is what it is. It should also be understood that the cost  of all such education, research and other promotional activities is passed on  to the consumers -- in the present context, patients.
				</p>

				<p>
					From the foregoing, several points become clear. First, doctors belong to a  noble profession and their professional organisations have lofty goals and  objectives. Second, attending conferences and updates is absolutely essential  for doctors to keep up with the desired professional standards. Third, modern  medicine is controlled by high-tech sophistication, which is expensive and  therefore, generates fierce competition between companies and consequently,  generates marketing pulls and pressures. Fourth, doctors become unwitting  collaborators of these companies and are at a significant risk of getting  influenced while making treatment choices for their patients. Finally, the  increased costs are directly passed on to patients. In government and public  hospitals, this would mean that the administration has to spend large amounts  in getting high-tech equipment. It is not surprising that several such  purchases involve middle-men and fraudulent practices. It is not uncommon even  in public sector hospitals with limited resources to charge patients for  expensive investigations and procedures and in spite of that, find it difficult  to maintain such equipment. In private sector hospitals, once the technology is  procured at an exorbitant cost, there is increasing pressure on attending  doctors to refer patients in order to recover the cost of the equipment. This is  one explanation for the unnecessary investigations, procedures and even  operations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Doctors - a part of  society</h4>
				<p>
					The medical profession  is a part of society and suffers from the same maladies of erosion of values as  do the other segments of society. Is it fair to expect medical professionals  alone to hold moral and ethical values when many others have forgotten even the  definitions of these terms?
				</p>
				<p>
					I find it extremely  difficult to refute such arguments from my friends. At the same time there are  conflicts and blurring of views regarding legal, moral, social and ethical  values in any society. What may be socially sanctioned in one society or  culture may be taboo in another society. Similarly, a legal sanction may not be  moral or ethically correct and what is ethical may not have legal sanction.  Also there are likely to be as many individual variations about what should be  considered moral and ethical. However it is in order to say that general  ethical principles should have general acceptance and should determine what  ought to be done.
				</p>
				<p>
					The present erosion of  values seems to stem from the materialistic growth of society. Upwardly mobile  trends brought in by economic liberalisation have focused sharply on the haves  and have-nots. I find it paradoxical that reforms in the economic sector, long  perceived to be necessary and overdue, should be accompanied by such mayhem and  chaos in moral and ethical values. It is a reflection on the times that each  subsequent scam is bigger than the preceding one; so much so that the scandal  involving purchase of the Bofors guns appears to be woefully small and boring  in contrast to scams worth thousands of crores unearthed in recent times.  Desensitisation is complete. What is then wrong in doctors doing something  totally legitimate and innocent like enjoying the hospitality of rich companies  who after all cannot force them to use their products? In any case, the  companies are going to sponsor so many others attending the same conference and  an individual not accepting the generous .hospitality cannot make any  difference, or can s/he?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Depriving doctors  working in the public sector</h4>
				<p>
					The reason that a  government order was necessary to ban such practice itself means that something  was more than just wrong. I, however, have several problems in understanding  this order though I must admit that my impressions are based only on the  newspaper report and I have not been able to get a copy of the said order. Was  it legal, before the above order was brought in, for government doctors to  attend conferences sponsored by medical companies? Is it all right for doctors  to attend such conferences within the country as the order refers to  conferences organised abroad? If the government order is applicable only to  doctors working in government hospitals, would it imply that the law makers  thought it to be legal and moral for doctors in private hospitals to accept  such sponsorships? If at all one has to justify commercial support, it should  be for doctors working in government and other public sector institutions  rather than for super rich doctors in private practice charging illogically  high fees from their patients and who, in any case, can not only afford these  expensive conferences but also get attractive tax benefits!
				</p>
				<p>
					Several big private and  corporate hospitals usually sponsor their staff periodically to attend national  and international conferences. Conference funds at government and public  hospitals, on the other hand, have remained limited and unrealistically low. There  is no doubt in my mind that research funding and funds for continuing medical  education in teaching institutes must increase substantially to promote the  professional skills and standing of their staff.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Measures to prevent  corruption</h4>
				<p>
					Since there are real  risks in doctors accepting direct sponsorships from commercial companies,  several options need to be experimented with. These options should aim at  increasing the available funds of public institutions and at the same time  maintaining a healthy relationship between doctors and commercial  organisations. These arrangements should be such as to allay the present fears  of <em>quid pro quo</em> and also have legal, moral and ethical sanctions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a few suggestions  to make in this regard:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Public institutions and       hospitals, perennially starved of funds, should encourage generous support       from industrial houses, not necessarily those related to medical and       pharmaceutical interests. This support - specially when offered by the       latter - should have no strings attached, should be transparent and open       to public scrutiny. Doctors involved in research supported by medical and       pharmaceutical companies should be permitted to present/publish their       findings at national and international meetings and conferences with the support       of the sponsoring companies. There is no need for the institution to       sponsor such candidates. Instead, the sums saved can be used for other       deserving candidates. Most professional societies abroad demand a       declaration of any commercial interests and on the nature of relationship       between the physician presenting the work and the sponsoring commercial       company. Similar norms should be practised in Indian societies and       associations and members of these professional organisations should work       towards necessary amendments in their respective professional bodies.
					</li>
					<li>
						Medical and pharmaceutical       companies, normally so eager to sponsor individual doctors, should       contribute to the conference funds in public hospitals. These       institutions, in turn, should have a Conference Committee suitably       constituted to disburse the funds to different departments and individual       staff members, including nurses and technical staff members. The       Conference Committee should have unambiguous guidelines in order to ensure       fairness and transparency in its working. It will be desirable to have the       funding commitment from commercial companies for a block period (five       years or more), starting well in advance in the first financial year.       Selection of the staff as per guidelines must also be made well in       advance.
					</li>

					<li>
						Commercial companies may       continue to support conferences, seminars and updates and allowed to       promote their products ethically. The organisers of these conferences, in       turn, could reduce or waive registration fees, a benefit passed on to all       members without any favour or the risk of influencing individual members.
					</li>

					<li>
						Commercial organisations should       be encouraged to support activities directly related to patient care and       welfare specially in public sector hospitals. Contributions to patient       care and working conditions in public hospitals will not only give       satisfaction to the doctors and the poor patients they treat but will also       appeal to the conscience of donor companies.
					</li>

					<li>
						In the same vein as above,       doctors using expensive drugs, medical devices like heart valves,       pacemakers, catheters and expensive investigative tools should use their       influence with these companies to reduce their promotional budgets and       pass on the benefits to the end consumers, in this case, the patients.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Summing up</h4>
				<p>
					I have made a sincere  attempt to initiate discussion on what is currently wrong in the relationship  between physicians and commercial companies. I am aware of the limitations of  generalisations on a topic like this. I hope that this essay will be followed by  other useful and valuable contributions on this subject, both from the readers  of this journal as well as from others including commercial organisations. It  will be eminently rewarding for me if suitable guidelines emerge after a  thorough discussion on the subject. This, in turn, will encourage a healthy and  ethical relationship of mutual respect and dignity between the medical  profession and commercial organisations which are dependent upon each other for  meeting their commitment to the patients.
