				<h4>Can  risk information harm the patient?</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Can  prevention of harm pose ethical questions? The following article questions  rigid adherence to preventive medicine guidelines. More people in India now  expect their doctors to be knowledgeable about prevention measures. Thus, a  sceptical view should give us food for thought.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Extensive  implementation of preventive medical measures is becoming unmanageable as these  take up an extensive amount of consultation time. However, failure to follow  preventive guidelines is considered a sign of low-quality care. Doctors may not  have the time or ability to effectively communicate clinical risks. They may  also have doubts about interventions which are effective in optimal settings  but may be of marginal benefit in everyday practice. Health is affected by  external factors, such as social inequality and destructive human relations.  Finally, there is an ethical concern regarding the effect of preventive  medicine on individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information  about risk will increase people's sense of control and ultimately their quality  of life. However, risk information may create doubt and insecurity. Once such  information is passed on to a person it cannot be retracted. Respect for  autonomy should therefore also honour the person's right not to be  opportunistically confronted with knowledge about risks unrelated to the  reasons for seeing the doctor. While it is certainly good medical practice to  identify, emphasise, and support health-promoting resources, skills, and  activities, doctors should increase patient autonomy by inviting the patient to  introduce a topic rather than using a computerised prevention guideline.

				<h4>Resuscitation  of the terminally ill</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Increasingly,  patients with terminal illnesses are dying in hospitals rather than at home.  Therefore, it is important to be aware of the controversies discussed in the  articles below. Some of these are: How much should a physician share with the  patient and family? Who makes decisions: the patient or family? At present,  India does not have legally binding Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) or No Emergency  cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) directives but there is a growing need for  such a law.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Terminally  ill patients often have to make decisions about their final treatment after a  protracted period of illness. Discussion about CPR is as important as  discussion about any other treatment, and should be done early. Some doctors  avoid talking about DNR because they feel it is important to offer a positive  outlook. However, the alternative is that doctors use their judgement in making  this decision based on their assumption about the patient's quality of life and  this assumption may be inaccurate. A study of chemotherapy preferences among  patients with advanced lung cancer found that although all had received  chemotherapy, only a quarter would make the same decision again had they been  more fully informed. When patients become aware of the low probability of  success of CPR, many are less likely to request it.
				</p>
				<h5>Higginson  IJ. Doctors should not discuss resuscitation with terminally ill patients.  -AGAINST. BMJ 2003;327:615-16</h5>

				<p>
					Patients  increasingly want to participate in decisions about their treatment. Although  this is appropriate in most circumstances, discussing CPR with terminally ill  patients is not practical, sensible, or in the patient's best interests.  Patients need to maintain some hope-if not for a cure then at least for some  comfort. All comfort should not be lost as a result of the inappropriate  blanket application of a facile rule. This is particularly true when the rule  forces patients to make a choice, when in reality they have no choice. Another  argument for not discussing CPR with terminally ill patients is medical  futility. When people are dying, it is entirely ethical not to discuss  resuscitation with them.
				</p>
				<h5>Manisty  et al. Doctors should not discuss resuscitation with terminally ill  patients-FOR. BMJ 2003;327:614-15</h5>

				<p>
					The  authors wished to identify themes in the existing literature that could be used  to guide physicians in the discussion of CPR with hospitalised elderly patients  at risk of death. Most patients reported getting much of their knowledge about  CPR from television which portrays a high success rate for resuscitation.  However, patients' comprehension of most facets of CPR was poor. Willingness of  physicians to initiate discussions about CPR appeared to be the main factor  that determined whether such discussions occurred. The most common reasons  cited for not reviewing CPR preference were the patient not being ill enough,  the possibility of the discussion upsetting the patient, and the physician's  discomfort with the process. The majority of older inpatients preferred to be  involved in discussions about CPR. The authors suggest that physicians must  initiate these discussions with older patients, recognising that the  decision-making process may be complicated by cognitive impairment and  necessitate the presence of family members or substitute decision-makers.

				<h4>What  do patients want?</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Patients  often complain that doctors rarely spend adequate time talking to them. We need  a study like the one below to ascertain the wishes of our patients on how,  what, when and where our patients would like their doctors to communicate with  them.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors  searched the literature for articles with descriptions of patient participation  in treatment decisions. They concluded that patients want to be involved in  decision-making ('selecting the most desired bundle of outcomes') but leave the  problem-solving ('identifying the one right answer') to the doctor as it  requires clinical expertise. Most patients want doctors to understand their  preferences even if they do not wish to make the final decision. Enabling  patients to understand risks is crucial before considering different treatment  options. Yet, risk is a complex phenomenon that many patients (and doctors)  find difficult to understand and doctors must realise that some patients are  unable to cope with uncertainty. Patient preferences may be dictated by  alternative sources of information which may be resented by the doctor. Doctors  may have trouble eliciting patient preferences as these are influenced by the  way that they are elicited, and doctors may elicit preferences from certain  groups of patients more readily than others.

				<h4>When the doctor is also a writer</h4>
				<p>
					<em>IJME publishes and solicits articles on medical ethics from people involved in the medical profession. This article raises pertinent questions about the ethics of writing about patients.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Physician-writers have obligations to their patients and
					as writers to their readers. The first category, keeping
					faith with the patient, includes privacy, consent and
					consequences. The second category, keeping faith with
					the reader, includes the issue of fact or fiction, and
					transparency in disclosure. The authors cite examples to
					illustrate the dilemmas involved.

				<h4>Suicide  information on the Internet</h4>
				<p>
					<em>While  the Internet facilitates gathering information, the quality and content do not  always serve societal interests. The following article from India is a laudable  attempt to limit harmful content on the net.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Information  on the Internet promoting deliberate self-harm is a little discussed subject.  The author searched the net and found several websites that give detailed  information on how to commit suicide by a variety of means. He discusses the  ethical concerns of having this information available readily to vulnerable  populations. He describes the setting up of a database, E-Health Adversities  Research Database, that collects, analyses and publishes evidence regarding  adverse health information and practice over the Internet, to help formulate  future policy.&nbsp;

				<h4>Problems  in AIDS research</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Indian  scientists are preparing to launch Phase I of an indigenous AIDS vaccine.  Reports in the lay media and medical journals, while acknowledging the need for  multinational trials, warn about the exploitation of uninformed patients by  western pharmaceutical companies. The need of the hour is to ensure adequate  protection of the rights of trial participants so that an effective remedy  against AIDS is available in the near future.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					A  worldwide effort is needed to develop effective AIDS vaccines. The debate on  the ethics of conducting an AIDS vaccine trial raises difficult issues such as  adequate informed consent, and treatment for trial participants who become  infected by HIV during the trial. The author argues that requiring researchers  to provide lifetime care is a disincentive for such trials. Instead, by  adopting a developmental approach, participating communities would receive  priority in national and international programmes because they are contributing  knowledge that is a global public good.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h5>Berkeley  S. Thorny issues in the ethics of AIDS vaccine trials. Lancet 2003;362-992</h5>

				<p>
					International  trials raise ethical concerns because of great disparities in wealth, power,  and medical infrastructure and a history of exploitation. By inclination and  training, researchers may want to focus on the technical aspects of designing  protocols and analysing data. However, researchers conducting clinical trials  in developing countries have ethical obligations beyond those falling on  researchers working in the developed world. The authors describe ways in which  researchers can address these concerns.
				</p>
				<h5>Lo  B et al. Establishing ethical trials for treatment and prevention of AIDS in  developing countries. BMJ 2003;327:337-9.</h5>
				<p>
					<em>This  editorial discusses the World Medical Association's postponement of a proposed  amendment to the Declaration of Helsinki, concerning treatment provision after  a study ends. In particular, the amendment would be relevant in HIV vaccine  trials in the developing world, to ensure access to the 'best proven' therapy  identified in a study.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  writer states that opposition to the amendment is led by the US government and  western pharmaceutical companies who feel it unfairly burdens researchers and  their sponsors with responsibilities that should lie with the local healthcare  system. 'Paragraph 30', the proposed amendment, embodies a non-negotiable  principle preventing exploitative research in developing countries.

				<h4>Should  rich countries recruit doctors from poor countries?</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Physician migration agitates the lay public and medical  professionals. Is it ethical for doctors to migrate? Are migrating physicians  more ethical than their colleagues who accommodate to the less than ideal  setting in India? Reasons for migration are a complex mix of the personal and  professional. The following debate gives two views and additional opinions are  available in the issues of BMJ. The first author practises in the UK, while the  second is an official of the National Health Service (NHS), UK.</em>&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					The NHS  has launched a scheme to recruit specialists from developing countries for a  two year period. The writer notes that most doctors in developing countries are  trained in publicly funded medical schools. The cost of training is borne by  the poor country and the rich country reaps the benefits. What is needed is an  acknowledgement that institutions in developed countries have an ethical  obligation to facilitate the return of health professionals to developing  countries. Also, doctors going to work overseas must search for ways to share  their expertise and resources. At the same time, institutions in developing  countries must acknowledge that doctors leave not only for monetary gain but  also to escape stifling hierarchies.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h5>Patel  V. Recruiting doctors from poor countries: the great brain robbery? BMJ  2003;327:926-8</h5>
				<p>
					The  writer states that the international fellowships were launched in February 2002  to give experienced consultants the opportunity to work in the NHS for two  years. The National Health Service does not recruit from a country if its  government has any concerns about the effect on its workforce. It worked  closely with the Indian Ministry of Health in the development of the campaign  in India, and is working with India and other developing countries to support  them in developing programmes, including offers of fixed term placements in the  NHS as part of career planning to retain their staff.

				<h4>The  industry targets women</h4>
				<p>
					<em>On the  one hand women have been excluded from research and the results of studies done  on men are applied to women as well. On the other, the drug industry has  targeted women as a special 'market'. This editorial reviews direct-to-consumer  promotion of drugs, noting that many of these are targeted at women.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					A  review of magazine advertising found that whenever there is sex-specific  targeting, women are 2.6 times more likely to be targeted than men are. Normal  life stages such as the menopause are medicalised-what is described as the  'diseasing of risk factors'-fear is generated about fractures and heart  disease, and the drugs are promoted as life-saving as well as rejuvenating.  Women are also more likely to be prescribed psychotropic drugs when the diagnosis  did not warrant it-and when these drugs had not been tested on women in the  first place. The writer concludes that the campaign against irrational drug  promotion must also address its social and health effects, affecting women  differently from men.

				<h4>Doctors  and drug companies</h4>
				<p>
					This  narrative describing an encounter between a senior medical professor and a  former student who now heads a contract research organisation (CRO) highlights  the uncomfortable links between the medical profession and the drug industry in  India. Set in the backdrop of a medical conference-jamboree where, apparently,  doctors do everything but learn about medicine. The conversation illustrates  the various things CROs do to sponsor drug research done by doctors. In  exchange doctors get 'auxiliary support' and more. As the CRO's MD is quoted:  'You old-fashioned people will be surprised to learn what doctors are willing  to do for paltry sums.' Her parting lines: 'Look at this conference 'APICON'  you doctors have organised. You decide to have a banquet in a five-star hotel  and you demand money from multinational PIs.' The writer is left speechless: 'I  kept searching for words to defend my community of doctors against her  community of business interest.'
