				<h4>University of Oxford</h4>
				<p>
					I was most interested to hear of your work and congratulate you on an informative and well presented journal.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am sending you under separate cover a variety of materials which I hope will be of value to you:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						A selection of reprints on ethical and conceptual issues in meditine and psychiatry.
					</li>
					<li>
						A copy of my book Moral Theory and Medical Practice. As you will see this is concerned with the value structure of medicine and psychiatry looked at through the kind of work that has been done by analytical philosophers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some information about a programme in medical ethics, law and communication skills (practice skills) that we have set up for the medical students at Oxford. We are producing a Manual of the Practice Skills Course and I have put you on the list of people to receive a copy...
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<em>... I am also enclosing information about an International Conference on Philosophy and Mental Health. If you or any of your colleagues are interested in attending this, do let me know. We are particularly keen to build up an international movement concerned with the philosophy and ethics of psychiatry. This has been a rather neglected field but is actively expanding at the present time...</em>
