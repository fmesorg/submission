			<h2>CORRUPTION IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE</h2>
			<h3>Indian Council of Medical Research: then and now</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Sunil K Pandya</h4>
			<hr />

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						'O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!'
					</p>

					<p align="right">
						<em>&mdash;The tragedy of Julius Caesar</em>,

					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Successor to the Indian Research Fund Association (IRFA), the
					Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had Dr CG Pandit as
					its first director. He set high standards of probity and economy
					and was scrupulous in all his activities. He ensured ethical
					conduct in all activities of the council.
				</p>

				<p>
					The contrast between the reputation of the council in its early
					days and that today is striking. I have chosen two heads of the
					council&mdash;Dr CG Pandit and Dr NK Ganguly&mdash;and have used
					illustrative examples from their tenures. I have also used an
					example from 1996, before Dr Ganguly was appointed directorgeneral,
					to highlight the impotence of the council today when
					faced with a catastrophic breach of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					A noticeable decline from Dr Pandit's standards was noted over
					the decades following his departure and reached a nadir when
					Dr NK Ganguly publicly praised Dr P Venugopal for his use of
					stem cells in the treatment of cardiac disease <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Staff Reporter. ICMR okays stem cell research by AIIMS. The Hindu [Internet]. 2005 Apr 6 [cited 2013 Jun 1]. Available from: http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/06/stories/2005040612771300.htm" id="1">(1)</a>. The recent
					scandal in which Dr Ganguly has been implicated <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumar S. Indian medical officials charged in land deal case. Nature / News 8. 2013 March [cited 2013 Jun 1]. Available from: http://www.nature.com/news/indian-medical-officials-charged-in-land-deal-case-1.12554" id="2">(2)</a> adds
					nothing to his stature or that of the council.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Spartan values</h4>

				<p>
					Dr CG Pandit remains the gold standard against whom all
					succeeding heads of the council must be measured. His life
					and work have been recorded in his own words <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandit CG. My world of preventive medicine. New Delhi: Indian Council of Medical Research; 1982:363." id="3">(3)</a>. I strongly
					recommend this work to all those having the best interests of
					medical research in India at heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandit has described in this book the foundation and
					functions of IRFA and his appointment to IRFA as secretary in
					1948 by Dr Jivraj Mehta. When IRFA was replaced by ICMR in
					1950, Dr Pandit was appointed as its first director.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me provide some examples of his philosophy concerning
					the council.
				</p>
				<p>
					A head clerk at the council told me in the 1970s that he had
					been with the ICMR since its beginning: "I remember the day
					when Dr Pandit moved into his room. It was spartan in its
					simplicity. It had a cupboard for his files and books, a table and
					two simple chairs&mdash;one for himself and the other for a visitor. A
					fan whirred overhead during the summer. . . Now there is wallto-
					wall carpeting, air-conditioning, fancy lighting, a number of
					telephones, an array of other machines and an annexe where
					the personal assistant awaits summons from the directorgeneral."
				</p>
				<p>
					As an afterthought, he added: "And there are fancy flowerpots
					and other decorations."
				</p>
				<p>
					The clerk also narrated a conversation with Dr Pandit's driver.
					"As director he was entitled to the use of an Ambassador car.
					On one occasion he had to attend a meeting with the minister
					and his secretary in the afternoon. As it progressed he realised
					that the meeting would go on beyond 5 pm. Excusing himself
					briefly from the meeting, he came to the driver and told him
					to return to the ICMR, as he would be delayed. 'What will you
					do about returning home?' asked the driver. 'Oh, I will manage.
					I cannot keep you and the car waiting beyond office hours,' he
					replied as he returned to the meeting."
				</p>
				<p>
					On page 332 of Dr Pandit's book we learn that while he was at
					the helm, the yearly expenditure on the headquarters office
					of the council always remained around 7% of the total grant
					received by the council. About 4% of the grant was spent on
					laboratory animals, scientific reports, publications, library and
					stores, and other such activities; 89% of funds were spent on
					research and development activities including grants, pay and
					running expenses of scientific workers.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Critical self-analysis</h4>
				<p>
					When Dr Pandit neared the end of his stint at the ICMR, Dr S
					Sriramachari, additional director-general, suggested that
					he analyse the activities of the council from 1948 to 1965. Dr Pandit in turn asked him to do the study impartially,
					documenting failures and achievements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandit was quick to point out that this was not the first
					time that such an assessment was made. "No organisation can
					continue to function effectively unless a periodic assessment is
					made of its working," he wrote <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandit CG. My world of preventive medicine. New Delhi: Indian Council of Medical Research; 1982:363." id="3">(3:p 331-2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report by Dr Sriramachari, a document of over 150 pages,
					was produced and presented to the governing body. Dr Pandit
					joked that it was his last will and testament as far as the ICMR
					was concerned. It is difficult to recall a parallel situation in
					India, when a retiring chief, on the eve of his laying down
					office, placed an impartially drawn up balance sheet of the
					organisation on the table.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Need for another 'Sriramachari Report'</h4>

				<p>
					We await a similar analytical report as the council has
					completed 100 years. This is especially important as the budget
					allocated for the ICMR during the 12th Five-Year Plan is Rs 8,500
					crore <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Katoch VM. XII plan document (2012-2017) [Internet].

				</p>
				<p>
					This report should also embody a cost-benefit analysis of
					the council, its several institutes scattered throughout the
					country and the research projects carried out from Delhi and
					at each of the institutes. The analysis of the council and of each
					of its institutes could be along the lines of the report by Dr
					Sriramachari referred to above.

					In 2011, the IRFA/ICMR published a compendium of papers to
					celebrate its centenary <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Katoch VM, Srivastava VK, Srivastava D.

				<h4>The ICMR today</h4>
				<h5>Naming the ICMR building</h5>

				<p>
					In 2002, when it was decided to name the building designed
					and set up by Dr Pandit, he was ignored in favour of Dr
					Ramalingaswami. While the latter scientist's claim to fame
					cannot be disputed, it is difficult to accept that his contributions
					to the development of the ICMR were greater than those
					of Dr Pandit. Dr NK Ganguly, director-general of ICMR, who
					should have known better, was a prominent participant in the
					dedication ceremony of this "historic event" <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous. Dr CP Thakur dedicates ICMR building to professor V Ramalingaswami. 2002. [cited 2013 Jun 1]. Available from: http://icmr. nic.in/press.htm http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/17c.pdf " id="6">(6)</a>.
				</p>
				<h5>No action against unethical research</h5>
				<p>
					The ICMR's responsibilities include ensuring that research in
					this country is conducted ethically, and "the Central Ethical
					Committee of ICMR on Human Research constituted under the
					Chairmanship of Hon'ble Justice (Retired) MN Venkatachaliah
					held its first meeting on September 10, 1996. Several
					subcommittees have been constituted to address specific
					topics, viz., epidemiological research; clinical evaluation of
					products to be used on humans; organ transplantation; human
					genetics, etc." <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous. History of ICMR. Undated [cited 2013 Jun 2]. Available from: http://www.icmr.nic.in/history.htm " id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In December 1997, Dhani Ram Baruah transplanted a pig's heart
					into Purna Saikia, an Assamese farmer <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous. Vox populi: the first Indian porcine xenotransplant. Issues Med Ethics. 1997 Apr-Jun;5(2):62. Available from: http://www. issuesinmedicalethics.org/052mi062.html " id="8">(8)</a>, without preclinical
					studies, and without developing a means to overcome the
					certain rejection of the xenotransplant. Predictably, Saikia died
					soon after the operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have failed to find a scientific paper published by Baruah on
					this operation, the studies that went into its planning and its
					sequel.
				</p>

				<p>
					As late as February 2012, an editorial by Manji et al in the <em>Indian
					Journal of Medical Research,</em> published by ICMR, noted that even
					the limited use of heart valves of porcine origin, preserved in
					glutaraldehyde, should ideally be from "genetically-engineered"
					pigs <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manji RA, Menkis AH, Ekser B, Cooper DKC. The future of bioprosthetic heart valves. Indian J Med Res. 2012;135:150-1." id="9">(9)</a>. It is unlikely that any thought in this direction troubled
					Baruah six years earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have also been unable to lay my hands on any document
					published by the ICMR describing an inquiry undertaken by it
					into Baruah's unethical and fatal operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Far from being punished after due process of law, Baruah
					appears to be flourishing going by his several claims on his
					website, including the use of pig blood transfusions into
					humans and the "first successful clinical transplantation using
					pig as donor" <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baruah DR. Dr Dhani Ram Baruah. Inventions [Internet]. Assam: 2010[cited 2013 Jun 12]. Available from:http://drdhanirambaruahnewinventionsinhumangenetics.com" id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					ICMR and other national bodies created to further medical and
					scientific research appear to be indifferent to the operation
					in 1996 and the many other activities proudly referred to on
					Baruah's website.
				</p>

				<h5>Dr NK Ganguly</h5>
				<p>
					Graduating in medicine from Calcutta, he obtained his MD
					in microbiology from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical
					Education and Research, Chandigarh. He served as directorgeneral
					ICMR from 1998 to 2007.
				</p>
				<p>
					As with my account on Dr Pandit, I include some incidents
					which have struck me as important. The first dates to his term
					in the ICMR.
				</p>

				<h5>The use of stem cells in cardiology at AIIMS</h5>
				<p>
					The ICMR has as its mandate the promotion of medical research
					of the highest standards throughout the country. To ensure
					this it must maintain an unfailing vigil for unethical practices
					anywhere and nip them in the bud, disciplining those guilty of
					such practices. Like charity, such vigil must begin at home and
					its environs. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a
					nationally reputed undergraduate and postgraduate institute,
					is the next-door neighbour of ICMR. The many links between
					ICMR and AIIMS should make it easy for ICMR to detect and
					correct unethical practices at the AIIMS.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2005, Dr P Venugopal, professor of cardiac surgery, AIIMS,
					and his colleagues published two papers on the injection of
					autologous stem cells into the coronary arteries in patients with
					cardiomyopathy and in those with ischemic heart disease <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Airan B, Bisoi AK, Mohanty S, Narang R, Patel CB, Bhargava B, Venugopal P. Cellular cardiomyoplasty-a clinical study. Indian J Med Paed Oncol. 2005;26 Suppl:1." id="11">(11</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Seth S, Narang R, Bhargav B, Kothari SS, Venugopal P, Reddy KS, Kumar L, Mohanty S, Ray R, Naik N, Yadav R, Sharma S, Gulati G, Bisoi A, Airan B. Role of intra coronary injection of autologous mononuclear bone marrow stem cells in patients with chronic left ventricular dysfunction due to dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease with open coronary arteries. Indian J Med Paed Oncol. 2005; 26 Suppl.:2." id="12">12</a>). Each paper occupied just one page and concluded that the
					pilot study indicated the safety of the use of bone marrow cells
					and showed clinical and echocardiographic improvements. It
					did not refer to any experimental studies on the use of stem
					cells in cardiac disease by this group or preclinical trials. We
					are not informed whether informed consent was obtained
					from these patients especially since we have no references to
					similar use of stem cells anywhere in medical journals and since
					marrow was obtained from iliac crests, coronary angiography
					and endomyocardial biopsies were carried out. There is no note to show that the research projects were approved by the
					ethics committee of the institute. There are no details that can
					help the reader to judge whether there was any significant
					improvement. We are expected to take statements made in the
					paper at face value.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other authors from AIIMS proposed the use of stem cells as
					a therapeutic modality in the treatment of motor neurone
					disease and other neurodegenerative diseases <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh S. Stem cells as a therapeutic modality for motor neuron disease. Indian J Med Paed Oncol. 2005;26 Suppl.:20." id="13">(13)</a> and in static encephalopathy including cerebral palsy <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Srivastava MVP. Stem cell therapy in static encephalopathy including cerebral palsy. Indian J Med Paed Oncol. 2005;26 Suppl:16." id="14">(14)</a> in the same
					supplement of the journal. In all cases there are no references to similar usage elsewhere in the world or of their own
					experimental studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the same year, Devendra Gupta and Shilpa Sharma of AIIMS
					published a review paper <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupta DK, Sharma S. Stem cell therapy-hope and scope in pediatric surgery. J Indian Assoc Pediatr Surg. 2005;10(3):138-141." id="15">(15)</a>. I quote a paragraph from their
					paper:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New
						Delhi has taken the global lead in using the autologous
						stem cells obtained from bone marrow (sternum, tibia)
						and using them for various disorders (cardiomyopathies,
						diabetes, bony disorders, biliary atresia and choledochal
						cyst (cirrhotic livers), spina bifida, cerebral palsy and
						muscular dystrophy). This has been possible following an
						extensive background research that has gone for more
						than 2 years before using the stem cells on the human
						beings. At AIIMS, stem cells have been used in more than
						150 patients, including neonates and infants for various
						disorders.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					While this paper does refer to ethical issues, these pertain
					to the storage of umbilical cord/blood and not to informed
					consent or sanction by the institute's ethics committee. We are
					provided no references to the <em>"extensive background research
					that has gone for more than 2 years before using the stem cells on
					the human beings"</em> although they list 31 other references.
				</p>
				<p>
					My own search for references to the experimental work
					on stem cell work at the AIIMS leading to these papers has
					proved unrewarding. If, indeed, there be no preclinical study,
					phase I and phase II studies on the effects of the introduction
					of stem cells into human beings to cure disease, the scientific
					foundation of the claims made by Venugopal and others at the
					AIIMS lack validity and the experiments are patently unethical.
				</p>
				<p>
					A study of pronouncements made by Venugopal to the press, in
					2005, lead to greater consternation. A news item <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous. AIIMS claims cutting edge stem cell study. The Times of India [Internet]. 2005 Mar 23[cited 2013 Jun 12]. Available from: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/AIIMS-claims-cuttingedge-stem-cell-study/articleshow/1059744.cms?" id="16">(16)</a> claimed:
					"All India Institute of Medical Sciences is on the threshold of a
					medical breakthrough. The country's premier medical institute
					is preparing proof of efficacy of its stem cell therapy for the
					global medical fraternity. The institute has conducted tests on
					33 heart patients over the last 18 months using the therapy and
					'all of them are showing positive results,' says Dr P Venugopal,
					director, AIIMS."
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite my efforts, I have been unable to secure a copy of the
					document offering ethics clearance for these tests. I have also
					failed to obtain papers detailing the techniques used in the
					treatment or objective assessments of the patients used in these trials by impartial experts before and after treatment. If
					one takes the news item at its face value, the AIIMS team was
					"preparing proof of efficacy of its stem cell therapy". If this
					was true, would it not have been proper to await scientific
					publication of the claims in a reputed, indexed medical journal
					after peer review before making the news public? It would be
					of interest to learn how many more stem cell transplants have
					been carried out at AIIMS from 2005 to date on the basis of
					claims and suggestions made in the papers published in 2005
					and the improvements that followed in these patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					As regards the statement that "no ethical issues are involved in
					the stem cell research using adult cells," there are considerable
					grounds for disagreement. Sharma <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma A. Stem cell research in India: emerging scenario and policy concerns. Asian Biotech Dev Review. 2006;8(3):43-53." id="17">(17)</a> has pointed out:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>A lot more basic information about stem cells and
						their behaviour are [sic] required before they can be
						used for treatment. Extensive basic research is required
						for standardization of methods for the isolation of
						embryonic and adult stem cells from various sources.
						Future prospects for embryonic stem cell research include
						the following: generation of therapeutic grade cell lines;
						identification of human embryonic stem cells (hESC)
						growth factors; controlled differentiation, i.e. generation
						of specific cell population; study of fundamental changes
						in cell cycle control that occurs during embryonic
						stem cells differentiation; maintenance of stem cell in
						undifferentiated stage; regulation of differentiation of ESC;
						pleuripotency and differentiation of established cell lines;
						standardization of animal free defined culture conditions;
						developmental potential of human versus mouse ESC;
						standardization in use of specific stem cells to specific
						organ systems, etc. In addition, ESC could also be used for
						toxicology tests and may be valuable tools for traditional
						drug discovery...</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Venugopal and his colleagues should have complied with the
					need for such studies before embarking on their clinical usages.
					I have failed to find evidence that they did.
				</p>
				<p>
					I presume Dr Ganguly was privy to data not available to the rest
					of us for on April 5, 2005, <em>The Hindu</em> reported: "ICMR okays stem
					cell research by AIIMS" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Staff Reporter. ICMR okays stem cell research by AIIMS. The Hindu [Internet]. 2005 Apr 6 [cited 2013 Jun 1]. Available from: http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/06/stories/2005040612771300.htm" id="1">(1)</a>. The opening sentence of the report
					said: "Giving a thumbs-up sign to stem cell research work at
					the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the directorgeneral
					of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr NK
					Ganguly, today said he stood by the 'authenticity of the work
					by the Institute.' Dr Ganguly continued: "We have no plan to
					legislate the guidelines that are in place for carrying out stem
					cell research."
				</p>
				<p>
					This rapid assessment by the head of ICMR of work that was
					just being reported is surprising, to say the least. One would
					have expected a careful study of the preclinical work, phase I
					and phase II clinical trials and observation of the results of
					treatment over years to identify ill-effects and confirmation of
					clinical improvement by impartial observers before making any
					comments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Equally puzzling was the statement by Dr Vasantha
					Muthuswamy, deputy director-general, ICMR, and in charge
					of developing ethical guidelines for stem cell research and
					treatment: "We are only a block away from AIIMS and we did
					not know this (stem cell work) was happening there. If the
					nation's premier medical institute did not ask our permission
					for such therapy, how can we blame private clinics for what
					they do?" <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jayaraman KS. Indian regulations fail to monitor growing stem-cell use in clinics. Nature. 2005;434:259." id="18">(18)</a> Was the enthusiasm of Dr Ganguly for the claims
					of AIIMS based on non-scientific reasons?
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also struck by the fact that despite the "research" in India,
					experts abroad are proceeding cautiously. Martin-Rendon
					and colleagues <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Martin-Rendon E, Brunskill SJ, Hyde CJ, Stanworth SJ, Mathur A, Wall SM. Autologous bone marrow stem cells to treat acute myocardial infarction: a systematic review. Eur Heart J. 2008;29;1807-18" id="19">(19)</a> concluded their systematic review of
					randomised controlled trials in the use of stem cells in acute
					myocardial infarction (AMI) thus: "Stem cell treatment for
					AMI still holds promise. Clinically, these data suggest that
					improvement over conventional therapy can be achieved.
					Further, adequately powered trials using optimal dosing, longer
					term outcome assessments, more reliable, and more patientcentred
					outcomes are required." Note that they recommend
					further, adequately powered trials and not unrestricted usage.
				</p>

				<h4>Dr Ganguly and others implicated in ICMR land scandal</h4>

				<blockquote>
					<p>The arrests of several high-profile current and former
						officials of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
						on corruption charges have sent shockwaves through the
						Indian medical establishment.
					</p>
					<p>The government-funded ICMR, headquartered in New
						Delhi, coordinates and promotes biomedical research in
						India and runs 28 research institutes across the country.</p>
					<p>Those arrested by the Special Fast Track Court of the
						Central Bureau of Investigation include Bela Shah, head of the ICMR's division of non-communicable diseases; Ashok
						Kumar Srivastava, its executive engineer; and Bhawani
						Thyagarajan, a retired joint secretary in the Ministry of
						Health, among several others. Following their arrests, Shah
						and Srivastava have been suspended by the ICMR while
						the investigation takes place.</p>
					<p>The case follows a comprehensive investigation run by
						the government’s audit body, the Comptroller and Auditor
						General of India, which found that land procurement
						and irregular transfer for proposed building works by the
						ICMR between 2002 and 2008 were subject to large-scale
						irregularities, wasteful expenditure, cost overruns and
						inadequate oversight…</p>
					<p>Specific to recent arrests, the auditor found that land
						owned by the ICMR-affiliated Institute of Cytology and
						Preventive Oncology (ICPO) was illegally transferred to a
						private housing society of employees by the ICMR executive
						council at a fraction of its market price, causing massive
						losses to the government exchequer...</p>
					<p>Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, a former director-general of the
						ICMR and a leading Indian scientist, is also accused of
						the charges. He has an arrest warrant against him but
						has so far not presented himself in court. Ganguly is
						also chairman of the governing body of the Jawaharlal
						Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research
						in Puducherry, and heads a medical ethics committee for
						the Medical Council of India... <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumar S. Indian medical officials charged in land deal case.

					<p>
						The final 11 words emphasise the tragic state of affairs in Indian
						medicine.
