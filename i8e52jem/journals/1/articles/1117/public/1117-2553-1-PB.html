				<h4>Science, belief, and ethical practice</h4>
				<p>
					Medical practice based  on evidence is said to be the most ethical. But doctors may have to deal with  the opposing demands of conviction in unproven but widely used techniques. The  pulmonary artery catheter is "the mainstay of haemodynamic monitoring and  management of critically ill patients", but there is evidence suggesting  it is of questionable benefit, even harmful. Now, a trial of this catheter on  6,000 patients will involve the intensive care community as a whole, with ICUs  all over the UK. In such a situation, there will be doctors whose patients are  randomised not to receive a pulmonary artery catheter, but who believe that the  catheter would be a better option. They must continually remind themselves that  their beliefs are not supported by strong scientific evidence. The writer  describes this as "the perfect example of commitment to greater scrutiny  and optimisation of practice that we must all engage in, across all fields of  medicine".

				<h4>The larger picture</h4>
				<p>
					"Every element of a  research ethics review-the balance of risks and benefits, the assurance of  rights for individual participants, and the fair selection of research  populations-can be affected by the political and human rights background in  which a study is done." However, this context is not routinely considered  in the ethics review process. The authors provide suggestions on how such a  perspective will help review boards in the decision-making process.

				<h4>New research guidelines</h4>
				<p>
					The American Institute  of Medicine has issued new guidelines for protecting human research subjects.  It calls for improving informed consent practices. The IOM report is available  at <a href="http://www.iom.edu/" target="_blank">http://www.iom.edu</a>.

				<h4>Support the freedom to publish</h4>
				<p>
					The authors describe a  dispute between a researcher and the manufacturer of a drug. When the  researcher insisted on publishing her data considered adverse by the  manufacturer, she had to face legal harassment from the company and got no  assistance from her hospital or the university. The authors are firm in siding  with the researcher and suggest ways that such conflicts could be handled in  the future.

				<h4>The industry's influence</h4>
				<p>
					The relationships  between academic institutions and private companies are increasing with faculty  members and universities having increasingly strong financial and non-financial  incentives to participate directly in the development of drugs, devices, and  diagnostic tests. Many negative implications of this trend have been  recognised. The authors outline seven areas in which critical choices are to be  made and discuss how to face them.

				<h4>Working with the private sector</h4>
				<p>
					Cooperation between  academic institutions and the private sector does not always run smoothly. The  authors point to the need for guidance on entering into partnership with a  commercial partner and describe their institution's experience in formulating  guidelines for its staff.

				<h4>Researchers must document ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					Clinical investigators  rarely describe the rationale for ethically controversial features of study  design, or procedures instituted to enhance the protection of the subjects, or  how they ensured informed consent. To promote public accountability, the  article recommends a policy of extensive reporting of pertinent ethical issues.

				<h4>Strengthen ethics committees</h4>
				<p>
					Research involving  humans is subject to codes of ethical conduct that mandate review, approval,  and monitoring of clinical trials by research ethics committees (RECs). The  article recommends that RECs have a prominent role in ensuring that trial  results are publicly disseminated and proposes specific responsibilities for  the funders, host institutions, and consumers.

				<h4>The scientific-clinical interface</h4>
				<p>
					While ethics is  discussed as it pertains to clinical research, there is a need for such  discussion in basic science research, because both are increasingly intertwined  as in stem cell research. As potential financial rewards or fame beckon, it is  difficult to instil sound moral thinking in researchers.

				<h4>Non-financial conflicts</h4>
				<p>
					Increasing attention has  been paid to financial conflicts of interest in research. Non-financial  conflicts of interest on the part of investigators and institutions are just as  important. Investigators are motivated by the desire to advance knowledge,  prestige, and career advancement. Institutions wish to enhance their reputation  as research centres. These interests cannot be eliminated but need to be  managed appropriately.

				<h4>Tired doctors are dangerous</h4>
				<p>
					Sleep deprivation due to  extended work hours leads to fatigue which impairs human performance. In this  article, the authors discuss current and proposed policies concerning  clinicians' work hours and fatigue. A comprehensive strategy to reduce fatigue  is recommended.

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics in health policy</h4>
				<p>
					To address the problem  of inequality in health care, the authors recommend that policy makers must  determine which inequalities lead to inequitable outcomes and assess  cost-effectiveness of interventions. Ethics and social science, rather than  agenda setting and lobbying, should take centre stage in this international  policy debate.

				<h4>Dangerous NGOs</h4>
				<p>
					The author describes  working in a remote rural clinic in Nepal and struggling with outdated or very  high cost medicines donated by NGOs. As there was an established culture of  belief that Western is best, he had to be extra careful to teach good medical practice  which was sympathetic to the local customs. He says that though NGOs fulfil a  valuable role, their charitable status should be removed if they persist in  dangerous practices.

				<h4>More than just skill</h4>
				<p>
					When it comes to  doctoring, the term 'good' increasingly functions as a descriptive label that  denotes having met certain tests of competency. A poor doctor is generally  credited with good intentions but inadequate knowledge or skills required for  the job. A bad doctor, however skilled, is one with bad intentions, undesirable  values, suspect, occasionally evil, motives. Judging someone a bad doctor  implies serious defects of moral agency, even though these may coexist with  commendable aspects of medical practice. To become good doctors, medical  education should teach reflection and sensitivity along with skills.

				<h4>Why patients trust doctors</h4>
				<p>
					Despite the media's  fixation with medical errors and damaged patients, most doctors are good  doctors in the eyes of most patients. Patients' ratings of doctors'  interpersonal skills are strongly related to trust. To patients, trust means  honesty, openness, responsiveness, having one's best interests at heart, and  willingness to be vulnerable without fear of being harmed.

				<h4>Doctors and alternative medicines</h4>
				<p>
					This is an extremely  important article for Indian physicians. The authors have defined a  risk-benefit framework that can be applied to individual cases to determine  appropriateness of using these therapies. The physician can formulate a  clinically sound and ethically appropriate plan even in the absence of  scientific evidence for these therapies by keeping certain well defined issues  in mind.

				<h4>Why some people want to die</h4>
				<p>
					Oregon's 1997 Death with  Dignity Act legalises physician-assisted suicide. Since then many hospice  nurses and social workers have provided care for a patient who requested  assistance with suicide. The majority of these requests had been discussed at a  hospice interdisciplinary conference on patient care. Desire for control  was a very important reason for these requests. Less important were depression,  lack of social support and fear of being a financial drain on family members.

				<h4>Is all technology good?</h4>

					The author feels that as  a society we are more fascinated by technology and losing touch with human  issues. He illustrates his point of view by giving examples in his field where  the latest technological advance is pushed indiscriminately.

				<h4>Food or medicines?</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial comments  on the promotion of dietary supplements of unproven value, as medication.  Promotional techniques range from direct-to-consumer advertising, to getting  doctors to prescribe them, and stocking them in pharmaceutical stores. It is  unethical for doctors to prescribe untested products, particularly as "the  poor of this country are made to continue paying through their nose for  'nutritional/dietary supplements' at the cost of two square meals a day,"  notes the writer.

				<h4>Social responsibilities in genetic research</h4>
				<p>
					The Australian National  Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines on gene therapy have approved  somatic gene therapy but recommended a temporary ban on germ cell gene therapy  which makes inheritable changes with unknown long-term consequences. The writers  examine the question: does our duty not to create new risks for future  generations over-ride our duty to provide treatment to the present generation?  They conclude that "the community should take account of the interests of  its successors but this should not immobilise us in the decisions we make for  the present."

				<h4>Can the poor give informed consent?</h4>
				<p>
					The writer describes her  experiences as a member of an ethics review board and a professor at a public  teaching hospital in Manila. Poverty and the marginalisation of the poor, a highly  commercial medical system, the authority given to physicians, and impersonal,  alienating hospital settings all combine to create an environment undermining  people's ability to exercise free and informed consent. "In the Philippine  research context, if a doctor requests a hospitalized patient to participate in  a research project, then the patient is unlikely to refuse."

				<h4>More on informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					Few practical guidelines  exist on how to ensure that research participants in less-developed countries  understand the consent form before enrolment. In a study of HIV-1 transmission  in Haiti, participants were required to pass an oral examination on the  contents of the consent form with a passing score of 12/15 (80%) before  enrolment. Counsellors (80%) rather than physicians (20%) achieved better  outcomes.

				<h4>Making compassionate residents</h4>
				<p>
					House staff speak of  residency training as a 'test of survival' after which their 'real' careers  begin. However, these years will profoundly influence them as future  physicians. Narratives are used in this academic programme to encourage  self-reflection in order to make them better physicians, more compassionate  caregivers and more fully developed human beings.

				<h4>Do kidney sales benefit vendors?</h4>
				<p>
					The authors describe the  economic and health effects of selling a kidney. The survey of 305 individuals  who had sold a kidney in Chennai about six years prior to the survey revealed  that the average amount received was $1070. The main reason for selling was to  pay off debts. But 75% were still in debt at the time of the survey and over  86% reported a deterioration in their health status, with a 30% decline in  family income after the nephrectomy. 79% said that they would not advise others  to sell a kidney.
				</p>
				<p>
					A commentary on this  article summarises the various issues involved in the debate on cadaveric and  living donor organ donation. Selling an organ has been advocated by some as a  way out of poverty. The study provides clear proof that this is not true. The organ  recipient is the only one who stands to gain.

				<h4>An ethical market in live organs?</h4>
				<p>
					An article suggesting  that the selling and buying of human organs can be made ethical - with the  trade channelised through a single buyer such as the government health service  - triggered off a series of electronic responses. Marino and others point out  that this system will appeal only to a restricted group of people, the  cash-strapped. Wight notes that a market in live kidneys may lead to a collapse  in organ donation, thus heart and liver transplantation could be seriously  damaged. Wigmore et al question the notion that a single buyer would avoid  donor exploitation. No guarantee exists that the NHS would not exploit people.  The potential for harm to the donor remains. Also, fair distribution among  recipients needs to be addressed.

				<h4>Informing legal judgements on medicine</h4>
				<p>
					Judges are expected to  examine the basis of all expert testimony before it is introduced at trial to  ensure that it meets the same standards of intellectual rigour that  professionals use outside the courtroom. However, courts have been inconsistent  in measuring this testimony against the standards of medical practice.  Physicians should respond by correcting courts' misinterpretations of medical  practice and assisting in the development of legal standards that encourage  thoughtful and informed consideration of medical testimony by judges and  juries.

				<h4>Internet medicine and the law</h4>
				<p>
					The legal community  needs to devise ways to address the expansion of medicine over the Internet.  For a country like India, telemedicine and cybermedicine offer many advantages.  However, concerns about quality remain. The book discusses malpractice,  confidentiality, and informed consent as well as licensure, credentialing and  liability; access including standards for use, confidentiality, privacy; and  economic issues, reimbursement for services, funding and cost effectiveness.
