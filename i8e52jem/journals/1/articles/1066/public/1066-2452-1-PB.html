				<p>
					The reviewer recommends this book highly for its well-researched and clearly explained concepts of care at the end of life. The author has traced the history of end-of-life care from pre-hospice days to palliative care and beyond. The discussion on ethical dilemmas is informative to health care professionals and lawyers with no grounding in philosophy.

					<strong>David Rieff. <em>Swimming in a sea of death: a son's memoir</em>. Simon and Schuster; 2008. $21. Pp 192, ISBN: 978-0743299466. </strong> Reviewed by D Johnson et al. in <em>London Review of Books</em> 2008; 55(2). 
				</p>
				<p>
					The book is David Rieff's recounting of his experience dealing with his mother's death from a malignancy in 2004. His mother, Susan Sontag, was a renowned writer whose books included<em> Illness as a metaphor</em>, written in 1975, after her battle with metastatic breast cancer. In this she wrote about the language that is used to address cancer and death, and the difficulty the health profession had in dealing with death as an inevitable part of life. Yet Susan herself was unwilling to accept the inevitability of death, perhaps as a result of her two encounters with &lsquo;end-stage' cancers that she survived against all odds. The book describes her last illness and the effect it had on her son who was a witness to her fight, to the end, to live.
