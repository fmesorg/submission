              <h4>A community-based study on induced abortions: some unanswered questions</h4>
              <p>
                In their article on  community-based research on induced abortion, Ganatra and Hirve <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ganatra Bela and Hirve Siddhi. A community-based study on induced abortions. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 7-8." id="1">(1)</a> provide a  candid documentation of the many ethical dilemmas confronting those engaged in  research on sensitive issues related to reproductive and sexual health and  rights. The effort made by researchers to ensure adherence to ethical norms is  indeed commendable and exemplary. There are, however, a number of questions  that remained unanswered in the article. We raise these below, mainly with a  view to understand better the reasons why certain procedures and processes were  adopted, so that these may be emulated by future research studies on abortion.
                </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  What were the  research questions? Paragraph 2 of the article (Our own ..... socio-cultural  context) suggests that the research questions were as follows: 2. Where and how  do rural women access abortion services?
                  </li>
                <p>
                  What are the factors  influencing women's access to abortion services? How unequally is access to  services distributed across different population groups (by marital status,  parity, age, class, rural/urban residence, nature of health facility accessed,  etc.)?
                  </p>
                <p>
                  How are women's choices  of where to access abortion services modified by their socio-cultural context?
                  </p>
                <p>
                  If these were indeed the  research questions, then the need to use a case-identification method is not  clear. For example, answers to questions 1 and 3 could well be gathered through  focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with key informants. Gathering  case studies of detailed reproductive histories of women representing different  population groups would provide insights into a range of factors that influence  women's access to abortion services. Information on sensitive issues like  places from which single women access induced abortion services may be had from  key informants such as traditional midwives and medical practitioners and  paramedical workers servicing the area. Reproductive health surveys of women of  reproductive ages could also have achieved this end (see point 4 ).
                  </p>
                <p>
                  In all these cases,  there would be no need to identify specific persons and hence, elaborate  procedures to mask users of abortion services could have been avoided entirely.  And we would still be in a position to answer many of the questions we started  with.
                  </p>
                <p>
                  Since the research  included a three-month period to gauge the sensitivity to stigmatisation and  did identify different levels of stigmatisation corresponding to different  sub-groups of abortion-seekers, one wonders if it may not have been possible to  document case-studies from each of these. This would have helped understand  issues related to access to safe abortion services for these different groups.
                  </p>
                <li>
                  Cases identified  through clinic-based providers were enrolled prospectively. The power equations  between a medical professional and rural women being heavily tilted in favour  of the former, is it not likely that some women gave consent believing this is  what was expected of them, and owing to reluctance to offend the service  provider?
                  </li>
                <li>
                  The role of  community-based 'informants' is not clear. Did they provide information on  'cases'? Would this not represent breach of confidentiality? Why was it so  important to identify women who had recently undergone abortions through  third-party informants? Since the researchers have carefully considered this  issue, it is possible that their decision was based on the assessment that the  'benefits' of this potential breach of confidentiality outweighed the 'costs'.  However, why they reached this conclusion is not very clear from the article.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  The researchers note  that 'for most married women who had undergone an abortion with the knowledge  and support of her husband, the issue was neither overly sensitive nor  stigmatising' ( para 5). This is no doubt an accurate observation. So the  question is, why not carry out a general reproductive health survey covering  all women of reproductive ages (designed to capture an adequate sample of  induced abortions, based on an estimated induced abortion rate) in which women  report their induced abortions and answer open-ended questions pertaining to  where these were accessed, how they made their decisions and so on? In fact,  this is what appears to have been done even with the knowledge that a woman had  undergone induced abortion (para 1-2, p.8).
                  </li>
                <li>
                  Data were collected  prospectively and retrospectively; in the clinic setting and in the community  setting, from women who could not choose to deny their induced abortion  (because this information was obtained from the person who provided them these  services), and those who could choose to do so. These two sets of data may not  be comparable, and one wonders how this issue was reconciled for data analysis.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  Discontinuing the  interview if a woman reported her induced abortion as spontaneous may be sensitive,  but is it ethical? Is that not a reason to continue the interview to find out  if there was any related morbidity, its nature and severity and the source of  health care sought by the woman? These questions would not only help assess  whether the abortion was 'probably' or 'possibly' induced <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Belsey M. World Health Organization's studies differentiating between spontaneous and induced abortions. In Methodological issues in abortion research. New York: The Population Council, 1989." id="2">(2)</a>, but are  important in themselves to assess women's access to relevant reproductive  health services, and to provide or refer them in case of lack of access. This  is particularly important if one considers the possibility that women who have  undergone unsafe induced abortions may be at high risk of related  complications.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  In observing that  some women who had 'in fact' had an induced abortion chose to report it as  'spontaneous', the authors appear to have assumed that it is their informants  who reported the 'truth', and that the women did not. The basis of this  assumption is not clear. Could it be that the informants want to be helpful and  eager to be of service, and include among cases those who they only suspect to  have had an induced abortion?
                  </li>
                <li>
                  The article states  that when the woman was at risk of being stigmatised, she was not interviewed  at all, unless it was possible to do so in a clinic setting. In our experience  in a rural poor setting in Tamil Nadu, this is the group least likely to access  safe abortion services in a clinic setting, and most at risk of an 'unsafe'  abortion. Was the researchers' experience in Maharashtra different, and were  they able to interview this group of women in a clinic setting? If yes, could  they speculate on why their setting is different?
                  </li>
                <li>
                  The use of 'dummy'  interviews seems to be an unsatisfactory strategy to protect the 'case' for  several reasons. One, having a group of interviewers conducting several  simultaneous interviews could have been intimidating for the household  concerned. Did all these members give informed consent to be interviewed? If  they did, then using them as dummies amounts to misleading respondents who so  willingly give their time to answer questions, and appears to be a breach of  trust. Two, it must be possible to find other ways of ensuring privacy even in  a rural community, such as finding a room (the balwadi on a non-working day or  in the evening, the panchayat office, etc.) in which respondents are interviewed  in private, one by one. We have done this as part of several research studies  in villages in Tamil Nadu, and wonder what made this impossible in the  researchers' setting. Three, were the considerably higher costs that this  strategy is likely to have entailed justified? And finally, if the issue was  not very sensitive (because it is not sensitive for most married women and  other women were in any case interviewed only in a clinic setting), why was it  even necessary to have dummy clients?
                  </li>
                <li>
                  There are many  instances in the article where the authors single out qualitative methods as  intrusive, potentially threatening, leading to 'coercive participation' and  posing 'complex ethical dilemmas', implying that quantitative methods can be  absolved of these traits. (Paragraphs 1 and 4 on page 7 and the concluding  paragraph on page 8). Or have we misunderstood their stance?
                  </li>
                <li>
                  What is the  researchers' responsibility towards those in need of services for  abortion-related morbidity? Referring them to a medical facility may not be  meaningful, because women may not be able to access these for the same reasons  that prevented their using these facilities for a safe abortion in the first  place.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  It would be of value  for researchers like ourselves to learn about the ways in which findings from  this study have been (or will be) utilised to enable equitable access to  abortion services for future abortion seekers.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  We find the authors'  concluding remarks rather disconcerting. Why strive for an accurate estimate of  rates of utilisation or of morbidity at the cost of participants' dignity and  autonomy? Is not this concept rooted in benign paternalism that assumes 'we  know what is good for you (even if you don't).'?
                  </li>
                </ol>
              <p>
                To conclude, we agree  with the authors that we researchers have a responsibility to be up front about  the ethical dilemmas we confront. The questions above have been raised with a  view to continue the debate in the same spirit.
