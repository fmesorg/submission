  <p>Psychiatry  has been isolated from the mainstream of medicine; this has been bad for the  profession and worse for the mentally ill. This article discusses some  important ethical problems in the practice of psychiatry in India.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Common  ethical issues in medicine and psychiatry</h4>
  <p>
  Medicine is both a science and the art of healing. The dynamics of this  combination is best reflected in psychiatry, the branch of medicine which  specialises in the diagnosis and care of those who are suffering from mental  disorders. The past five decades have seen the establishment of general  hospital psychiatric units and the rise of private sector in psychiatry,  bringing psychiatry closer to general medicine but as a result, psychiatry is  now facing many ethical issues common to several other medical specialties.  These include-but are not limited to&mdash;commercialisation, an exaggerated emphasis  on laboratory investigations and technical procedures, increasing use of  self-advertisement, 'cut backs' for investigations or services, and an  unhealthy relationship with pharmaceutical firms. The Indian Association of  Private Psychiatry (IAPP) has discussed guidelines on the subject <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kala AK.

  <h4>Some  ethical issues peculiar to psychiatry</h4>
  <p>
    The practice of psychiatry is different from other medical specialties in two  significant respects. First, one deals with certain groups of patients whose  judgement may be impaired at times due to their mental illness or who are  unable to look after themselves. Such patients, at times, may also become a  danger to either themselves or others but may still refuse any medical help. In  such situations, therapeutic intervention or even detention in a psychiatric  facility against the patient's wishes may become necessary. This raises various  ethical and human rights issues that have been debated extensively without  arriving at a consensus.</p>
  <p>Second,  in no other medical specialty do patients share with their doctor so many  intimate details about their personal, emotional, social or even sexual life.  As a result, a special kind of relationship, both positive and negative,  develops between the patient and psychiatrist. This particularly happens during  prolonged treatment. This raises many ethical issues depending on how the  psychiatrist handles it.</p>

  <h4>National  and international ethical guidelines</h4>
  <p>
    The World Psychiatric Association (WPA) prepared the Declaration of Hawaii in  1977 after extensive discussion. This was updated in Vienna in 1983. The  revision in 1996 was called the Madrid Declaration <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Psychiatric Association. http://wpanet.org/home.html" id="2">(2)</a>. There is also a  Standing Committee for ethical issues. The UN General Assembly in 1991  specially considered the question of 'Principles for the protection of persons  with mental illness and for the improvement of mental health' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations. The protection of persons with mental illness and the improvement of mental health care. U.N. General Assembly Resolution (1991) A/Res/46.119." id="3">(3)</a>. In India,  the National Human Rights Commission's publication, Quality assurance in mental  health, provides guidelines for the care of mentally ill in psychiatric  institutions <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Human Rights Commission of India. Quality assurance in mental health. New Delhi: National Human Rights Commission of India, 1999." id="4">(4)</a>.</p>
  <p>The  essence of all these recommendations is that psychiatric patients should be  treated with dignity and respect. As far as possible, their consent must be  taken for any treatment or hospital admission. If such patients are not in a  position to give their consent, close family members should be consulted, but  the interest of the patient must remain paramount. Physical restraints, if  required, must be minimum and for a temporary period under close medical  supervision. The use of chains or other degrading devices to restrict the  patient should have no place in modern psychiatry. The patient should be kept  as involuntary admission in a psychiatric hospital for the minimum period  necessary. There must be adequate provisions for the right to appeal against  forcible detention. Many of these recommendations are included in the Mental  Health Act of 1987.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h4>Research  on patients with mental disorders</h4>
  <p>
    In general, it is agreed that for any medical research on human beings,  informed consent of the individual must be an essential part of the research  protocol. The difficulty in seriously mentally ill patients is that due to  their illness, many of them have their judgement substantially impaired. They  may not be in a position to judge the risks involved in various medical  research procedures. In India, where a large number of patients are poorly  educated, giving consent by signing some research protocol seems to be an inadequate  safeguard. The patients and their families inherently trust their doctors and  hence a big ethical responsibility falls on the treating doctor. A complete ban  on all research on the mentally ill may be going to one extreme. Two safeguards  are suggested. First, such research should be strictly limited to what is in  the larger interest of the mentally ill. Second, there must be independent  monitoring to ensure that ethical guidelines are followed. The Indian Council  of Medical Research must periodically review the ethical implications of  research on those who are seriously mentally ill.</p>

  <h4>The  question of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</h4>
  <p>
    The use of unmodified ECT is another subject of intense debate in India. Some  time ago, there was a lively exchange on the subject <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:9-10." id="5">(5</a>, <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pathare S. Beyond ECT: priorities in mental health care in India. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:11-12." id="6">6</a>, <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mirsky J. China's Psychiatric Terror. New York Review of Books. February 27, 2003." id="7">7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kendra. Out of mind, out of sight. Chennai: Banyan, 2002." id="8">8)</a>. One section seems  to favour unmodified ECT in certain circumstances, while the other holds that  unmodified ECT, without anaesthesia, has no place in modern psychiatry. I find  myself close to the latter position for the following reasons:</p>
  <p>With  the availability of modern antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, the role of  ECT has been greatly reduced. I know many successful colleagues who have rarely  used ECT in the past five years or so in their private practice.</p>
  <p>Second,  there will be a few people in psychiatric hospitals or general hospital  psychiatric units who will require ECT, and it may even be life saving in some  situations. It must be ensured that ECT is provided with anaesthesia and muscle  relaxants. There should be no compromise on this issue. If direct ECT is easily  available it may be overused and misused, as happens in many mental hospitals  located remote areas.</p>
  <p>'The  convulsion looks frightening to the viewer; this perpetuates the myth that ECT  is a barbaric treatment.' <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:9-10." id="5">(5)</a> This statement gives the impression that the  feelings of viewers&mdash;family members, health care staff-are not important in this  matter since the patient does not remember the fit. I do not agree. In our  society, people already have strong prejudices against psychiatric patients.  Any treatment which appears to be 'barbaric' or 'frightening' to the general  public will further reduce the acceptance of psychiatry in the mainstream of  medicine. For this reason alone, unmodified ECT should be stopped.</p>

  <h4>Crossing  clinical boundaries</h4>
  <p>This  subject has been extensively debated in the medical literature in the US and  Europe where there are many more psychiatrists and psychotherapy is quite  common. The psychiatrist-patient relationship can continue for a long time and  strong positive (and sometimes negative) feelings can develop for the therapist  and vice versa. It is a part of the psychiatrist's training to handle such  situations carefully. The guiding principle is always the interest of the  patient who has come for help. The WPA's Madrid Declaration states: 'Under no  circumstances should a psychiatrist get involved with a patient in any form of  sexual behaviour, irrespective of whether this behaviour is initiated by the  patient or the therapist.' <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Psychiatric Association. http://wpanet.org/home.html" id="2">(2)</a></p>

<div class="section">
  <h4>'The  real issues in mental health'</h4>
  <p>
    I have borrowed this sub-heading from Dr Pathare's article <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pathare S. Beyond ECT: priorities in mental health care in India. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:11-12." id="6">(6)</a>. I fully share  his views in this matter. For me, the most important national ethical issue is  how to ensure that the benefit of modern psychiatry is available to all  sections of our population. Unfortunately, it is not happening at present. Poor  patients from rural or slum areas, especially women, get little benefit from  modern psychiatry. The book <em>Out of mind, out of sight</em> beautifully describes the  plight of homeless women with mental illness in India <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kendra. Out of mind, out of sight. Chennai: Banyan, 2002." id="8">(8)</a>. We must remember the  distressing sight of the wandering 'lunatic' or mentally ill with torn clothes,  with nothing to eat, ridiculed by passers-by. We must ensure that such  degrading sights to human dignity disappear from India and essential  psychiatric services are available to such unfortunate patients. The best  methods, as mentioned by Dr Pathare and by many others and also recommended in  WHO's <em>World mental health report</em> 2001, are to provide services through primary  health care in the community, increase the number of mental health  professionals, supply essential drugs and most importantly, educate the public  to reduce the stigma and discrimination due to mental illness so that patients  and their families do not hide the mental illness but avail psychiatric  services on time <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.
