				<h4>Ship of Theseus, Producer: Sohum Shah, Director: Anand Gandhi. English with Hindi, Arabic, Swedish.143 minutes, 2012.</h4>
				<p>
					Anand Gandhi's <em>Ship of Theseus</em> is a visual and  intellectual feat, one that is able to ask fundamental questions about our relationship with our bodies in the  modern world. The film reveals how the maintenance and management - under fast-paced scientific innovation - of the able body that sees, resists internal  degeneration and replaces defunct organs to live for as long as possible is  more under medical control, and under the control of capital, than we think.  This is a world in which organs are a part of global traffic and circulate  within a system of capital flow. Gandhi raises deeply philosophical questions  against the background of this material context, exploring issues related to  ethics, political action and choice.

					Each  of the three stories that make up this film asks us some very difficult  questions, thankfully without offering simplistic solutions. The central  dilemma presented at the start of the movie is: if all the old wooden planks of the ship of Theseus were replaced by new  ones, and the old ones re-assembled to form another ship, which then, if either,  is the real ship of Theseus? The film goes on to add layer upon layer to this,  and pushes us to think about the relationship between a part and the whole, and  how we perceive and position ourselves in a larger system of social relations.

					In the first story, the blind photographer, Aaliya (Aida  Al-Kashef), navigates the city, directing her camera at sounds that arrest her.  Her aim is to capture, document and archive moments as they occur around her.  Despite her disability, she is able to retain remarkable control over her  images. However, once she is able to see again (a cornea replacement operation  restores her vision), the sudden onrush of visual stimuli in the city confuses  her and she seems incapable of taking good photographs any more. It is only when  she goes to the mountains for inspiration that she is able to understand what  it means to stop and take stock of her surroundings with new eyes. As her lens  cap accidently falls into a stream, we understand that her eyes have been  symbolically opened forever.

					The  second story begins with a monk, Maitreya (Neeraj Kabi), walking barefoot  through the city in the pouring rain. The monk, gentle yet formidable, is on  his way to a court hearing for a case against pharmaceutical companies that  perform tests on animals for non-essential and cosmetic research. Through  conversations between the erudite Maitreya and Charvaka, a zippy young  lawyer-apprentice also on the case, we learn that Maitreya believes that all  existence - and not just all humanity - has a life force. He also believes in  taking responsibility for his every action (and inaction). As we view a scene  that makes us cringe - a shampoo is being tested on a rabbit which is writhing  desperately - we are confronted with the possibility of accepting Maitreya's  argument on fundamental ethical grounds, rather than on religious grounds (at  one point, he expresses his desire to hold a dialogue with the medical  community). Yet, once he realises he has liver cirrhosis, Maitreya is faced  with a choice between the very principles he stands for and his life.

					The third story gives us a powerful overview of the global  flow of body parts today, and deserves a special mention from a bio-ethics  perspective. Navin (Sohum Shah) is an unsophisticated stockbroker, the grandson  of an earnest woman who runs an NGO. The tension between the two is palpable.  While she thinks he is obsessed with money and does nothing to reach out to  people who "need his compassion," he thinks her "revolutionary" ways are  stifling and useless. (The two argue in a well-executed scene right after he  helps her urinate into a bedpan in a hospital.) Things change for Navin when he  comes face-to-face with Shankar, a labourer who has had one of his kidneys  stolen in the course of an appendix operation. Navin, who has just had a kidney  replacement operation, is deeply shaken by this. Even after his doubts about  whether his own surgery was the result of a donation have been laid to rest, he  launches a search for Shankar's buyer-recipient. This takes him halfway across  the globe to Stockholm. The buyer-recipient is a white man who, when confronted  by Navin, first evades the subject, then becomes defensive and eventually  breaks down. He offers to pay Shankar more money, but Navin wants a kidney for  Shankar. We realise that today, capital disperses body parts in an economy that  literally steals a poor man's kidney and puts it in the body of a hapless  foreigner, who has the power but not the ability to see the context in which he  is placed.

					This  circulation, in which we rent or sell parts of ourselves that could not earlier  be rented or sold (think surrogacy, clinical trials, organ and blood  donation/sale, stem cell research, etc), reflects the vulnerability of our  bodies to the power of capital. Such transactions are taking place in newer and  newer ways every day. This trend raises a plethora of questions regarding  medical ethics, the marriage of capital and science (especially  biotechnologies), regulation and the role of the State, and the larger issues  relating to poverty, rights and livelihoods. Together with the second, this  last story seeks to understand individual choices within the varied contexts in  which they are made.
				</p>
				<p>
					The three stories come together seamlessly at the end of the  film. The movie leaves us contemplating questions related to identity, as well  as the costs at which scientific advances that give us an opportunity to lead a  better/longer life are made possible.
