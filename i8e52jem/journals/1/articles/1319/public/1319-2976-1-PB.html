				<h4>Ethics and the medical student</h4>
				<p>
					What does the medical student in India  understand by the word 'bioethics'? This survey of 125 first-year students in  the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the University College of  Medical Sciences found a good deal of ignorance on the subject, compared to,  for example, a subject such as AIDS. Still, many students had strong opinions  on subjects such as acceptance of gene therapy and other scientific  developments. The authors conclude that students feel the need for ethics  related education. Such an education should exist at various levels, including  bioethics education at the college level and beyond. "... many students are not  comfortable with the concepts that are very important for the development of  professional health care workers and scientists who will be faced with moral  dilemmas in their daily work after graduation."

				<h4>Medical practice in south Asia</h4>
				<p>
					This physician  trained in the US describes the lessons learned through encounters with  patients while practising in Pakistan. "In Pakistan, as in many non-Western  cultures, decisions about a patient's health are often made by the family or  the doctor. ...the Pakistani approach requires striking a balance between preserving  indigenous values and carving out room for patients to participate in their  medical decisions." The importance of religion, the respect given to the  physician, the conflict between the family as the fundamental social unit, and  economic realities, the importance of beneficence and non-maleficence rather  than patient autonomy &mdash; sensitive physicians must take into account such issues  as part of their practice.

				<h4>Authorship</h4>
				<p>
					This essay on  publishing ethics covers details such as the need to define authorship,  multi-centre studies, student-faculty studies, acknowledging support, rights  and responsibilities of authors, and an evaluation of guidelines on authorship.  The writers conclude: "...in spite of the rules, regulations and recommendations,  ... It is only the authors whose principled behaviour can give these guidelines  some meaning... manuscripts should be written to become a record of discovery,  not just a curriculum vitae for every working scientist."

				<h4>Brain death</h4>
				<p>
					With increasingly  sophisticated life sustaining techniques, the determination of death can be a  very specialised task today, going beyond measuring heartbeat and breathing.  Standards for diagnosing death using brain-based criteria are widely accepted  internationally. Still, discussions on 'brain death' are filled with  'metaphysical, cultural, legal, and medical controversy'. The reason: a  lack of precision reflects conceptual confusion on the part of medical and  professionals, and creates it in the minds of the public.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Since 'brain-dead'  patients show such traditional signs of life as warm, moist skin, a pulse, and  breathing, it is not surprising that many people seem to think that 'brain  death' is a separate type of death that occurs before 'real' death." This  confusion is reinforced when doctors speak of 'life support' being removed from  such patients, and when judges state: "When the life-supporting measures were  suspended, death ensued [although the person] was legally dead even before  heroic life support procedures were discontinued."
				</p>
				<p>
					Ongoing debates on  defining death according to loss of function of the 'higher brain' death as  opposed to the 'whole brain', and challenges to this concept of death on  medical grounds, further confuse the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The notion that brain  death is different from ordinary death continues to affect policy debates,  perplexing the public and also leading some to believe that they can  choose between different standards of death. This last suggests that the  definition is purely utilitarian, and naturally contributes to people's  ambivalence about organ donation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The writer concludes  that physicians applying current standard criteria and tests for determining  death should be very clear about the 'conceptual foundations of the definition  they are implementing'. They should 'avoid terms such as "brain death" and  allow families time to understand the basis of a diagnosis of death that is not  self-evident when the respirator-supported body of their loved one manifests  many outward signs of life.'

				<h4>Equal access with resource  constraints</h4>
				<p>
					A recent UK inquiry  report charged that children with Down's syndrome were discouraged from  necessary cardiac surgery, and recommended that the profession should ensure  that people with disabilities have equal access to care on the basis of need.  This provocative editorial challenges the assumptions of the inquiry report.  Though both UK law and the European Convention on Human Rights will hold such  practices unlawful, decisions to provide care with limited resources will  definitely measure the relative improvement in quality of life. Such decisions  are taken routinely, for example when deciding not to transplant for a person  with brain injury or dementia, on the basis that scarce organs would do more  good for people without such impairments. The equality of access principle  would give equal right to both patients; but the quality of life principle will  give priority to the patient who will benefit most. "We should face reality:  quality and length of life and probability of benefit (and cost of treatment)  are relevant in determining who should receive treatment. Severe disability in  some circumstances should disqualify a person from access to scarce  resources."
                    Down's syndrome is associated with intellectual disability,  infertility, reduced opportunities for independent living and employment,  shorter life, and early onset Alzheimer's disease." The author concedes  that considerable variation exists in the quality of life of people with  disability for which reason every case for heart transplantation should be  judged on its merits, assessing all factors, but "including the likelihood of a  good outcome."
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course the better  alternative is to increase health expenditure and improve organ donation rates.  "One terrible constraint that forces us to decide between people would then be  removed."

				<h4>Reacting to a medical error</h4>
				<p>
					n When the junior  doctor realises that his failure to read a patient's ECG resulted in the  patient's death, he went directly to the consultant &mdash; who falsified records to  cover up the truth. A doctor describes his first, tragic medical mistake 15  years earlier, and how his senior covered it up. He reflects on the need for  medical audit, and the benefits and harms of publicising the mistake to the  individual family, the junior doctor and the medical system as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The publication of  every medical mistake may cause widespread harm and result in a mistrust of  medicine. This does not mean that serious errors should be routinely and  uncritically swept under the carpet. However, a first occurrence is probably  best seen as an opportunity for education not litigation. In the long term such  a course may help make us more careful and considerate physicians."
				</p>
				<p>
					Three commentaries  highlight the dangers of cover-ups&mdash; procedural and systemic problems which led  to the error are not addressed; the trust between physician and patient is  breached, and doctors learn to cover up mistakes instead of taking  responsibility for them and learning from them.

				<h4>The condolence letter</h4>
				<p>
					When a patient dies,  do Indian doctors even dream of sending a condolence letter to the family? The  writers suggest that a " physician's responsibility for the care of a patient does  not end when the patient dies. There is one final responsibility &mdash; to help the  bereaved family members. A letter of condolence can contribute to the healing  of a bereaved family and help achieve closure in the relationship between the  physician and the patient's family."
				</p>
				<p>
					However, doctors are  either too busy, or they otherwise feel uncomfortable with the idea of writing  such letters, though the physician's was much more intimately part of the  mourning process in earlier days.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The doctor's role at  the time of mourning has also become more distant and less supportive.  Physicians are not trained to support a bereaved family."
				</p>
				<p>
					Such actions  especially help families cope with the anger of unexpected death, and their  absence can provoke suspicion. They also help the physician experience a sense  of closure. They also serve as a model for other staff.. The writers see  writing condolence letters as a professional responsibility, and offer  suggestions on how to write one.

				<h4>The conjoined twins</h4>
				<p>
					The UK courtroom  battle last year between the parents of conjoined twins and their doctors  illustrates "the difficulty of applying legal principles to unprecedented life-and-death  decisions involving proposed medical interventions for children &mdash; particularly  when parents and physicians disagree about what should be done."
				</p>
				<p>
					The twins' parents,  who are Roman Catholic, came to England for medical care when the mother was  pregnant and tests showed the twins were conjoined, in the hope of getting  treatment. Physicians held that surgical separation was the only way to save  one child, at the cost of the other's life. When the parents refused to give  consent for the procedure, the doctors went to court.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the judge ruled  in favour of separation, the parents, and the official solicitor representing  child who would die, appealed. The appeals court upheld the ruling.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author argues  that the imagery and logic presented in the appeals judges' opinions indicate  their bias towards doctors' right to decide, and their lack of empathy for the  parents and their religious beliefs. In fact, the case is really about the  rights of doctors over parents, not about whether medical intervention was  needed by law.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author's own view  is that the physicians should not have sought court intervention, but tried to  obtain the parents' consent before separating the twins. "I would have liked to  have had the parents agree to the separation, but I do not believe the case for  separation is so strong that it demands that the authority to make the decision  about the medical care of their children be taken away from the parents."
				</p>
				<p>
					(Interestingly, a  similar situation in India had  very different consequences. The press reported that doctors called for  surgical separation, though there was no assurance that even one child would  survive the procedure. The parents refused to let their children be surgically  separated, on the grounds that they were a gift from God. Indeed, thousands  made religious pilgrimages to see the children. In a country where the poor  have to fight for access to basic care, there was no question of a hospital  insisting on surgical intervention.)
