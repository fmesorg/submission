				<h4>Unmodified ECT vs  modified ECT</h4>
				<p>
					This letter refers to the article by Chittaranjan Andrade  regarding the use of unmodified ECT <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:9-10." id="1">(1)</a>. The author has discussed the obvious  advantages of modified ECT over unmodified ECT. He also highlights the ground  realities and difficulties in practice of modified ECT. The author concludes  that the use of unmodified ECT may be preferable to no ECT, as in the case when  ECT is indicated but anaesthesiological facilities are unavailable or unaffordable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though I agree in  principle with the points raised and this discussion may be scientifically  correct, we need to know the views of the people who are going to be recipients  of such treatment. It has been seen that doctors show remarkably little  interest in their patients' views of the procedure and its effects on them <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abrams R. Patients attitudes, legal-regulatory issues, and informed consent. In: Abrams R (ed). Electroconvulsive therapy. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997." id="2">(2)</a>.  I think that in this discussion on the ethical issues of administering  unmodified ECT, a patient's perspective is not being considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though no data are  available, most of the patients who refuse ECT do so because of the fear  associated with the procedure. This fear may be attributed to the gruesome and  barbaric picture of ECT projected by the media in which patients are shown  screaming and refusing ECT and later on convulsing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The use of unmodified  ECT would only increase this fear and lead to rejection and disrepute of this  really effective modality of treatment for psychiatric disorders at the hands  of the media and anti-ECT lobbies.
