				<h4>Surgery of the Soul: Reflections on a Curious Career. Joseph E Murray. Science History Publications, USA, $35, pp 255</h4>

				<p>
					Dr Joseph E Murray has blazed a trail of innovation  and excellence in transplantation surgery and reconstructive surgery. His  research in transplantation laid the basis for much that is practised today.
				</p>
				<p>
					His autobiography includes stories of individual patients  who &mdash; as all surgeons know &mdash; are the real heroes. The 'soul' of the book is the  story of Mr Raymond McMillan, born with a severe facial deformity known as  Moebius Syndrome. The chapter titled 'Surgery of the Soul' is the story of this  extraordinary individual whose initial years were spent in mental institutions.  The repair of Mr McMillan's complex facial deformity was complicated by the  fact that he had a heart defect. Ray's writings, uncovered after his death,  reveal a rare human being with an uncanny insight into the workings of his own  mind &mdash; and his efforts at modifying them:
				</p>
				<p>
					"I promised myself to be strong that nothing  could disturb my peace of mind. To talk health and make all my friends feel  that there is something in them...To give so much time to the improvement of  myself that I have no time to criticise others. To be too large for worry, too  noble for anger, too strong for fear and too happy to permit the presence of  trouble. To think well of myself and to proclaim this fact to the world-not  in loud worlds but in great deeds. To live in the faith that that the world is  on my side so long as I am true to the best that is in me."(p210)
				</p>
				<p>
					These are some of the most inspiring words I have  read. Dr Murray was fortunate to have patients such as Ray. He writes,  "the impact the hospital staff and I had on Ray's life only partially  involved scalpels and sutures... because we cared for him and showed him human  compassion and basic human kindness, we gave him a feeling of worth and helped  heal his spirit... the greatest benefit we gave Ray was not so much the  freedom to control his facial muscles, but rather the freedom for his inner  self to grow and glow... surely this was a case of true Surgery of the Soul. With  Ray as the benchmark for the highest form of cosmetic surgery, it becomes  apparent that the speciality is too precious to trivialise. Ray's life  reinforces the principles of the Hippocratic Oath. All life is precious.  His words remind us that our talents and skills can serve in unexpected ways...  service to society is the rent we pay for living on this planet." (page  210).

					Dr Joseph Murray decided to become a surgeon very  early in his life, influenced by his family doctor Dr George F Curley. He grew  up in a farm, and went to the local school. He got into Harvard medical school  after an education in liberal arts and sciences. We get glimpses of the young  doctor's keen interest in basic and clinical research. We learn of the tough  surgical residency programme at Massachussetts General Hospital where he was  fortunate to have mentors like Dr Francis D Moore and Dr George W Thorn. Later  he did original work on immunology and perfected surgical techniques in  transplantation. Dr Murray was responsible for the first successful human renal  transplant, on December 23, 1954, between identical twins Richard and Ronald  Herrick. He was also responsible for the first non-identical twin renal  transplantation, and the first cadaveric renal transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					From the very first transplant, he laid the  foundation for ethical debate on the subject by involving psychologists,  psychiatrists and the clergy in the discussions. He and his team at Harvard  were meticulous in their basic research, applying the results of animal  experiments with utmost ethical concern for patients, and only then launching a  surgical procedure This is in sharp contrast to what happened in the field of  cardiac transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Murray's real interest was the field of  reconstructive surgery where he pioneered the concept of reconstruction after  radical surgery for head and neck cancer. He was also involved in the  development of reconstructive surgery for congenital malformations. This also  took him on international medical missions to India (he operated at Christian  Medical College, Vellore) and Iran.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Murray met Bobby during medical school days and  married her during his surgical residency. We get to know the supporting role  played Bobby throughout his 'curious career' as she liked to call it, and  through his illness &mdash; he suffered an unexpected stroke in 1986 from which  he fortunately recovered. The crowning glory of his career was the conferment  of the Nobel Prize in 1990.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Murray's autobiography is written in an easy,  personal style embellished with stories of unforgettable patients and events.  His empathy and honesty shine through the book which is so engrossing it can be  finished in one read.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Surgery of the Soul</em> is a 'must read' for every medical  professional. Each will find something specially appealing to his or her  interest, in addition to the overall appeal of the book of a 'curious career'  of a remarkable doctor.
