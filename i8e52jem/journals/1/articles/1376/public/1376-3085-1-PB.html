				<h4>A campaign to take on corrupt medical practice</h4>
				<p>
					We work in community  health, and three members of our group have been running small nursing homes in  the rural areas of Nashik district. Nashik is a booming city, 200 km from  Mumbai and has the latest medical university of Maharashtra state.
				</p>
				<p>
					In October last year, we  had sent a patient to a leading private hospital in Nashik for emergency care.  The patient, Ms Mangala Gangurde, was suffering from pre-eclampsia and hails  from a poor tribal family in Dindori block. We sent her to the private hospital  since people are generally unwilling to go to government hospitals in emergency  situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					In January this year, we  received a cheque of Rs 1,941 from the hospital. After our initial puzzlement,  we realised that this was a 'cut' or 'commission'. We deposited the cheque in  our bank, issued a cheque in Ms Gangurde's name and gave it to her in front of  several villagers including two panchayat samiti members. Then we wrote a letter  to the hospital saying this was against medical ethics. We sent statements to  local papers in Nashik, on the need to act against such unethical practices and  to forge corrective mechanisms (two papers, Sakal and Deshdoot, have carried  the statement) Meanwhile, we also met some doctors in Nashik to see if a group  can emerge around the subject.
				</p>
				<p>
					The realities of medical  practice today are very harsh. The government health sector is demoralised and  is working in tandem with the private sector. The private sector has given up  whatever values it had in the 1970s. It is throwing in cuts and commissions,  parties, favours, even cash advances to all and sundry, including quacks and  rickshaw-wallas, to achieve its targets. Unnecessary procedures are on the  rise and 'cutting work' is the buzzword of today. In a rapid survey of three  talukas in Nashik we counted 250 private doctors, three of them MBBS, half with  ayurveda, homeopathy and electropathy degrees and half without any. Apart from  administering injections and salines for guaranteed incomes, they also get  their share of cash from speciality and super speciality hospitals &mdash; cuts of  anything from 10 to 40 per cent. The cheque we got was just evidence of this  deplorable practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					We could have lodged a  complaint with the medical council, but we hope to spark some internal reform  in the medical sector by avoiding legal action. The challenge however is  daunting.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are reforms possible? We  can roll back the situation as it exists today and bring everything under a  public health system; that public systems are also sick in our country is  another problem to reckon with. Given the situation, we think there are some  ways for reforms. One is to insist on accreditation of health facilities at all  levels. This can be either done through existing regulatory mechanisms (Bombay  Nursing Home Regulation Act) or an independent body can take this up even as a  profitable venture. For the rating system we need to consider the scientific/ technical level of the institute/facility, the ethical and accountability  standards, the billing procedures and fee rates.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second step would be  to network with accredited institutes in regional organisations like the health  maintenance organisations of the USA, starting from dispensaries to hospitals.  With a medical financing component and measures to minimise health risks, such  an organisation can be a wholesome answer to our current impasse-high costs  and no accountability.

				<p>
					<em>In their letter to the  president of the IMA, Nashik, Drs Ratna and Shyam Ashtekar note: </em>
				</p>
				<p>
					"... The name of the  hospital issuing the commission is immaterial and the practice is spreading...  We are concerned about this matter and its consequences, such as unnecessary  referrals and hospitalisations, procedures for favours; monetary loss to the patient/ consumer; tie-ups with practitioners who do unscientific practices, and  permanent damage to the doctor-patient relationship.
				</p>
				<p>
					"... Such 'favors' will  definitely hurt all honest practitioners if they do not do something urgently  to stop the deterioration... We must not ignore helpless patients who in their  hours of ordeal lean on us for life and limb.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Hospitals like ours in  the rural areas have to face several odds and limitations. The sole plank of  safety for us is the confidence and faith people have in us. The business of  commissions hurts this immunity and the spirit of the medical profession. This  is a request to the IMA for urgent action. We feel it is a system-problem, not  a problem of hospital A or B."
