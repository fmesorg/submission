					<strong>Peush Sahni</strong> discusses the ethical issues raised by the first strike of faculty members of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					The  Government of India set up the Fifth Pay Commission to revise the salaries of  its employees. The Commission submitted its report and in 1997, the government  implemented most of its recommendations for Central Government employees. The  All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, was created by legislation  enacted by Parliament as an autonomous institution with certain specified  objectives as an institution of national importance. Hence, the pay structure  of the faculty members of this institution was approved by Parliament.  Subsequently, with each pay commission's recommendations a procedure was  followed for the pay revision. Essentially, a committee was formed under the  chairmanship of the health secretary, which would recommend the revisions  keeping in mind the recommendations of the pay commission. In all such  situations previously, this committee's recommendations were accepted and  implemented by the government.

				<h4>The methods</h4>
				<p>
					As in the previous instances, the government set up a committee under the  chairmanship of the then health secretary to consider the revision of pay  scales of the faculty members of AIIMS in the light of the Fifth Pay  Commission's recommendations. This committee submitted its recommendations to  the government. The government did not accept these recommendations, instead  issued an order implementing essentially a direct conversion of the previous  pay scales to the new pay scales recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission. As  this was in contravention of past precedence, the faculty members of AIIMS did  not accept the revised pay scales.

				<h4>The dispute</h4>
				<p>
					Attempts were made by the faculty to have direct discussions with  governmental representatives to resolve this dispute without recourse to an  agitation. In the face of little progress, the faculty members resolved to take  mass casual leave for one day to press for resolution of the dispute. An appeal  was made by the Prime Minister to the faculty members to withdraw their  applications for casual leave. However, the faculty decided not to withdraw  their casual leave applications but in deference to the appeal of the Prime  Minister continued to perform their duties to avoid any hardship to the end  users of their service - the patients. Repeated attempts to resolve the dispute  did not result in any meaningful action and therefore the faculty proceeded on  an indefinite strike unprecedented in the history of AIIMS. A public interest  litigation was filed in the Delhi High Court by a concerned citizen pleading  for banning the AIIMS strike as well as strikes by doctors all over the  country. The faculty members of AIIMS withdrew their strike on the intervention  of the Delhi High Court. The High Court passed interim orders for implementation  of the recommendations of the committee chaired by the health secretary and  directed the government to resolve the dispute by 30 June 1999. However, the  matter is still sub-judice and awaiting a final resolution.

				<h4>The key players</h4>
				<p>
					The three key players in this dispute are the government, the faculty of  AIIMS and the patient. The impact of the actions of one led to consequences  suffered by the other two. The other minor players in this conflict are the  students, nurses and other health care staff of the AIIMS. The impact on them  would be of an indirect nature except in the case of the students who would  suffer in case of a prolonged strike which may have resulted in rescheduling of  teaching programmes, examinations and even extension of the duration of their  tenures. However, this did not happen. The teaching programmes were rescheduled  but the examinations were not postponed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The patients</h4>
				<p>
					They were affected maximally for no fault of theirs as innocent  bystanders between two warring groups. Could they have done something to  resolve the dispute and thus avoid the hardship? Possibly not. Even today we  lack aware and conscious citizens in our country. Few people are willing to  come forward to help resolve a dispute which does not affect them directly. As  the number of people affected by the strike at AIIMS would be a minuscule  proportion of the total population of our country it is unlikely that they  could have made any impact to the resolution of the dispute. However, the  public interest litigation filed by 'a concerned citizen' in the Delhi High  Court did give an impetus to resolution of the immediate crisis.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The faculty</h4>
				<p>
					The dispute arose when the government, without assigning any reasonable  explanation, decided to do away with the previous precedents. It also possibly  arose from an increasing perception of 'neglect' of the AIIMS by the  government. Could they have adopted a different course of action and still  hoped to achieve a just resolution of the dispute? Having failed to elicit a  response from various government functionaries, members of Parliament and  ministers, whom they approached to explain their predicament, they had few  other choices. Also, the government had acceded to pay-related demands of two  other sections of health care workers (nurses and paramedical personnel) in the  recent past only after they had gone on strike.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The government</h4>
				<p>
					As the prime decision maker it had the maximum ability to resolve the  dispute. Having accepted the previous precedents as correct and setting up a  committee to decide the pay scales of the faculty, it should have continued to  follow the precedent and accepted the committee's recommendations. However, if  it felt that it had made a mistake it should have corrected it prior to setting  up the committee or before the committee gave its recommendations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Resolving disputes in the health sector</h4>
				<p>
					With the dispute clearly defined it should have been possible to put  into place a mechanism to arrive at a just, well argued, amicable solution.  Unfortunately, neither does such a mechanism exist nor was any attempt made to  create it to solve this dispute. While disputes are bound to occur, the need to  resolve them without recourse to an agitation is of paramount importance. The  lack of a process to resolve disputes is the prime reason for the increasing  number of agitations in the health sector. Necessarily, this process would need  to be such that the 'agitated' and the 'agitator' would both have confidence in  obtaining a just solution.
