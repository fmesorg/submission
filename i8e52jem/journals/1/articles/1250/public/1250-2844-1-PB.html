              <p>Ethics, as a code of conduct, go beyond the law. Based
                on values and morals, they are grounded in the culture
                of the land, and are open to different interpretations.
                In addition, ethics in research are modulated to some extent
                by the culture of "science." It is encouraging that ethical
                guidelines for social science research in health in India have
                been formulated recently <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="CEHAT: Ethics in Social Sciences and Health Research. I will add the latest, complete citation" id="1">(1)</a>. Researchers should use such
                guidelines as a starting point for critical thought and
                reflection, rather than adhere to them blindly.
                Often researchers consider ethical questions only while
                developing research proposals. Proposals are formulated
                so that they meet the standards and format set by funders
                or research institutions. In practical terms, ethical
                considerations are often reduced to obtaining informed
                consent and writing a few lines on how confidentiality and
                privacy of the "research subjects" will be maintained. Ethical
                concerns and considerations should, in fact, ideally be on
                the agenda throughout the research process, from research
                design to data collection, from data analysis to
                dissemination. Consideration of ethical issues in research
                needs to be a dynamic process that involves not only the
                principal investigator but also the whole research team,
                especially members who collect data in the "field." In this
                paper I will make a case for considering ethical issues
                throughout the research process by illustrating how the
                practical aspects of conducting research challenge our
                understanding and application of ethical principles. I will
                conclude by suggesting how some ethical dilemmas in
              research may be resolved.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="section">
  <h4>The gray and the not-so-gray</h4>
  <p>Ethical principles that seem clear in theory become less clear
    when applied to a particular research project and become
    hazier still in the field setting. Black and white merge into
    infinite shades of gray. Ethical principles, distinct and
    mutually exclusive on paper, may be in conflict or violate
    each other. For instance, when we think of autonomy we
    usually have a responsible adult in mind. When the research
    subject is a child, most researchers agree that the permission
    of parents or the guardian is necessary. But the procedure
    to be followed is less clear when the research subject is an
    adolescent. Most researchers agree that the autonomy of
    the "subject" is primary. In a research project concerning
    fifteen-year-olds, would it be adequate to obtain the research
    subject's consent? Would the procedure depend on the
    research topic (for example, sexual behaviour)? A strong
    argument could be made that the parent's or guardian's
    permission should be sought. On the other hand, the adolescent may be willing to participate only if complete
    confidentiality is assured. This dilemma was faced in a
    research project on adolescents. A via media was found by
    obtaining the permission of the school and its teachers and
    interviewing the adolescent on the school premises. This
    "solution" is working but the researchers are still uneasy. It
    is not clear whose interest should be given precedence: the
    adolescent's or the parents' and teachers'.</p>
  <p>In another project, the bid to maintain privacy violated
    confidentiality. In a study on infectious disease, in order to
    maintain privacy while conducting interviews, the
    researchers obtained a separate room in a clinic. However,
    this made easy it for study subjects to be identified.</p>
  <p>Notions of autonomy, privacy, confidentiality and consent
    have been evolved largely in medical research projects in
    Western institutional settings. These concepts cannot be
    transplanted to studies that are conducted in the community
    settings with diverse cultures and ethos. The researcher
    faces many dilemmas, especially in community-based studies,
    even in terms of informed consent and disclosure of purpose
    of the study <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Priya, R.: Qualitative Research in public health: perspectives and ethics, Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; VIII(4): 113-114." id="2">(2)</a>. Consent has to be obtained from community
    representatives or gatekeepers, family members and the
    individuals, and the purpose of the research has to be
    explained to them. Does the researcher prepare a common
    statement of purpose for all these actors? If not, would it be
    ethical to have a different version for each group? If one is
    doing research on a stigmatised disease such as tuberculosis,
    should one tell community members that the research is on
    an infectious disease or on tuberculosis? Taking the first
    option protects the study subjects but is not entirely truthful.
    If the nature of the study is disclosed, it might have negative
    consequences on study subjects. Then again, it may not
    affect all study subjects in the same way. Men may feel
    minimal discrimination; women, especially young married
    women, may face severe discrimination. Some may be even
    forced to return to their natal homes.</p>

  <h4>Interaction between research methods and ethics</h4>
  <p>There is an interaction between research methods, ethics
    and the research setting. Research no longer need be
    conducted in a physical world; it can also be done in
    cyberspace. I am not going to deal with the cyberspace
    quandary, but address the questions that arise regarding
    the intricate link between choice and application of research
    method and ethics. A recent report on the ethical aspects of
    research on the Internet <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="AAAS: Ethical and legal aspects of human subjects research on the internet - A report of a workshop, June 10-11, 1999, American Academy for the Advancement of Science, Washington, D.C. http://www.aaas.org/spp/dspp/sfri/projects/intres/main/htm" id="3">(3)</a> identifies the survey research
    method as being relatively risk-free to participants as
    compared to more "intrusive" methods. Was the report
    categorising methods used for collecting qualitative data as
    'intrusive'? As a medical anthropologist mainly involved in
    qualitative health research, I found this disturbing, and my
    first reaction was to deny it. Upon reflection, I have to admit
    that there may be some truth in this observation.</p>
  <p>The researcher chooses a research method most likely to
    elicit the data needed to fulfil the objectives of the research. All research methods are likely to lead to ethical quandaries.
    In this article I focus on qualitative research methods.
    Researchers conducting qualitative research on sensitive
    topics such as alcohol or drug use, sexual behaviour or
    violence, routinely use repeat interviews, as it is important
    to build rapport. This repeated contact, essential for
    collecting data, may put the participant at risk of being
    identified and may violate confidentiality <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Langford, David R. Developing safety protocol in qualitative research involving battered women, Qualitative Health Research, 10(1):133-142. 2000" id="4">(4)</a>. Often, when
    in-depth repeat interviews are conducted, after rapport is
    established, participants reveal sensitive information
    because it provides catharsis. Sometimes later the subject
    may have second thoughts about having revealed as much
    as they did.</p>
  <p>In-depth interviews that are capable of eliciting sensitive
    information also arouse emotions and feelings that the
    interviewer has to be capable of handling. Time has to be
    given to respond to the participant's emotional needs. In
    research on topics such as sexual abuse or coercion the
    subject may need professional help. In a research project on
    sexual behaviours of street boys, the researchers came across
    instances of sexual coercion, but the researchers made a
    conscious decision not to probe into this unless the boy
    wanted to disclose this information voluntarily. The
    researchers felt that they could not cope with the emotions
    that it would bring out. This decision was made despite the
    fact that the researchers had links with mental health
    professionals since it was felt that the capacity of existing
    services might be inadequate. Nevertheless, the researchers
    ensured that those boys who had traumatic experiences,
    and needed counselling, received these services.</p>
  <p>During research the researcher becomes privy to
    information that directly affects others &mdash; the spouse, the
    family or the larger community. What should the researcher
    do if she finds out that a young woman has active
    tuberculosis? The researcher may decide that as the family
    members have been exposed to the infection already and
    they are not showing any signs of having contracted the
    disease, it may not be necessary to reveal this information,
    and the most important thing would be for the young woman
    to get prompt treatment. A slightly altered situation may call
    for a different decision. If the woman has a young
    malnourished, uninfected child who may get infected in the
    short duration that it takes for the drug to make the woman
    non-infectious, the researcher may have to advise the woman
    to take certain precautions that may reveal to other family
    members that she has an infectious disease.</p>
  <p>Even the choice of variable for analysis has major ethical
    implications. Should the researcher analyse a certain data
    set by caste, class, religion or ethnicity? What would the
    fall-out of this be? Similarly, there are many ethical questions
    regarding the dissemination of results. There is increasing
    pressure on the researcher to disseminate results quickly
    and to use the popular media. This can lead to distortion
    and misrepresentation. Most scientific findings are couched
    in caveats that are simply ignored when results are presented
    in the popular media. Researchers also have to be
    increasingly careful of what they present in small scientific
    gatherings, as snippets can be spread rapidly and out of
    context through the Internet <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Morse, J.M. The downside of dissemination, Qualitative Health Research, 2000; 10(3):291-292." id="5">(5)</a>.</p>
  <p>Indisputably, research findings must be communicated to
    the community where the research was conducted. Here
    again, the researcher has to be careful about what is said
    and how it is said, because communities are seldom
    homogeneous and the results will be interpreted according
    to existing cleavages in the community. Qualitative research
    that entails familiarity with community and the study
    participants may help to anticipate the risks to participants
    of divulging sensitive information <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lipson, J. Ethical issues in ethnography, in J. Morse (ed.), Critical issues in qualitative research methods, Thousand Oaks, CA : Sage, .333-355, 1994." id="6">(6)</a>.</p>
  <p>One way of keeping ethical issues in focus may be to
    include substantive discussion on ethical issues
    encountered in publications and papers. This would take
    the researcher beyond the formulaic sentence or two about
    informed consent to ethical questions that arose during the
    research and how these were tackled. In addition,
    consideration of ethical issues needs to be integrated into
    courses on research and research methods. Development of
    case studies that illustrate the complexities of applying ethical
    principles in different circumstances may be useful. Further,
    the participatory process and dialogue and debate that
    contributed to the development of the social science health
    research guidelines must be sustained.</p>
