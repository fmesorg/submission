				<h4>Abstract </h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Background:</strong> Since 1998, randomised trials in India funded by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have compared cervical cancer death rates among 224,929 women offered cervical screening to those among 138,624 women offered no screening whatsoever. To date, at least 254 women in unscreened control groups have died of cervical cancer. The United States Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) determined that the subjects in the studies were not given adequate information for the purpose of providing informed consent. The determinations of the OHRP contradict assurances given by other American medical and bioethical leaders.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Concerns:</strong> Defective scientific design required inadequate informed consent. US-funded measurements of death rates may have needlessly delayed development of indispensable, life-saving public health infrastructure. US-funded measurements of incidence and death rates proved to be scientifically irreproducible and unreliable. Predictably, nothing was learned from these measurements that was not already known. Statistical bias embedded in measurement of death rates yielded the absurd conclusion that Papanicolaou screening does not prevent cervical cancer, leading to a marketing campaign for a proprietary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening test unaffordable for the women among whom death rates had been measured. Inexplicably, measurements of death rates among unscreened women were continued even after the mortality benefit of screening had been confirmed. Quality management of NCI-funded visual screening (VIA) in Mumbai failed catastrophically, with unsettling implications for VIA conducted by those with less expertise.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusions:</strong> High-quality screening must be provided to all surviving unscreened women without further delay. US-based global health organisations should institutionalise a commitment to "improving health outcomes as rapidly as possible among as many people as possible." Those who suffered avoidable harm and death, as well as their families, should be promptly and fairly compensated. As another critic of these unfortunate studies concluded, "You can't let people die to show something you already know."

					Cervical screening is a secondary preventive intervention that reduces incidence rates and death rates of cervical cancer by detecting and treating high-risk "pre-cancerous" cervical lesions before these lesions progress to cancer. Since an increase in detection rates for these pre-cancerous lesions results in reductions of incidence rates and death rates of cervical cancer, it is generally accepted that increased detection rates constitute the best scientific proof of the value of any novel cervical screening approach <a class="reference" href="#thirtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jones BA, Davey DD. Quality management in gynecologic cytology using interlaboratory comparison. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000;124(5):672-81." id="30">(33)</a>. Measurements of incidence and death rates are consequently considered scientifically unnecessary in countries other than India. However, US-funded investigators claim that "evidence on disease burden in terms of incidence and mortality, particularly from randomised controlled trials, provide the most persuasive evidence for the effectiveness of a novel screening approach, such as a single round of screening, rather than results of the accuracy, detection rates of pre-cancerous lesions and model-based studies of screening tests which are unlikely to drive public health policy changes on their own" <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sankaranarayanan R, Nene BM, Shastri SS, Jayant K, Muwonge R, Malvi SG.

				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, the essential scientific novelty of the controversial US-funded studies in India has been to collect outcomes measurements (ie incidence rates and death rates of cervical cancer) in addition to process measurements (eg disease-detection rates), presumably to drive policy change in India. Others have suggested that people should not be used to demonstrate exactly how much death results from lack of medical care; besides being ethically problematic, such demonstrations are not particularly convincing to policy-makers, who already know what is going on <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Angell M. The SEARCH neonatal sepsis study: was it ethical? In: Lavery JV, Grady C, Wahl ER, Emanuel EJ, editors. Ethical issues in biomedical research: a casebook. New York, NY: Oxford University Press; 2007, pp. 114-15." id="7">(7)</a>. World Bank policy-makers approved the routine implementation of VIA screening services in Tamil Nadu in 2004 (34), several years before any US-funded measurements of death rates were available. If, as appears likely, there are no policy-makers who required these measurements, then there was no reason to collect such measurements in the first place.
				</p>
				<p>
					The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has determined that, among previously unscreened communities, Papanicolaou screening reduces cervical cancer rates by 60%&ndash;90% within three years of its introduction, and that these reductions in mortality and morbidity are "consistent and equally dramatic across populations" <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Since a state of equipoise does not exist regarding the benefits of cervical screening (compared to no screening), the creation and maintenance of unscreened control groups in the US-funded studies in India required inadequate informed consent. If, at any time during the past 15 years, the 138,624 women in the unscreened control groups had been told the simple truth that cervical screening would lower their risk of death from cancer, they would have left the control groups and sought screening on their own, thereby nullifying a scientifically defective experimental design. It is thus difficult to presume that the BMGF-funded studies <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sankaranarayanan R, Nene BM, Dinshaw KA, Mahe C, Jayant K, Shastri SS, Malvi SG, Chinoy R, Kelkar R, Budukh AM, Keskar V, Rajeshwarker R, Muwonge R, Kane S, Parkin DM, Chauhan MK, Desai S, Fontaniere B, Frappart L, Kothari A, Lucas E, Panse N; Osmanabad District Cervical Screening Study Group.

					Nevertheless, the puzzling redundancy of US-funded studies demonstrated that their measurements of incidence rates and death rates were scientifically irreproducible and unreliable.

In contrast, neither Papanicolaou smears, nor HC2<sup>&reg;</sup>, nor VIA reduced the incidence rates in Osmanabad (Table 2). Neither Papanicolaou smears nor VIA reduced the death rates in Osmanabad (Table 2). VIA reduced the death rates, but not the incidence rates, in Mumbai (Table 2).

				<h5>Inexplicably, measurements of death rates among unscreened women were continued even after the mortality benefit of screening had been confirmed </h5>

					By 2007, a single round of VIA screening in Tamil Nadu had reduced the incidence rates of cervical cancer by 25% and the death rates by 35% (Table 2). That result was scientifically pointless: by 1992, Indian investigators had determined that a single round of cervical screening would reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in India by 25% (50,51). Remarkably, US-funded investigators "plan to continue the follow-up of study population for cervical cancer incidence and mortality for several years to have information on long-term effect of the single intervention and to infer on screening intervals based on the extent of shrinkage of mortality reduction following single intervention" <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sankaranarayanan R, Esmy PO, Rajkumar R, Muwonge R, Swaminathan R, Shanthakumari S, Fayette JM, Cherian J.

To date, it is uncertain whether any screening has been offered to women in the unscreened control groups in Tamil Nadu.

Even if one were to assume that measurements of death rates and the existence of no-screening arms were justified in the first place, the no-screening arms in all three US-funded studies should have been closed after the demonstration of the mortality benefit of VIA had been documented in 2007.

				<h5>Quality management of NCI-funded VIA in Mumbai failed catastrophically, with unsettling implications for VIA conducted by those with less expertise </h5>
				<p>
					After three rounds of VIA screening in Mumbai, the number of deaths from cervical cancer was greater in the VIA screening arm than in the unscreened control group (Table 2). The failure of three rounds of VIA screening to lower either incidence or death rates in Mumbai, when a single round had reduced both incidence and mortality in Tamil Nadu, can be attributed to the extraordinarily poor quality of VIA in Mumbai, as reflected in the extraordinarily low rates of disease-detection using VIA documented there (Table 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					US-funded investigators acknowledge that "because visual tests, like cytology, are essentially subjective, quality control is an important issue...close monitoring of test-positivity and disease-detection rates are essential to maintain good standards of visual testing" <a class="reference" href="#fiftytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sankaranarayanan R, Gaffikin L, Jacob M, Sellors J, Robles S. A critical assessment of screening methods for cervical neoplasia. Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2005 May;89(Suppl 2):S4-S12." id="52">(52)</a>. These essential guidelines were inexplicably ignored in Mumbai. Disease-detection rates using VIA in the NCI-funded study in Mumbai were 40 times lower than those in another BMGF-funded study in Mumbai (a cross-sectional study of the three screening methods) <a class="reference" href="#fiftythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shastri SS, Dinshaw K, Amin G, Goswami S, Patil S, Chinoy R, Kane S, Kelkar R, Muwonge R, Mah&eacute; C, Ajit D, Sankaranarayanan R.

Remarkably, during the second round of screening in Mumbai, the disease-detection rate using VIA was lower than that for no-screening (Table 2). It is, therefore, uncertain whether any screening whatsoever took place in Mumbai. It appears that for 15 years, neither US-funded investigators nor the NCI Data Safety Monitoring Board noted the catastrophic failure of quality management of VIA in Mumbai. This has disturbing implications for real-world quality management of VIA in settings with lower levels of expertise.
