					Medical ethics is a path  illuminated by principles to guide members of the medical profession in their  dealings with each other and with their patients. Here, I concern myself with  the doctor-doctor relationship, which is under severe stress. I refer to  negative professional criticism of one's colleagues, a practice which damages  the profession and its reputation in the larger community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like other members of society, doctors are caught in the pursuit of money and  prestige. Like any other economic enterprise, medical practice too is  vulnerable to groupism and power struggles. As a result, doctors can knowingly  or unknowingly behave in a manner that detrimentally affects the position of  their colleagues. They must respond to this problem by reestablishing ethical  principles, because self-regulation is better than forced external controls  through laws.

				<h4>The medical scriptures</h4>
				<p>
					Various codes, both ancient and modern, have spoken on the  doctor-doctor relationship, identifying the duty to one's colleagues as well  one's duty to the community at large. Both ancient India and ancient Greece  speak in general terms of honour and moderation. "Your speech must be soft,  pleasant, virtuous, truthful, useful and moderate... must be mindful in  whatever you do," warns Sushruta Samhita. "Even when you are learned and  proficient, do not show off." Hippocrates' oath declares: "Now if I keep this  oath and break it not, may I enjoy honour, in my life and art, among all men  for all time; but if I transgress... may the opposite befall me." The World  Medical Association's Declaration of Geneva calls for all doctors to accept  that "My colleagues will be my brothers... I will maintain by all means in my  power, the honour and the noble traditions of medical profession." The code of  the Indian Medical Association is explicit: "The medical profession should  safeguard the public and itself against physicians deficient in moral character  or professional competence. Physicians should observe all laws, uphold the  dignity and honour of the profession and accept its self-imposed discipline.  They should expose without hesitation, the illegal or unethical conduct of  fellow members of the profession."

				<h4>Professional criticism</h4>
				<p>
					Positive criticism can be made in an environment which invites  criticism, when doctors seek peer review, when professional associations  appoint ombudsmen &mdash; all with the intention of analysing current medical  practice and using people's suggestions for self improvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is perfectly appropriate to quote a misdeed if the purpose is to change the  quality of professional practice. Sometimes, the context deserves a suitable  example &mdash; such as referring to the Lentin Commission's findings against  doctors' misdeeds. It is also necessary when one must object to unethical work,  such as reckless and unauthorised experiments in xeno-transplantation.  Criticism may be used to warn against possible misadventure, such as  criticising attempts at human cloning; or potentially dangerous human trials of  drugs for investigators' personal gains. It can be used to expose inhuman  trials, and the doctors and organisations associated with such activities, such  as the use of an anti-malarial drug to chemically cauterise the uterine  endometrium. Criticism of irrational practice is also essential, whether of  drug utilisation, prescriptions, investigations or other interventions. It may  also be necessary to publicly oppose irrational statements made by medical  professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these are attempts to change medical practice for the better. They do not  amount to negative criticism.
				</p>
				<p>
					In negative professional criticism, on the other hand, fault finding serves no  other purpose than to express ill will, affect the interests of others, and  tarnish the image of one's professional colleagues.
				</p>

				<h4>High risk situations</h4>
				<p>
					There are many situations in which doctors can get entrapped in  professional criticism. The following are some commonly noticed situations  where professional criticism is most likely to occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					One can be called to express one's views about a colleague or subordinate  during the course of a medical audit, or in a professional enquiry in a medical  board or because of a consumer complaint. During a peer review procedure &mdash;  editing a manuscript, conducting post examinations &mdash; one can be tempted to make  comments on one's colleagues. The doctor must take due care to express the  opinion confidentially, without a confrontationist attitude, and in a way that  does not malign the colleague. The purpose of expressing one's opinion is to  correct the problem, not enter into an enmity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another situation can arise when a patient comes to you for a second opinion or  specialist advice or for an alternative/complementary form of treatment. Such  visits are often misused to vent one's individual bias about the competence of  other practitioners or schools of treatment. Reserve such comments for  professional discussions in academic fora. The consumer has come to you to get  the best advice. Do not give him the worst of our profession &mdash; the habit of  criticising others. This will only result in the patient losing faith in the  profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					If there is a difference  of opinion over the diagnosis, or when the patient has been referred by a  general practitioner to a specialist, do not criticise the other professional  to establish your superiority. The patient has been referred to you because you  are believed to be more competent in that subject. Desist from using him or her  as a medium to spread criticism of fellow professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					When your patient sees another doctor during an emergency, or because you are  otherwise not available, do not criticise the other professional's decisions.  Be thankful to the doctor for having taken care of your case in your absence.
				</p>
				<p>
					An honest comment offered in good faith, to promote the patient's best  interests, may be justifiable. However, even this can become inappropriate  criticism. Think before you speak out loud. Think again before writing such  reports, ask a friend to review what you intend to report in writing to save  yourself from inadvertent criticism. Remember, comments which are gratuitous,  unsustainable and aim at undermining trust in a colleague's knowledge or skill  are unethical.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Positive steps</h4>
				<p>
					There is also a need to foster healthy criticism. Promote academic  debates among your peers. Utilise foras such as CMEs and medical journals to  air your professional opinions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>When you see negligence</h4>
				<p>
					It is your professional obligation to inform the appropriate authority  about a colleague whose professional conduct, fitness to practice and professional  performance appears to be deficient. Unfortunately, the majority of  professionals turn a Nelson's eye to such behaviour, even while they slander  their colleagues informally.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a patient comes to you with evidence of another doctor's serious medical  negligence, do not get caught in the web. Advise the patient to approach a  medical activist, voluntary group, professional organisation or medico-legal  expert for better guidance. Do not jump to conclusions and pass judgements  based on a one sided version of the story. Understand that you are not an  expert in these issues. Should you wish to become an advisor on such issues,  become an activist, pursue your interests of cleansing the profession and  getting justice to the needy. May God bless you.
				</p>
				<p>
					If negligence in the profession is continuous and on-going and you feel  strongly charged to correct the ills, nothing stops you from discharging your  social, ethical, moral and professional responsibility of reporting such  matters to the concerned for grievance redressal. You can become a party to  action in consumer health fora, the courts, or local health authorities. You  can bring the negligence to the knowledge of professional bodies and medical  councils and be actively involved without the fear of indulging in professional  criticism. It is always better that medical activists come from inside the  profession, for they understand the problems of medicine better.

				<h4>The right to health</h4>
				<p>
					On May 11, 2000, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
					adopted a General Comment on the right to the highest attainable standard
					of health.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The General Comment deals with a state's obligations to maintain the
					health of its population "to the highest attainable standard" by specifying
					the universal obligatory core components for every country's health system.
					Every state will be obliged to meet, or aim for, not only defined standards
					of availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of healthcare but
					also the essential prerequisites for health - a healthy environment, clean
					water, and adequate food and housing. Another important innovation will
					be the introduction of a system of benchmarks and indicators with which to
					monitor progress in the development of states' health services.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Article 12 of the Covenant says states recognise the right of everyone to
					the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental
					health. Parties agreed to take steps to reduce stillbirth and infant mortality
					rates, and to work towards the healthy development of the child, as well as
					improving all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene, the
					prevention, treatment and control of epidemics, and the creation of
					conditions which would assure medical services and medical attention in
					the event of sickness.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>States were obliged to guarantee that the right to health would be
					exercised without discrimination. They also had obligations to take
					deliberate, concrete and targeted steps toward the full realisation of the
					right to health.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Addressing violations of the right to health, the general comment said it
					was important to distinguish the inability from the unwillingness of a State
					to comply with the obligations of Article 12. If resource constraints
					rendered it impossible for a State to comply fully with its Covenant
					obligations, it had the burden of justifying that every effort had
					nevertheless been made to use all available resources at its disposal, the
					document stated.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The general comment recognised that implementation at the national
					level would vary from one State to another. It pointed out, however, that the
					Covenant clearly imposed a duty on each State to take whatever steps were
					necessary to ensure that everyone had access to health facilities, goods
					and services so that they could enjoy, as soon as possible, the highest
					attainable standard of physical and mental health.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>In pointing out the obligations of actors other than States parties, the
					document stated that the United Nations agencies and programmes,
					particularly the World Health Organization (WHO), were of particular
					importance. States parties, when formulating and implementing their right
					to health national strategies, should avail themselves of WHO's technical
					assistance and cooperation.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The Covenant has been ratified by 130 countries and is the leading legal
					source for the international human right to health. Every state signatory is
					required to make 'periodic reports' to the Committee at five year intervals.</em>
