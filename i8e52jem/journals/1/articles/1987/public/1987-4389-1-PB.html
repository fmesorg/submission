				<h4>Biodatas of writers in IME </h4>
				<p>
					I urge you to include the pertinent bio data of  authors who are published in <em>IME.</em> It is important to know the author's  background, training or experience before one can interpret her/his article or  opinion piece in the journal. Such information would allow the reader to put  the piece in perspective.
