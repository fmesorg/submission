							<strong>Access  to experimental drugs in terminal illness: ethical issues. Udo Schuklenk. 1998.  228 pp. $36.</strong> This is a discussion of the ethical dilemmas experienced by those  suffering from terminal illnesses who are denied legal access to experimental,  potentially lifesaving drugs and who are then pressured into clinical tests  designed to test and further the approval of the same drugs. The author argues  for the urgent need for an ethical and legal re-evaluation of the current drug  approval and drug testing process in most western countries.
