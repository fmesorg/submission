				<h4>Learning on a dying  patient</h4>
				<p>
					"A hospitalised patient has been receiving cardio-pulmonary resuscitation  for 20 minutes without any success, and is unlikely to survive the  resuscitation attempt. Is it appropriate for a house officer to insert a  femoral venous line for practice?"
				</p>

				<p>
					Thirty-four percent of the 238 house officers in a US teaching hospital who  were asked this question felt it was sometimes appropriate to do this  unnecessary and invasive procedure for the resident to get experience.  Twenty-six per cent had seen someone else do it; 16 per cent had done it  themselves.
				</p>

				<p>
					The authors describe a problem faced by teaching hospitals: service provision  must be combined with learning, including invasive procedures which can harm  patients when performed by novices. Many procedures are taught on animals and  models. Some are taught using bodies of recently-deceased patients, and on live  patients. The latter cases need informed consent from the next of kin.
				</p>

				<p>
					The authors point out that the tension between patients' and students'  interests is lessened when trainees are adequately supervised, when patients  give informed consent, and when only medically indicated procedures are  performed. "Inserting a femoral-vein catheter for practice in a person  undergoing CPR when the procedure is not medically indicated or when informed  consent has not been given is inconsistent with current standards of medical  ethics based on principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for  patients' autonomy."
				</p>

				<p>
					"Training programs should consider how aspects of clinical education may  unintentionally reinforce attitudes that can reduce patients to mere objects of  use in education."

				<h4>Transplants for people with Down's Syndrome</h4>
				<p>
					This is of relevance to Indian doctors facing similar ethical dilemmas treating  people with disabilities which could limit understanding of and compliance to  treatment.
				</p>

				<p>
					Though 40 per cent of people with Down's Syndrome have congenital heart  disease, and in the UK, many are potential candidates for heart transplants or  heart-lung transplants, the authors report that in 14 years of practice with  over 800 transplants, they received only one referral for a patient with Down's  syndrome. A questionnaire sent to other UK transplant centres revealed only two  other referrals.
				</p>

				<p>
					The perceptions: a transplant is "too much" for someone with Down's  syndrome, or the patient will be difficult to manage. Coexisting medical  problems may be contraindications to transplantation, and various possible  complications make the decision even more complex.
				</p>

				<p>
					Respondents also said that patients' ability to understand the transplant  process would influence the decision to accept them, though case reports of  renal transplants in Down's syndrome and assessment of children undergoing bone  marrow transplants report no problems with compliance.
				</p>

				<p>
					Transplant specialists and the public may be uncomfortable about allocating  limited donor organs to patients with Down's syndrome, especially if they are  considered "high risk" transplants. On the other hand, people with  Downs' syndrome may receive suboptimal medical care.

				<h4>Tubal nutrition for patients with dementia</h4>
				<p>
					One of the most difficult decisions relatives and doctors must make about  medical care for patients with dementia concerns artificial nutrition and  hydration. Family members cannot stand the thought of letting a loved one  "starve to death." Doctors don't know much about the ethical or legal  issues involved &ndash; or they are unconvinced by their arguments. It is often not  known what the person would want, and it is felt that feeding through a tube  will extend life, prevent aspiration pneumonia, and prevent suffering. Also,  there is the feeling that nutrition should never be withheld.
				</p>

				<p>
					The author cites various studies to argue that there is no evidence that tube  feeding prevents suffering or prolongs life. Patients with dementia tend to  pull out tubes, which means they have to be restrained, which is distressing.  Tubes don't necessarily prevent aspiration or extend the person's life. Nor are  hunger and thirst major issues for people with advanced dementia. Finally, both  the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Jewish traditions reject the use of  interventions which cause or prolong suffering. The author suggests that  gastrostomy tubes not be used routinely in patients with advanced dementia,  unless a family member requests it because they believe the patient would have  wanted it.

				<h4>Are US resident doctors employees, not students?</h4>
				<p>
					The US National Labor Relations Board's recent ruling that resident doctors are  employees under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act provoked an  exchange in the <em>NEJM</em>. Jordan Cohen argues that residents are basically  students who provide services as part of their education and get a stipend for  living expenses during their training. Yes, residents' working conditions have  been affected by the many and widespread changes in medical care:  "attending physicians have less time for teaching; fewer ancillary  personnel are available to assist with patient care; opportunities for  contemplation and study have dwindled; and the institutional commitment to  education is often obscured by a preoccupation with economic survival."  However, the adversarial character of labour-management relations is  irreconcilable with the bond of trust that must exist between teacher and  student, doctor and patient. Residents must use existing avenues of grievance  redressal Teaching hospitals must also convince their resident staff that their  institutions do listen and respond to their concerns.

				<p>
					The NLRB's ruling is  justified by Andrew Yacht who traces the history of the decision and points out  that public hospitals have long been allowed to form unions; the latest ruling  will give more than 50,000 residents in private hospitals in the US the right  to form unions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the current climate of "sweeping federal cuts in health care funding,  widespread hospital mergers, and local budgetary constraints", residents  are used to routinely provide basic services necessary for patient care.  Collective bargaining will enable residents to focus on skills of long-term  value. There is no reason to believe that the decision will interfere with the  time-honoured relationship between teacher and learner. Regular negotiations  and legally enforceable, collectively bargained agreements may actually prevent  strikes. They provide channels of communication for the resolution of problems  before a crisis is reached.
				</p>
				<p>
					"With the strength and privilege of collective bargaining, however, comes  collective responsibility ...No action... should ever be taken without full  comprehension of potential short-and long-term consequences for our patients  and our profession. Unions of residents must continue to reflect residents'  professionalism and dedication."

				<h4>Research ethics in developing countries</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial comments on a study in the journal, looking at the role of  antibiotics in reducing the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and the  incidence of HIV. Everyone in five of 10 Ugandan villages was given antibiotics  to reduce STDs; everyone in all 10 villages submitted to detailed medical and  sexual histories, as well as periodic lab tests for STDs and HIV. The  researchers found that antibiotics reduced the prevalence of other STDs, but  not the incidence of HIV-1. HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples was  associated with the viral load of the HIV positive partner.
				</p>

				<p>
					To get this information, several hundred people with HIV infection were  observed but not treated. Nor did investigators ensure that HIV-positive people  informed their partners. In the five 'treated' villages, people found to have  STDs were given antibiotics; in the 'untreated' villages, they were referred to  free government clinics.
				</p>

				<p>
					"Such a study could not have been performed in the United States, where it  would be expected that patients with HIV and other sexually transmitted  diseases would be treated. In addition, in most states it would be expected  that care givers would see that sero-negative partners were informed of their  special risk," writes the author.
				</p>

				<p>
					The researchers' reasons: participants were not being deprived of drugs that  they would normally receive. Also, it was the Ugandan government's policy not  to inform the partners of HIV positive people. "Many studies in developing  countries now use a similar rationale for observing subjects for outcomes that  could be prevented."
				</p>
				<p>
					The author points out  that proponents of such research defend it on the grounds that it is relevant  to the conditions of the research population. But does information from such  studies benefit the participating population? "As is so often the case,  the results will probably find their greatest application in the developed  world."
				</p>

				<p>
					The author explains why she chose to publish what she feels is an unethical  study: It had been approved by ethics committees in Uganda, the participating  universities and the National Institutes of Health. The subjects were reported  to have given oral informed consent (though it is difficult to say how clearly  the study was explained to them). It was also approved by peer reviewers and  the journal's staff. When two ethicists were asked for their opinions,  "One thought the study was not ethical; the other thought it was."  Hence the decision to publish, and invite further discussion on what is  obviously a very complex issue. "What is important is that the issues be  explored honestly, not defensively, and that the answers reflect moral  reasoning, rather than simply expediency."

				<h4>We'd rather be sponsored...</h4>
				<p>
					The Bangalore branch of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics conducted a survey on  its practice of funding its continuing medical education programmes through pharmaceutical  sponsorship to pay for out-of-town speakers, accommodation, a hall, food and  hand-outs, and to subsidise post-graduate students. "With the fierce  competition, tighter budgets, increasing costs and with the increase in the  number of CMEs organized every year, the pharmaceutical companies have become  more demanding", trying to control the subject of the CME.
				</p>

				<p>
					Of 170 delegates registered for the programme, 137 handed in their  questionnaires (most were post-graduate students, then practicing paediatricians,  and teachers), and of these only 46.7 per cent responded completely.  Eighty-seven per cent were in favour of pharmaceutical companies sponsoring  CMEs. Eighty-five per cent said Rs 1,000 was too much to charge for a two-day  CME; Rs 200-300 was okay for almost 70 per cent (the authors estimate that the  most modest meeting would cost a minimum of Rs 625 per person). Nor did the  respondents like the idea of contributing towards a corpus fund to fund CMEs,  or not having outside speakers.
