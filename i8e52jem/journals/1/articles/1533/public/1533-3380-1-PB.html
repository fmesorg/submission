					On May 8, 1980 the 33rd World Health Assembly formally declared that 'the world  and all its people have won freedom from small pox'. In May, 1996 the 49th  World Health Assembly adopted a resolution recommending that 'remaining stocks  of variola virus, including all smalIpox viruses, viral genomic DNA, clinical  specimens and other materials containing variola virus should be destroyed on  30June 1999...'

					The apparent eradication of smallpox  represents one of the most important and most valuable contributions of medicine  during the long centuries that the virus plagued humanity. Millions died or  were crippled by the disease and the fall of a number of societies including  both the Inca and Aztec civilizations are usually attributed to smallpox epidemics.
				</p>

				<h4>Who deserves the  credit?</h4>
				<p>
					In the west and in most formal western medical historical accounts, the major  credit for the eradication of smallpox is given to Edward Jenner, an English  physician. Such a conclusion is not correct, not even accurate with respect to  England. History records that almost 80 years before Jenner advocated  vaccination, Lady Mary Worthly Montague introduced into England inoculation  against the disease using direct material from smallpox lesions. Even her  introduction came very late in history. It is usually overlooked that  variolation (direct introduction of smallpox virus-containing material to  induce or increase immunity) antedated the birth of Christ and the Christian  era. The use of variolation antedated Montague and Jenner by several thousand  years.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Chinese applied powdered old pox crusts to  the nostrils. In India, the Brahmins inoculated dried pox crusts directly into  the skin. The Persians ingested dried pox crusts. In Europe, fluid from the  lesions of mild cases was injected directly into the skin. Jenner himself had  been a variolater for many years before he introduced vaccination (inoculation  of humans with the lesions of cowpox). Jenner should be - and is - given credit  for showing that cowpox vaccine could be used in series by arm to arm passage  and for publicising the use of cowpox (vaccination) as a safe and effective  alternative to smallpox inoculation (variolation).
				</p>
				<p>
					However, it should be emphasized that the  introduction of new approaches to the prevention or management or treatment of  a given disease involves nothing short of heroism on the part of the  experimental subjects who subject themselves to the new approach before its  safety and benefit. are known. If the treatment turns out to be safe and  effective, the physician who introduces it is afforded hero status. It the  treatment is ineffective or harmful it is erased from medical history with  little or no mention of those who were harmed. So it was with vaccination for  smallpox.
				</p>
				<p>
					We were able to obtain an early essay by  Jenner. This document identifies by name many of those subjects who were first  vaccinated and then exposed to material from smallpox lesions, i. e., who were  subjects of an experiment by Jenner whose hope was to prove the effectiveness  of vaccination. We will give the names of some of these heroes in a moment. It  is often forgotten that almost 200 years elapsed from the introduction of  vaccination to the eradication of smallpox. We will provide a description of  the masses of Indian villagers and public health workers who played a major  role in the eradication of smallpox in India. The ordinary villagers and the  public health workers were also heroes.
				</p>

				<h4>Epidemiology of  smallpox</h4>
				<p>
					Before describing these heroic deeds it is useful to review some aspects of the  biology and epidemiology of smallpox. One major mystery is the widely variable  mortality from naturally occurring smallpox. Here is an example. In British  India, between 1926 and 1930, there were 979,738 cases of smallpox with a  mortality of 42.3%. In contrast, between 1921 and 1930, 38 1,800 cases were reported in the United  States with a mortality of 0.9 %. The mechanism (s) for this huge difference is  usually stated to be variola major versus variola minor, a meaningless  distinction which, in fact, tells us nothing about the mechanism which would  explain the difference.
				</p>
				<p>
					The relevance here is that variolation in a  high mortality area might well be more dangerous than in a low mortality area.  It appears that major outbreaks of smallpox were usually accompanied by a sharp  increase in population corrected mortality. The reason (mechanisms) for this is  not known.
				</p>
				<p>
					It also appears that the mere processing of  smallpox material led to a decrease in virulence and in mortality. Although  accurate data are not available, this led to the widespread use of variolation,  particularly since accurate epidemiologic records of morbidity and mortality  from variolation were not kept.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also of interest that attenuation of a  variola virus isolated in Cologne, Germany in 1890 and subjected to serial  animal passage led to an attenuated smallpox vaccine that became the source for  clinically administered smallpox vaccines. Thus, ultimately, all vaccinations  became variolation, although the generic term 'vaccination' persists.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Unsung heroes in  Jenner's experiment</h4>
				<p>
					And now to a description of some of unsung heroes of the original experiments  of Edward Jenner. To qualify for inclusion in this series, a subject was not  only inoculated with vaccinia virus but was then deliberately injected with  material from patients with clinically diagnosed active smallpox.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first recorded experimental subject was an  adult woman only identified as 'Mrs. H. ' Her age is not known. She was  inoculated in 1778 after she gave a history of having had cowpox. Thus she was  exposed to smallpox without the protection of vaccination. In 1791 an adult  woman, Mary Barge, was vaccinated and then injected with smallpox. In 1792 an  adult woman, Sarah Portlock, was injected with smallpox, having stated she had  had cowpox 27 years previously. At the time she was deliberately inoculated  with smallpox she was nursing her infant.
				</p>
				<p>
					During 1792 an adult male, William Stichcomb,  was injected with cowpox followed by smallpox. During 1795 Joseph Merret and  William Smith, male adults, were put through this same sequence. Also in that  same year certain events occurred which provided insight into the mind of  Edward Jenner and his approach to his experimental subjects.. Eight women,  'paupers from the village of Tortworth', were put through the sequence. Only  one of the women is identified by name, Hester Wakely. Jenner was pleased that  none of these women contracted the disease since, as he noted, '... many of  these poor women were at the same time in a state of pregnancy. ' We presume  Jenner, describing the women as 'poor', was referring to their economic status  rather than to their bad luck at being selected as his experimental subjects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, in Jenner's time, prisoners, the poor  and children were frequently the uninformed ' subjects of medical experiments.  The same holds true today in our society (examples will be described in a  future paper).
				</p>
				<p>
					InJenner's experiments, children played a  part. We do not know which year this happened but Jenner exposed a five year  old, William Summers, a seven year old, J. Barge, another five year old, John  Baker and an eight year old, William Pead, to the sequence of cowpox and  smallpox inoculation. In 1796 an eight year old boy, James Phipps, was put  through the sequence. James Phipps became the subject of a myth that he was the  first human to be vaccinated with cowpox against smallpox. James Phipps  received his vaccination from material taken from a milkmaid. Sarah Nelmes (age  unknown) was also put through the sequence in 1796. The year of experimentation  was not given for three adult males, John Phillips, Thomas Pearce and James  Coles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Jenner could not have known in advance  that cowpox vaccination would be effective in preventing smallpox, the  conclusion is inescapable. He experimented on unknowing children, pregnant  women and the poor. Had prisoners been available to him they doubtless would  have been included. The experiment worked and Jenner became an immortal. The  subjects of his experiments, the true heroes 200 years ago, have remained  essentially unknown until now.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Unknown Indian heroes</h4>
				<p>
					Let us turn now to India for another series of unknown heroes.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the 19th century, smallpox was  unbelievably devastating in India. So prevalent was the disease that there  arose a saying: 'Never count children as permanent members of the family until  they have had and have recovered from smallpox. '
				</p>
				<p>
					When an effective vaccine became available  during the British occupation, the order of introduction of its use was  dictated by social position and class. Jennerian vaccine was first made  available to the rich and powerful among the British in India. Then the vaccine  was provided to Brahmins and to upper class Indians. Next came poor Europeans,  especially soldiers and sailors. Finally, it was the lower class Indians who  received effective and relatively safe vaccine. Often, interestingly, the  motive was to protect the British from exposure to the disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it should be emphasised that there  was a religious and social basis in India for using variolation rather than  vaccination. There were special practitioners known as 'tikadars' who practised  variolation, long before vaccination was discovered and became available. This  was a form of medical treatment sought after. and paid for by the people  themselves. There are no precise epidemiologic data but it has been estimated  that the mortality from immunologic variolation was between 0.5 to 1.5 percent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the absence of accurate data it will never  be known how many humans died because of the use of variolation rather than  vaccination. In 1831, W. Cameron, a British superintendent-general dubbed  variolation a 'murderous trade' and called its suppression 'indispensable to  the interests of humanity. ' It is not recorded that he personally intervened  to make safe vaccination freely available to the masses of Indian people.
				</p>
				<p>
					In any case, there are data to show that in  India, between 1868 and 1877, there were 1.44 million deaths. Between 1878 and  1887, there were an additional 1.46 million deaths. In the next decade, 1888-1897, mortality fell to 0.96 million, and between1898 and 1907, to 0.83  million, The fall in mortality may have been partially related to increasing  numbers of those immunised by more effective vaccination practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					At any rate, by 1971, despite extensive  programs of immunisation, it became increasingly apparent that mass vaccination  did not eliminate smallpox in India and, indeed, in the entire subcontinent of  Asia. It became apparent that a programme to eliminate smallpox must include  the elements of 'surveillance and containment'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beginning in 1973, a new strategy was  developed. In India, all health care workers, one week per month, would visit  every village in India and later every house to find cases. Villagers were  mobilised to help in finding cases and to enforce strict isolation of cases.  Teams of health care workers would visit every village and finally every house  during one week each month finding cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rigid control measures were adopted. House  guards were posted at each infected house on a twenty-four-hour a day  schedule. Vaccination teams were formed and all visitors were vaccinated.  Vaccination teams were organised and were made to live in each infected  village, searching and vaccinating in a wide radius around the village.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian model worked and produced dramatic  results. The Indian approach was adapted for use in Pakistan, Nepal and  Bangladesh. Two years later, using the approach of local vaccination, local  control and local surveillance, the last case of smallpox was reported in India  in June 1975. Similar success, using the same approach, was achieved in the  entire subcontinent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The public health workers and the villagers  throughout India were, of course, heroes in the eradication of smallpox. In  order to accomplish this, it was necessary to educate and energise broad masses  of Indian people.
				</p>
				<p>
					The education and energising of broad masses  can generally serve as a model for improving health care outcomes. A similar  approach, aimed at rheumatic fever, has been instituted in two French Caribbean  islands. A ten year programme targeted the public and health care workers for  education concerning rheumatic fever and its relation to previous begin  streptococcal infection. This has led to progressive decreases in the frequency  of rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic myocarditis.
				</p>

				<h4>'The unenlightened  poor'</h4>
				<p>
					There is a school of thought in Western medicine which holds that the poor and  the uneducated are not capable of exercising autonomy as patients due to their  unenlightened state. Indeed, some who hold such views have expressed the  opinion that medical care should be withheld from the impoverished in order to  control the problem of overpopulation. The Indian experience with smallpox and  the Caribbean experience with rheumatic fever reveal the error of these views.
				</p>
				<p>
					One major lesson to be derived from the  eradication of smallpox involves the indispensable role of patients and the  public in medical progress. It is lay people who provide the base for the  testing of new approaches in medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the new approach succeeds, all benefit.  When the new approach results in net harm, lay people are the ones left injured  or dead. Given the critically important role of non-physicians, it is  surprising that so little is done to recognise their indispensable contributions  in, say, clinical trials. The least that could be done is to define the risks  and benefits of a given approach as accurately as possible to individual  participants. They should be provided, when possible, with the opportunity to  participate or not participate. Society needs a system by which it acknowledges  the contribution of lay participants to medical advances.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although considerable progress has been made  since the time of Jenner in protecting the rights of non-physicians with  respect to participation in experiments, much remains to be done. For example,  an official agency of the US government states that experiments on patients in  the intensive care unit can be performed without the permission of the patient,  the patient's family or indeed of any non-physician. Whence comes this right  for physicians to act as demi-gods? Where is the evidence that intensive care  physicians or physician-investigators are particularly skilled at making  societal decisions in the intensive care unit? The government position simply  assumes that physicians are demi-gods or, at least, super human.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another major lesson of smallpox eradication  involves the contribution to medical care that can be provided by the poor and  uneducated. The 'poor' are not dehumanised and the 'uneducated' are not  uneducable. Rather, the evidence shows that mobilisation of broad segments of  society improves medical outcome for every one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mobilising and educating the poor and  handicapped touches on another important social issue. If the world is in fact  overpopulated, what is the justification for improving the quantity - the  lifespan - of masses of people?
				</p>
				<p>
					We, physicians, are not demi-gods. In western  society, there is growing support for measures to control population growth by  limiting medical care to specific population groups or, in some cases, by  ending life involuntarily. In one western country, approximately one percent of  all deaths occur because physicians or health care givers decide to end the  life of the patient - without consulting the patient, the family or any  designated societal group.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here, in the United States, we have a  candidate for presidency who advocates denial of health care individuals  attaining a certain age, having stated - paraphrasing - 'the old have a duty to  die. ' How will he behave when he reaches that particular age ? Will he  voluntarily exclude himself from medical treatment? A European group of  physicians indirectly advocates withholding medical care from the poor and the  uneducated, at least in particular circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem of dealing with a growing  overpopulation is, of course, not a 'medical' problem. It is not a question  which physicians are especially qualified to address.We should limit our role  as physicians to improving, as best we can,the quality of life oe the quantity  of life or both,of individual patients and groups of patients.We should concede  to society the authority to deal with broader and more complex issues like  excess population.
				</p>
				<p>
					In our roles as physicians, we should provide  care to the rich, the poor, and those in between. We should provide care to the  educated and the uneducated.
				</p>
				<p>
					We should provide care to the good, the bad ,  and the majority who are somewhere in between. If and when society decides we  should do otherwise, it will be a challenge for each of us to decide whether to  accept or reject that societal judgment in carrying out our professional duties.
				</p>
				<p>
					In closing, and returning to our subject of  smallpox, a cautionary note. Viruses are particularly resilient organisms.It is  not unthinkable that there may be a resurgence of the disease. In that event,  how will our principles - -societal and professional - - serve and guide us?
				</p>
				<p>
					We invite and welcome observations from as  many Indian colleagues as possible since your experience with many of these  questions is much closer and more direct than ours.
