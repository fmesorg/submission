				<h4>Trade  and our health</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial notes  that while developing countries' negotiations with the World Trade Organization  on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights will be important for  their access to essential drugs for life threatening diseases, the WTO's agreements  also affect national policies on a range of other health-related issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Some of the  proposals under negotiation regarding GATT indicate that developing countries  will be asked to open up health service markets to foreign competition...  experience in middle income countries indicates that foreign competition in  health service markets tends to worsen equity in financing and reduce access to  care for the poor."
				</p>
				<p>
					Health care will be  affected even without a liberalisation of trade in health services, as the WTO  discusses other services such as health insurance. As the US and the European  Union demand access to the insurance market in countries like India, the  experience of private insurance in Latin America teaches a lesson on how these  companies operate, selecting the healthiest people and dumping high-cost  patients on to the public sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					"After trade  related aspects of intellectual property rights and access to drugs, the next  major health issue on the agenda of the World Trade Organization may well arise  in the course of negotiations on trade in services. Health professionals need  to work with trade officials to minimise the risks to health equity from  liberalisation of services trade, and ensure that any resulting economic gains  in health related service sectors generate tangible public health benefits.

				<h4>In  favour of sex selection</h4>
				<p>
					In recent months, a  series of articles have appeared in ethics journals in the West, discussing the  ethics of sex selection. These essays are particularly important for those  following current developments in India on sex selective abortion and other sex  selection techniques. David McCarthy argues that that medically assisted sex  selection for non-medical reasons ought to be legal: it cannot do harm to  individual children, there is no evidence that it is affecting the sex ratio of  western societies. Sex selection is one form of reproductive autonomy, giving  parents the right to choose the child of a particular sex.

				<h4>It's  immoral but not necessarily illegal</h4>
				<p>
					J M Johnston examines  the law and practice on sex selective abortion in New Zealand, and also  examines the various arguments for and against the practice. Johnston suggests  that even if sex selective abortion is not based on son preference - with its  social consequences - its is morally wrong becase it encourages discrimination  based on sex. "...sex is not a morally appropriate differentiating factor  and allowing sex selective abortions will mean allowing abortions for trivial  and unjustifiably discriminatory reasons, thus undermining the serious and  strong reasons most women have for seeking the procedure." Interestingly,  Johnston concludes that while it is immoral, sex selective abortion must be tolerated  wherever abortion is available on demand.

				<h4>Does  appealing to ethics work?</h4>
				<p>
					This collection of  three essays discusses pharmaceutical companies' responsibilities to  provide drugs in poor countries at an affordable price. David Resnick  acknowledges the companies' responsibilities but argues that they are not  absolute. They "may be balanced against other obligations and  commitments". A company may also look at the business environment and the  scope for a profit. Developing country governments must respect international  trade agreements, and can work in cooperation with industry (rather than  confront it) to encourage it to act responsibly. Dan W Brock challenges the  arguments made by Resnick that companies have a social responsibility.  Separately, he suggests that even if such a social responsibility were  acknowledged, this would not go far towards meeting the drug needs of the  developing world, given that pharmaceutical companies' first responsibility is  to their stock-holders. The vast income inequalities between rich and  poor countries will force the latter to ignore patents if they are to provide  their people with essential drugs. In other words, poor countries would do  better if they confronted pharmaceutical companies, instead of appealed to  their social responsibilities. Norman Daniels also questions Resnick's appeal  to social responsibilites, proposing instead that the solution is to regulate  pharmaceutical companies, both internationally and domestically.

				<h4>Why  dangerous drugs are not banned</h4>
				<p>
					When a very profitable  drug is banned abroad for its adverse effects, interest groups in India resist  similar action here. This editorial illustrates the point with reference to the  drug cisapride. It refers to a report in the Indian Drug Review on a meeting  questioning the value of a ban on cisapride in India. The meeting argued that  the drug is cheap and cardiac adverse affects due to its use have not  been reported in this country - even while admitting that we have no system of  adverse drug reporting. "What the 'meeting of the minds' wants is simply  this: Cisapride has a market. The manufacturers cannot simply sacrifice it for  the safety of the consumers. So 'an Indian system of adverse drug reactions  should be evolved'. This may take years or even decades. The manufacturers will  have ample time to make their proits, never mind what happens to the hapless  consumers."

				<h4>Eugenic  abortion</h4>
				<p>
					This writer re-examines  the moral status of abortion in the context of current genetic research which  is likely to lead to a growth prenatal genetic testing. He concludes that  "secular philosophy should ultimately admit that the moral status of the  fetus is uncertain, and this uncertainty itself makes abortion morally  problematic. While this does not imply that abortion is always morally wrong or  that it should be legally prohibited, it does recommend a [moral] presumption  in favor of preserving fetal life except in special circumstances. A relevant  worry is that the rise of eugenic abortion gives new force to slippery slope  arguments that we will be led down a path to a situation where more fetuses are  terminated for relatively trivial reasons and that this will promote other bad  social consequences. This might justify legislative discouragement of certain  genetic interventions."

				<h4>Genetic  counselling</h4>
				<p>
					In a society where women  get blamed for infertility, for the sex of the child, or for any disability,  medical professionals must be thoughtful while disclosing genetic disorders to  the family. Women have faced discrimination from their husbands and in-laws  because of a genetic disorder in their children. The writers discuss  three cases which lead them to reassess the use of genetic counseling in India,  particularly in relation to the policy of disclosure of women's carrier  status. They suggest that the problem will become more serious with the  growth of genetic centres in the country, and the shortage of professionally  trained genetics counselors. Information provided during genetic counseling should  not lead the woman to feel guilty, or the family members to blame her. The  authors call for the development of ethical guidelines for genetic  counseling, which are appropriate for the Indian situation.
