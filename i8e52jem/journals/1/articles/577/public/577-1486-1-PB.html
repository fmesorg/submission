				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					The rapid spread of the novel influenza  virus of H1N1 swine origin led to widespread fear, panic and unrest among the  public and healthcare personnel. The pandemic not only tested the world's  health preparedness, but also brought up new ethical issues which need to be  addressed as soon as possible. This article highlights these issues and  suggests ethical answers to the same. The main areas that require attention are  the distribution of scarce resources, prioritisation of antiviral drugs and  vaccines, obligations of healthcare workers, and adequate dissemination and proper  communication of information related to the pandemic. It is of great importance  to plan in advance how to confront these issues in an ethical manner. This is  possible only if a comprehensive contingency plan is prepared with the  involvement of and in consultation with all the stakeholders concerned.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>

				<p>
					A novel influenza virus of swine  origin, A H1N1, emerged in Mexico in 2009 and spread rapidly, in a matter of  weeks, across multiple countries in the four major continents. The high  mortality among young Mexicans, coupled with the rapid spread of the virus  worldwide, revived memories of the devastating severe acute respiratory  syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003. Sensing the initial panic and in view of the  case fatality associated with the virus, many countries rushed to control the  epidemic. Some of the most drastic steps were taken by China and Hong Kong. The  former quarantined Canadian and Mexican nationals, while the latter sealed off  an entire hotel when the first case of H1N1 influenza (a Mexican guest) was  detected. All other guests and the staff were placed in quarantine [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacifi  c/8032157.stm]. Soon, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic  alert level to five and declared an orange alert. All healthcare workers were  required to wear N95 masks at work and have their temperature monitored twice  daily. Each patient could have only one visitor a day, and checkpoints were set  up at all hospital entrances. The movement of patients and healthcare workers  between hospitals was restricted, and rotations of junior doctors suspended.  Medical conferences were cancelled, leave for healthcare workers was curtailed,  and elective surgical procedures were postponed. Restrictions were placed on  overseas travel by hospital employees, and quarantine or viral screening was  made mandatory on their return from countries that had reported local  transmission. Additionally, travellers who had returned from Mexico were  quarantined for seven days. Schools were required to begin monitoring the  temperature of all students. Public health messages were disseminated on social  distancing, hand hygiene, and social responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					The widespread panic among the  public and growing healthcare burden raised several ethical problems, which  needed to be addressed ethically. Since influenza pandemics occur in  several waves lasting a year or two, thus requiring the response efforts to be  sustained for a prolonged period of time, it is necessary not only to address  the ethical issues which may arise during the planning, preparedness or  response phase, but also to understand that these problems need to be addressed  within an ethical framework.
				</p>
				<h5>Are ethical issues a priority during pandemics?</h5>
				<p>
					It is rightly said that a  good and fair decision is one which is based not only on sound scientific  reasoning, but also on the moral values and principles of society. If we fail  to incorporate ethical guidelines into our planning process or respond purely  scientifically to every issue, we may land up being unfair and appear  untrustworthy to the public. This has already been witnessed during the SARS  epidemic in Toronto <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singer P, Benatar SR, Bernstein M, Darr AS, Dickens BM, MacRae SK, Upshur REG, Shaul RZ. Ethics and SARS: lessons from Toronto. BMJ. 2003;327:1342&ndash;4." id="1">(1)</a>, where the healthcare organisations learned that the  costs of failing to address ethical concerns were severe. These costs included  lowering of the morale of hospital staff, confusion about roles and  responsibilities, stigmatisation of vulnerable communities and misinformation.
				</p>

				<h5>Role of ethics in planning for pandemic influenza</h5>

				<p>
					The incorporation of ethics into plans to counter pandemics  can be described as "the application of value judgments to science" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Perhac RM. Comparative risk assessment: where does the public fit in? Sci Technol Hum Val. 1998;23:221&ndash;41." id="2">(2)</a>. According to Thompson et al <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thompson AK, Faith K, Gibson JL, Upshur REG. Pandemic influenza preparedness: an ethical framework to guide decision-making. BMC Med Ethics. 2006;7:1&ndash;11." id="3">(3)</a>:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						While the ethics might have little to  contribute to understanding the mechanism of influenza virus transmission, it  can make a significant contribution to debates such as what levels of harm the  public are prepared to accept, how the burdens of negative outcomes should be  distributed across the population and whether or not more resources should be  invested in stockpiling antiviral medications.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Thompson et al <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thompson AK, Faith K, Gibson JL, Upshur REG. Pandemic influenza preparedness: an ethical framework to guide decision-making. BMC Med Ethics. 2006;7:1&ndash;11." id="3">(3)</a> and  Torda <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Torda A. Ethical issues in pandemic planning. Med J Aust. 2006 Nov 20;185(10 Suppl):S73&ndash;6." id="4">(4)</a> proposed an ethical framework to guide sound decision-making and fair  handling of ethical issues. They developed the framework after an extensive  review of the literature available on clinical and public health ethics,  following which they vetted it together with the stakeholders concerned. The  two important components of their framework were (i) ethical decision-making  processes, and (ii) ethical values.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the authors, the ethical process should  encompass the principles of openness and transparency with regard to the  decisions taken. Further, it should be scientifically and morally reasonable  and rational, include inputs from the stakeholders, be accountable during the  time of crisis, and be responsive to critical review and revisions. The important ethical values to be considered  are the duty to provide care, the principle of equity, privacy,  proportionality, solidarity, and mutual trust.
				</p>
				<p>
					Table 1 presents the main ethical issues related to influenza  pandemics, along with the authors' ethical, rational and scientific  prescriptions on how these issues should be addressed. The scientific view of  the importance of each of these ethical issues is reviewed in the subsequent  paragraphs.
				</p>
				<h5>Ethical issues pertaining to pandemic influenza </h5>
				<p>
					The following ethical issues pertaining to pandemic influenza need critical analysis and consideration.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The development of a comprehensive contingency plan/policy, involving the stakeholders and   public
					</li>
					<li>
						Schemes prioritising vaccination, antiviral therapy and personal protective devices
					</li>
					<li>
						Rationing of scarce resources for intensive care and acute care
					</li>
					<li>
						The obligation of healthcare workers to serve under stressful and risky conditions
					</li>
					<li>
						Adequate dissemination and communication of information
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<em>The contingency plan</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						The most important step towards  planning or preparing to meet an impending epidemic is the framing of a  "contingency plan" by the healthcare organisation. An important  component of a contingency plan consists of the objectives to be achieved in the  eventuality of a potential pandemic or before a pandemic emerges. This should  be followed by a step-wise, escalating response as the pandemic evolves. It has  been noted that though most organisations are able to design a contingency plan  to face an epidemic, their plans fail to meet the institutional or public  needs. This is because most of the ethical issues concerning the population  likely to be affected are either not foreseen or defined clearly, or the  decision-making process is marked by the absence of healthy public engagement  and discussion. In his critical analysis of the contingency plans of three  nations (the UK, the USA and Canada) on how to face pandemics, Kotalik <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kotalik J. Preparing for an influenza pandemic: ethical issues. Bioethics. 2005 Aug;19(4):422&ndash;31." id="5">(5)</a> found similar shortcomings. The plans lacked proper and clear guidelines on how  to address ethical issues pertaining to the pandemic. Most plans fail to work  in an emergency situation as they are highly scientific and are not backed by  moral values.
					</p>
					<p>
						The WHO and UK pandemic contingency plans <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Pandemic influenza preparedness: sharing of influenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefits [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2011 May 5 [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http:www.//apps.who.int/gb/pip/." id="6">(6</a>, <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Health Service. Pandemic flu: UK heath departments' UK influenza pandemic contingency plan [Internet]. London: NHS; 2005 Oct [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http//www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu" id="7">7)</a> stress that  the primary objectives of an effective plan must be to save lives, reduce the  health impact of a pandemic, and minimise the disruption of health and other  essential services. Also essential for an effective contingency plan are a  strong leadership, inter- and intra-organisational communication and  coordination, as well as clear lines of accountability. Advance planning is  also a must, not only to establish but also to rehearse contingency  arrangements and to identify and address gaps in preparation.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>Schemes prioritising vaccination,  antiviral therapy and personal protective devices</em>
					</li>

					<p>
						Pharmaceutical interventions like vaccines and antiviral  therapy are required to mitigate the impact of an influenza epidemic. Until the  new virus strain is isolated or characterised, stockpiling of vaccine is not  possible. Once the production of the vaccine is under way, batches of the  vaccine can become available only in a gradual fashion. A recent WHO report  estimated that the global production capacity for current influenza vaccines is  350 million doses per year, which is clearly insufficient for supplying  vaccines to all countries. (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_EPR_GIP_2006_1/en/index.html0).  As only a limited quantity of vaccine may be available to the developing  nations, either due to the cost factor or the limited resources available in  these countries for mass production, the question arises as to who should get  the vaccine during the pandemic. How are the large-scale logistics to be  managed and from where are the human resources to be garnered to implement a  mass vaccination programme? Also considering the costing of antiviral drugs,  the question arises as to how much should be stockpiled or kept as a safety  stock. It has been suggested that a stockpile to cater to around 25% of the  target population must be maintained and that the contingency plans should  clearly spell out details regarding its procurement and storage, in addition to  specifying the budgetary constraints.
					</p>
					<p>
						As per the guidelines issued by  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the 2004&ndash;05 pandemic <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Use of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP), 2009. MMWR 2009:58(RR10):1&ndash;8." id="8">(8)</a>, the administration of the vaccine should beprioritised in the following  order:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Pregnant  women
						</li>
						<li>
							People  who live with or have regular contact with infants below 6 months of age
						</li>
						<li>
							Healthcare  and emergency medical services personnel
						</li>
						<li>
							Children  and young adults between ages 6 months and 24 years
						</li>
						<li>
							Those with existing  health conditions which put them at increased risk of complication
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						It is important to weigh the disadvantages against advantages  while considering a mass vaccination programme. This would include taking into  account factors such as the implementation costs of such a programme and the  benefits of non-pharmacological interventions, eg isolation, quarantine and personal  hygiene. Antiviral drugs are the other mainstay of treatment during pandemics  and their use should be prioritised, like that of vaccines, in the case of the  development of early symptoms among various high-risk groups.
					</p>
					<p>
						During an influenza pandemic, additional essential medical  supplies, such as gloves, masks, syringes, antipyretics and antimicrobial  agents, are required. There is a shortage of these supplies in healthcare  facilities in the developing countries, even in non-emergency situations. This  shortage can hamper the provision of adequate medical care to patients with  pandemic influenza. In addition, it is necessary to have basic personal  protective equipment, such as disposable gloves and surgical masks, for  healthcare workers. An estimate of the  quantity of essential supplies needed, the estimated costs of procurement, a  list of local distributors/suppliers, and the mechanism for early procurement  of the supplies should be detailed in the contingency plan. The decisions on  the quantity to be purchased should be rationalised on the basis of the gap  between the existing resources and the ideal requirement at the time of a  pandemic; and consideration should also be given to the costs involved, ie the  cost in terms of human suffering or loss of life. A certain quantity of the  essential supplies should be purchased and kept as safety stock in the disaster  cabinets, for use by healthcare workers during an emergency. The policy-makers  should issue appropriate and fair guidelines on the meticulous and judicious  use of personal protective equipment and other supplies. The guidelines should  give due priority to essential healthcare workers, other workers who provide  life-saving services, as well as critical services necessary for society to  function as normally as possible. The emphasis must shift from the individual  to the general population.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>Rationing of scarce resources for  intensive care and acute care</em>
					</li>

					<p>
						Healthcare organisations face a disaster alert following the  outbreak of a pandemic, if it is severe, as an extremely large number of sick  people may require care at the same time. The vital question is: how to provide  the best care to all. The principle of equity states that all patients have an  equal claim to healthcare, not only under normal circumstances, but under all  circumstances. If the chances of  survival of one out of two severely sick patients are poor, which of them is to  receive care in the ICU? What quantity of the limited but costly resources,  such as ventilators, needs to be purchased? To what extent does the capacity of  the hospital, in terms of beds, need to be augmented?
					</p>
					<p>
						Oshitani et al <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Oshitani H, Kamigaki T, Suzuki A. Major issues and challenges of influenza pandemic preparedness in developing countries. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008;14(6):875&ndash;80." id="9">(9)</a> reported that with an incidence rate of  35%, up to 79.1% of hospital beds are required for patients with pandemic  influenza in low-income countries In countries like Bangladesh and Nepal, more  than 100% of beds would be required for patients with pandemic influenza, even  at an incidence rate of 15%.
					</p>

					<p>
						To decide upon how to allocate scarce resources and provide  equal access to healthcare facilities, the approaches advocated in the several  allocation theories may be considered.  These are the libertarian, utilitarian, egalitarian and communitarian  approaches <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beauchamp TL, Childress JF. Principles of biomedical ethics. 3rd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press; 1994." id="10">(10)</a>. The libertarian view is that allocation is best left to the  marketplace, while according to the egalitarian approach, which is based on the  principle of equity, everyone should receive the same treatment, the same  amount of treatment and the same opportunity to access the benefits provided.  The communitarian approach emphasises consensus among the members of the  community on the goals and values they wish to achieve and uphold. The author,  however, suggests the adoption of a utilitarian approach, which advocates a  proper distribution of resources in order to achieve the best outcomes or  greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. Patients coming to  hospitals can be medically prioritised into those who will probably live only  with treatment, those who will probably live without treatment and those who  will probably die with treatment.
					</p>
					<p>
						Decisions on the provision of rationalised care may also be  made on the basis of the quality adjusted life years technique. An ethically  reasonable approach would be to reject those patients who might survive, but  who would spend a long time in the intensive care unit.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the planning process, steps must be taken to allocate  an amount of the budget that has been fixed in advance for the purchase of  vital or life-saving equipment. The amount fixed should be based on the number  of patients who are likely to require acute/critical care, the population the  hospital caters to and the level of care the hospital is expected to provide.  It is also necessary to mobilise the staff and ensure that vital equipment is  available for use by rescheduling surgeries / procedures fixed earlier to a  later date. Further, the situation must be assessed repeatedly, on a day-to-day  basis. These measures should be clearly spelt out in the contingency plan. Most  importantly, these decisions or policies should involve and draw upon inputs  from the community health officials, healthcare workers and the public, and be  put across in a clear, transparent, fair and systematic manner.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>The obligation of healthcare workers to  serve under stressful and risky conditions</em>
					</li>

					<p>
						Kotalik <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kotalik J. Preparing for an influenza pandemic: ethical issues. Bioethics. 2005 Aug;19(4):422&ndash;31." id="5">(5)</a> rightly asserts that a successful response to an  influenza pandemic depends greatly on the attitudes, skills and efforts of  healthcare workers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr Joanna Tse Yuenman, a 35-year-old physician specialising  in respiratory diseases, was the first doctor working in a public hospital to  die of SARS during the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic [<a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200305/23/eng20030523_117091.shtml" target="_blank">http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200305/23/eng20030523_117091.shtml</a>]. Her death generated a great outpouring of  public emotion in Hong Kong. Two  quotes <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gardiner D. Are you coming to work during pandemic flu? Anaesthesia. 2008 Aug;63(8):803&ndash;5." id="11">(11)</a> that express the sentiments regarding her sacrifice are, "As a  doctor, her duty was to save lives,'' and, "...the dedication and  professionalism of the front-line medical personnel went far beyond the simple  duties of a job."
					</p>
					<p>
						Healthcare workers are  expected to work outside their normal scope of practice, put in extra hours,  fill in for workers who are ill and be prepared to move where their services  are most needed. What are the healthcare organisation's obligations towards  them? Is it professionally right for healthcare workers to go home and leave  their colleagues to cope? Should there be legal provisions to force the staff  to work during a pandemic?
					</p>
					<p>
						Healthcare organisations should ensure the safety of their  workers and protect them. They should support their staff during a  pandemic. The healthcare workers should  be kept informed about the situation and what is expected of them. They should  be encouraged to formulate their responses, which should then be discussed in  an open forum. Priority-based prophylaxis/vaccination should be administered  and safety measures, such as the provision of personal protective equipment,  should be taken. This helps to reduce staff absenteeism and prevents healthcare  workers from becoming vectors of the infection. Though the extent to which  healthcare workers are obliged to risk their lives to deliver clinical care is  difficult to quantify, ethically, it must be made clear to them that they  should discharge their duty unless it conflicts with one or more of their other  moral duties, i.e. if they do not have a stronger, more compelling reason to  absent themselves from duty, then they have an obligation to risk their lives  and come to work.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>Adequate dissemination and communication  of information</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						The plan for dealing with an influenza pandemic should be  communicated to the government authorities at various levels and to the related  institutions. Attempts should be made to disseminate the provisions of the plan  in a systematic manner.
					</p>
					<p>
						Who defines and controls the protocol for communicating  information on the pandemic?
					</p>
					<p>
						How is the information disseminated? What measures are being taken to inform the  population likely to be affected? Are any mechanisms in place for the redressal  of complaints or grievances, and how are decisions on such matters taken and  communicated?
					</p>
					<p>
						The plan of the healthcare organisation should clearly  specify the line of authority and define a single command which would serve as  the channel for the communication of all information. This may entail identifying and appointing  designated nodal officers for pandemic control and surveillance.
					</p>
				</ol>
				<p>
					There should be mechanisms to ensure the proper collection  and compilation of the necessary guidelines, as well as the systematic issuance  of the guidelines to all the stakeholders concerned. No miscommunication, duplication  or delay should be allowed in the percolation of the important information.  Efforts should be made to promptly involve and notify the sections of the  public likely to be affected by the pandemic. In this context, utilising the  services of a dedicated team of the community health officials of the  organisation or help from NGOs would be useful, as would be targeted public  health education and awareness campaigns. Such campaigns would minimise the  spread of panic, while the public's involvement and support would help in  addressing many ethical issues in a more fair and transparent manner. A  mechanism to ensure accountability must be put in place so that the process of  decision-making is ethical throughout the crisis. Further, scope should be  given for the elaboration and refinement of the contingency plans on the basis  of inputs from the stakeholders, government guidelines, public complaints and  suggestions.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>

				<p>
					Influenza pandemics pose an ever-growing threat and in the  near future, the morbidity and mortality associated with them might greatly  increase among all age groups. Our healthcare system needs to gear up for this  challenge and plan strategic measures well in advance. Several ethical issues  of a complex nature may crop up and hamper healthcare efforts or undermine  public trust, but if we adopt an ethical framework for decision-making in our  plans, our efforts to control the pandemic may well make a considerable impact.  The aim of this article has been to highlight the importance of an ethical  process while planning for the eventuality of a pandemic, and to outline and  find ways of addressing the various ethical problems which may come up during  the preparedness or response phase of an influenza pandemic.
