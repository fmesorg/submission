				<h4>Contributions to Medical  Ethics welcome</h4>
				<p>
					We welcome contributions  to this newsletter on any aspect of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Personal dilemmas,  solutions to difficult ethical problems, constructive criticism based on your  experiences (with other medical practitioners, laboratories, imaging centres),  current practices that need correction and your suggestions on how improvements  can be made will help many of us.
				</p>
				<p>
					As long as our approach  is constructive, we should not fear controversy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst we'd be grateful  for contributions typed with double spacing on one side of A4
				</p>
				<p>
					sheets, we will use  essays, letters and other items in legible handwriting as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please address the  envelope to Dr. S. K. Pandya, Department of Neurosurgery, K. E. M. Hospital,  Parel, Bombay 4000 12.
