					I disagree with Dr Pandya that our website
					(<a href="http://www.drmalpani.com/" target="_blank">www.DrMalpani.com</a>) represents an advertisement. We
					have put up our website to educate infertile patients
					about what can be done to help them, and the full text of our
					book, Getting Pregnant &ndash; A Guide for the Infertile Couple
					(over 400 pages), is online on our website. This is an
					educational service, and we receive over 10 emails from
					infertile patients from all over world daily, which we answer
					(free of charge) to educate them about their problem and its
					solutions. The internet represents a potent medium by which
					doctors can educate their patients <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ferguson T. Digital doctoring: opportunities and challenges in electronic patient-physician communication [editorial]. JAMA 1998; 280: 1261-1262" id="1">(1)</a>, and many authorities
					are now exhorting doctors to put up their own websites <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Peters R, Sikorski R. Building your own: a physician's guide to creating a website. JAMA.1998; 280: 1365-1366." id="2">(2)</a>,
					so that their patients can have access to reliable and accurate
					information which they can trust.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though our website is not an advertisement, I feel
					that doctors should, in fact, be allowed to advertise, and I
					would like to take this opportunity to elaborate my views,
					which may be considered to be unconventional. There is no
					doubt that for most doctors, advertising is a dirty word, but
					I feel this is a hangover from the past.
				</p>
				<p>
					How are doctors who have just started practice going to
					get patients ? How will patients know of their skills and their
					expertise ? Many young professionals, who have spent long
					years to qualify and taken loans to start practice, simply
					cannot afford to sit back and starve till patients arrive on
					their doorstep. This is why new doctors have to resort to
					unethical practices like cuts and kick-backs today &ndash; many of
					which have been institutionalised by their seniors. I think it
					is far more honest to allow them to inform patients of their
					skills by allowing them to advertise &ndash; at least this is open
					and transparent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact is that the status quo is in favour of senior doctors
					&ndash; those who have an established reputation, with many
					hospital attachments and lots of patients. These same
					doctors are the " medical establishment", which sets the
					rules for all doctors. They will do their best to maintain the
					status quo and prohibit advertising &ndash; not to protect patients,
					as they claim, but simply to protect their practice, by putting
					new doctors at a major disadvantage, and protecting their
					own interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandya states that "Most codes on ethics in medicine
					prohibit advertising by doctors." Unfortunately, Dr Pandya
					has not kept himself up to date. The original codes were
					developed centuries ago, and they need to be updated, as
					required by the demands of changing times. The US Supreme
					Court has ruled that professional advertising, as commercial
					speech, is entitled to First Amendment protection (the
					guarantee of the right of free speech). The Court held that
					not allowing doctors to advertise was unfair to them &ndash; and
					also unfair to patients, who need access to information on
					doctors, so they can select the best for themselves. Today, the AMA has promulgated guidelines for ethical advertising
					by physicians, and these guidelines permit physician
					advertising provided it is not false, deceptive or fraudulent.
					To keep readers abreast of new medical guidelines
					worldwide, here is what the Council of the College of
					Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta has to say about
					physician advertising in its Code of Ethics <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Physician Advertising. The Council of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta . http://www.cpsa.ab.ca/policyguidelines/ advertising.html January 2000." id="3">(3)</a>. " The
					Counci...believes that clear and accurate information about
					physician services benefits all parties in the health care
					system. "Advertising falls within the definition of "freedom
					of expression", and any constraints to this freedom should
					be minimal and reasonable. " They clearly specify what is
					acceptable, and state that "Advertising is just one of the
					professional activities subject to the Code of Ethics.".
				</p>
				<p>
					It is true that advertising has a downside. For one,
					advertising may cause doctors to start treating their patients
					as clients or customers, rather than as patients &ndash; and this is
					a shame. For another, some ads will be dishonest, but at
					least they will be in black and white, where they can be
					refuted and debated &ndash; and a doctor making false claims taken
					to task. This is far better than making tall claims within the
					four walls of a clinic and taking the patient for a ride.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandya writes, "Were physicians to advertise, patients
					run the risk of being lured to the one with the fanciest media
					coverage rather than to the most competent and
					experienced." Dr Pandya has conveniently assumed that
					the most experienced physicians are the most competent.
					This is obviously unfair &ndash; and untrue. Most senior physicians
					expect that patients should come to them because of their
					"experience" &ndash; but they are often the ones with the most
					outdated knowledge and technical skills. Younger doctors
					who have trained overseas at centres of excellence and
					developed specialised areas of expertise may often be able
					to do a far better job than senior doctors, and especially
					since medical technology changes so rapidly, it's hard for
					senior doctors to keep abreast of all sub-specialities.
					However, how many will actually refer a patient to their junior
					colleague who may have specialised in that field?
				</p>
				<p>
					I respect Dr Pandya, and do not expect him to agree with
					all my views, but he should allow me the liberty of having
					my own viewpoint. He says we "pander to patients who
					want to have boys". All infertility specialists pander to
					patients who want to have babies. You might argue that
					infertility treatment itself should be banned because of
					overpopulation. I have explained my views at great length
					in a previous issue of Issues in Medical Ethics <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malpani A. Why I do PGD for sex selection. Issues in Medical Ethics 1998; 6 (2): 54." id="4">(4)</a>, as to
					why I feel pre-conceptional sex selection is ethically
					acceptable, and this view has been endorsed by others as
					well. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Savulescu J and Dahl E. Sex selection and preimplantation diagnosis: A response to the Ethics Committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Hum. Reprod. 2000; 15: 1879- 1880." id="5">(5)</a> I do understand that my stance may not be
					"politically correct" and will not win me any friends &ndash; but at
					least I have the courage of my convictions, and am willing
					to stand by them in public. Isn't this far better than the
					majority of doctors who will denounce sex determination in
					public &ndash; and then perform it in private for their own patients,
					on the sly?
				</p>
				<p>
					I am still not clear as to what Dr Pandya finds objectionable
					about the press reports which we have reproduced on our
					website. All he has done is merely quote them, but has not
					stated what is wrong with them. Are these false? Incorrect ?
					Wrong ? What is the point he is trying to make ?
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandya talks pejoratively of doctors who would like to
					"attract such tourists and their lucre." Why should he object
					to doctors treating rich patients from overseas? They can
					pay for their treatment &ndash; and this is additional foreign
					exchange earned for the country. Isn't this far better than
					Indian doctors who contribute to the brain drain by settling
					abroad because of the attractive salary and "lucre" offered
					by foreign hospitals? And isn't it better than Indian patients
					flying to the US to take medical treatment there?
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Pandya is worried about the "scores of charlatans and
					quacks" who will advertise. The fact is that these quacks do
					advertise daily in the media in any case &ndash; as evidenced by
					the numerous ads by weight loss clinics and homeopaths,
					to say nothing of the sexologists in the classifieds. Allowing
					reputed and reliable doctors to advertise will help to enlighten
					and educate patients &ndash; and an excellent example of such
					educational advertisements are the ads placed by the
					Cleveland Clinic, USA in The Times of India.
				</p>
				<p>
					How do patients select doctors in India today? Usually
					either by reputation or referral, and I am sure Dr Pandya
					himself with agree with me that neither of these are reliable
					criteria. Dr Pandya is worried that the Indian patient is na&iuml;ve
					and simple &ndash; but this is exactly what we are trying to change
					with our efforts at patient education through our free public
					health library, HELP &ndash; the Health Education Library for
					People, and our website, so that patients can be empowered
					with the information they need to get the best possible
					medical care, in partnership with their doctor.
