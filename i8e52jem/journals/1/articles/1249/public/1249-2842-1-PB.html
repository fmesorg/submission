					Mumbai's JJ Hospital and Grant Medical College, two
					of the oldest and most prestigious medical
					institutions in the country, were in the news
					recently, but for the wrong reasons &mdash; the 'leakage' of exam
					papers for the final year medical exam. Apparently a few
					hours before the commencement of a theory examination,
					the paper was found with a student in a photocopy shop on
					the hospital campus. Somebody blew the whistle and the
					student confessed to have obtained the paper from a peon,
					who in turn led the police to none other than a professor of
					forensic medicine &mdash; who also was the chief invigilator for
					the examination. This gentleman had once officiated as the
					assistant dean of the hospital. Soon, more names started
					tumbling out from what seemed to be an organised ring of
					doctors, ex-students living in the hostels, and intermediaries
					like peons who would deliver the paper to students for a
					price.

					It may have been a bit shocking to the common person to
					read about all this in their daily newspapers. But to those in
					the know about contemporary medical examinations &mdash;
					including may of our readers &mdash; it must not have come as a
					big surprise. What may have been a little different this time
					was that there seemed to be an effort to track the culprits
					and book them. It remains to be seen how far this will go, for
					often in the past such investigations have withered away
					and many of the accused have been successfully
					rehabilitated in the profession. As for the medical community
					including academic bodies they maintained their customary
					silence.

					Those of us who have had something to do with medical
					examinations either as candidates, examiners or close
					observers have known for years that subtle or obvious
					subversion of the process is not a new phenomenon. The JJ
					case is probably an extreme example, but subtler forms of
					corruption in which certain candidates are favoured due to
					their medical, political or monetary connections, are very
					well known. It would not be an exaggeration to say that
					almost every examiner for a medical examination receives
					the 'numbers' of candidates from his professional
					colleagues. What that examiner chooses to do with these
					numbers may vary but there have been umpteen examples
					of children of either doctors or politicians benefiting from
					favouritism in medical exams. In fact in the early '80s, a chief
					minister of Maharashtra had to resign after he was found to
					have influenced an examiner to tamper with the marks
					obtained by his daughter in a postgraduate medical
					examination in Mumbai University.

				<p>
					There is a rather cynical (or practical?) view on this
					phenomenon, which states that all this is just a reflection of
					the deteriorating values in society. Also that this happens
					more often in medical exams (and is reported more often in
					the press), as the stakes involved are high and that they're often are high profile students involved. This is to an extent
					true. But such subversion of the examination process in
					medical education and the fact that over the years it has
					been 'tolerated' by the profession to the point of complicity
					has had a far-reaching impact on the development of a
					medical student. The impression that deceit and corruption
					are 'routine' and the profession's rather tacit acceptance of
					these tendencies shape the ethical mindset of a young
					medical student. In the transition from a student to a
					practitioner these impressions remain with the result that
					the acceptance of unethical medical practices is in a sense
					'easier'. Compromises with unethical acts in medical
					examinations and medical education it seems are acceptable
					to the profession. Then as it must be when it comes to the
					practice of medicine. Let's say the young doctor quickly
					realises that there is no peer pressure to be honest and
					ethical.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development of a medical professional's ethical stance
					is surely an outcome of many factors. But those struggling
					to promote ethics in the practice of medicine could do well
					to sometimes turn their attention to what is happening in
					our medical colleges where the minds of our future doctors
					are being shaped. With the overall retreat of 'idealism' and
					'ideology' from campuses and with the increased acceptance
					of money as a determinant of success in the profession this
					is now a complex task. For one it could involve projecting
					alternative models of 'success' to our younger colleagues.
					Surely not an easy job in the era of dominance of style over
					substance.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the paper leak scam and other such incidents
					exemplary punishment for the culprits is still necessary.
					Rather than waiting for state agencies like the police to
					complete their investigation (if it happens at all) medical
					organizations could initiate steps to isolate those under a
					cloud and reiterate clearly and loudly their opposition to
					such acts.
