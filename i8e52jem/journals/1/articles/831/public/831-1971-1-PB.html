				<h4>What  do we gain from medical conferences?</h4>
				<p>
					Almost every alternate day an update, workshop or conference on some aspect of  medical science is taking place at the local, zonal or national level. 'The  purpose of an organization is to facilitate the communication between  individuals of a common profession with the purpose of advancing their  knowledge through the free interchange of their mutual experiences,  observations, philosophies and conclusions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baker WH. Medical meetings: the real value. Bulletin of the Am Coll Surg 2001;86:13-18." id="1">(1)</a>.' Obviously, reading a journal  at home does not educate in the same way as conference discussions could.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  in conferences today, the most important criterion for the medical association  or society hosting the conference seems to be the venue-it should be easily  accessible, have good hotels for the delegates and have some tourist spots.  Doctors also get to meet their colleagues and discuss professional problems,  financial issues, malpractice hassles, or even life stories. Many of the  doctors attend these conferences because their organisation sponsors them. The  organiser wants to make the conference 'a hit' towards contesting for the post  of 'President' or 'Secretary' of the governing council of the association.  Pharmaceutical companies have stalls with programmes for accompanying spouses  and children and sponsor delegate kits, lavish banquets and entertainment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Usually,  200-300 papers are presented in various sessions of an annual conference, most  of them being rehashes of the authors' previous work. In any case, attendance  is pathetic as people rush between simultaneous sessions.
				</p>
				<p>
					How can conferences be made more 'scientific'? The most important aspect is the  organisational foresight and cooperation of groups to improve sessions. Papers  selected for presentation should be peer reviewed. Quality papers, the sine qua  non of a successful meeting, can be expected only if the organisation carefully  scrutinises the submitted abstracts. Duplicate presentation should be  discouraged. Speakers should be chosen on the basis of their abilities, not  their position or designation in the association. Bigwigs should be expected to  do justice to the topic allotted to them, as many young trainees look up to  them for professional guidance.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to Gitanjali, 'What I expect speakers to do is share their expertise,  experiences and in-depth knowledge with the audience and give the topic their  own flavour, not reproduce what is on websites or project slides available on  the net <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B. Bags, banquets and boring speeches: the bane of conferences. Indian J Pharmacol 2003;35:348." id="2">(2)</a>.' The chairpersons or judges should be informed well in advance of  the papers to be presented in their sessions and they should be prepared  accordingly. Parallel sessions should be banned, so that the audience can  devote its time to the session and only top-quality scientific papers should  fit in the scheduled time of the conference.
				</p>
				<p>
					To  conclude, 'I am confident that there will be a conference in the future where  there will be no bags, no inaugural ceremonies, no banquets but top-quality  science. I am waiting for that day <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B. Bags, banquets and boring speeches: the bane of conferences. Indian J Pharmacol 2003;35:348." id="2">(2)</a>.'

				<h4>Correction</h4>
				<p>
					A  number of editing errors were made in the article 'Why life-saving drugs should  be public goods' by Rachana Kamtekar (IJME, 2004;1:77-8). These errors are  regretted. The following corrections should be noted:
					<br />
					The second sentence in the introductory paragraph should read: 'Omar Swartz  presents a number of good arguments in favour of treating the formulae for  making HIV and other life-saving drugs as public goods rather than as private  property: ideas can be shared without being used up; the most effective use of  blueprints for life-saving medicine is to provide drugs to sick people;  finally, it is clearly unreasonable if 'a person who owns something...can dispose  of (or control access to) that [thing] ... without regard for others.'
				</p>
				<p>
					The first sentence of the second paragraph should read: 'But where, in all of  these considerations, do we find the claims of those who have devoted their  labour, time, and resources to the research that goes into developing  medicines?'
				</p>
				<p>
					In the fourth paragraph, the second sentence should read: 'For example, it is  argued that patents promote innovation by guaranteeing that the incentive  innovators have to do research (i.e. profit) is protected, and by enabling  innovators to share their knowledge so that others can build on their discoveries  or inventions upon payment.'
