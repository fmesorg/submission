				<h4>The quotable Osler. Eds: Mark E Silverman, T Jock Murray, Charles S Bryan  Philadelphia: American College of Physicians, 2003. pp 283. ISBN 1-9305-1334-8 </h4>
				<p>
					More has been written  about Sir William Osler (1849-1919) than about any other physician, including  probably Hippocrates. Called 'the best doctor of all time' some years after his  death by <em>JAMA,</em> he inspired medical students and doctors in Europe and North  America where he practised medicine, and continues to do so all over the world  even today, over 80 years after his death. He was a mentor to numerous  physicians and surgeons, many of whom were to achieve fame in their  professional lives. Osler societies and clubs all over the world as well as  numerous articles and books on the man stand testimony to this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Osler was particularly  well known for his humanist approach to medical practice. He left behind a rich  legacy of more than 1,600 writings covering medical, philosophical, educational  and historical papers, essays and books. Among the numerous reasons Osler  remains relevant today, is his principled stand on many things.
				</p>
				<p>
					The quotable Osler is a  compilation of many of Osler's quotations and sayings that cover the broad  field of medical practice and life outside the profession. The book also  includes a short biographical sketch of the man by Richard L Golden (modified  from an earlier article that appeared in <em>JAMA</em>), which should be informative to  both Oslerolators as well as students who are new to the subject. We learn, for  instance, from the article that 1,50,000 copies of Aequanimitas and other  essays by Osler were distributed to medical students by the Eli Lilly Co.  between 1932 and 1953.

				<p>
					Osler's aphorisms (812  of them) are organised by topics such as personal qualities, the art and  practice of medicine, the medical profession, diagnosis, etc. A thorough index  and a list of sources for the quotations are provided. They are best read  randomly and provide excellent material for quotations. In fact, the jacket  states that the book is an ideal source for those seeking an apt quotation for  an article or for those wanting to sample his thought-provoking and uplifting  messages. However, Osler and his writings seem to be more relevant today, in  the present era of erosion of ethics and commercialisation of the medical  profession. In this context, Osler's writings assume scriptural significance  and should be read by everyone connected with the profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of his statements  on specific illnesses such as gastric carcinoma or syphilis are either outdated  or simply do not add much by way of being different or wise. But some of his  quotes are apt today, as is his comment that courting the press can be dangerous:  'In the life of every physician there comes the temptation to toy with the  Delilah of the press-daily and otherwise. There are times when she may be  courted with satisfaction, but beware! sooner or later she is sure to play the  harlot, and has left many a man shorn of his strength, viz. the confidence of  his professional brethren.' Words of advice to many physicians who practise  market medicine! Or consider this: 'You have of course entered the profession  of medicine with a view of obtaining a livelihood, but in dealing with your  patients, let this always be a secondary consideration.'
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors are  distinguished Oslerians and one of them, Charles S Bryan, has written earlier  on Osler. His book Osler: inspirations from a great physician (Oxford University  Press, 1997) is a masterpiece and indeed copies of this book are being  distributed to medical students by drug companies in the USA. Both books, <em>The  quotable Osler as well as Osler: inspirations from a great physician,</em> demonstrate why Osler was revered then and continues to be a role model to the  many who wish to practise medicine of the old school.
