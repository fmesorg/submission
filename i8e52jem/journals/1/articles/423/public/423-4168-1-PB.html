			<h2>MEDICAL STUDENTS SPEAK</h2>
			<h3>Residents' strikes on policy issues</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Vishal Sharma, Sourabh Aggarwal</h4>

			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Strikes by residents or medical students have become fairly common and the new trend is to resort to strikes to protest matters concerning health policies. This article discusses the justification for and the ethical issues involved in these strike actions. Mechanisms to prevent such strikes are also discussed.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Indian resident doctors and medical students seem to have
					found a new political voice. Usually their protests are limited to
					issues concerning remuneration, safety at the workplace and
					better working conditions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Naik A. Resident doctors on strike. Issues Med Ethics 1996 Apr-Jun;4(2):46-7." id="1">(1).</a> Even today, residents in many
					states of India get paltry salaries despite putting in long hours
					of work each week. Almost all residents in clinical disciplines
					work much more than the 48 hours a week specified in
					residency rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, however, residents have been striking work and
					organising protests on issues concerning policy matters. Of
					course residents have struck work in the past over policy matters
					(the MARD strike over setting up of private medical colleges in
					1984) but the rate at which it is happening now is alarming <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lokhandwala Y. Should doctors strike work? Issues Med Ethics 1996 Apr-Jun; 4(2):47-8." id="2">(2)</a>.

				<h4>The reservations issue</h4>
				<p>
					In March 2006 the Indian government proposed introduction
					of a 27% quota for &quot;other backward classes&quot; (OBCs) in higher
					education institutions of the central government <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Half of IIM, IIT seats may be reserved. Hindustan Times 2006, Mar 28;[cited 2008 Aug 31]. Available from: http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=eced0217-4614-443a-8781-67a86dfae7a5" id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Caste-based quotas in educational institutions and jobs are
					not new to India. The ancient and well entrenched caste
					system ensured discrimination against the lower castes
					whose members were treated as untouchables and remained
					educationally, economically and socially backward. To combat
					these inequalities, the Constitution of India gave the Scheduled
					Castes and Tribes reservations in education and jobs when
					India became an independent nation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many believe that the quotas or reservations have created
					a &quot;creamy layer&quot; among OBCs, which is pocketing all the
					benefits. The new provisions by the central government are
					seen as being meant for the not-so-backward but politically
					strong lobby of the OBCs. These castes constitute a large
					population and reserving seats for them would reap immense
					electoral benefits for the ruling coalition. Interestingly, OBCs
					refer to backward classes and not backward castes but the
					definition of an OBC was based on the person's caste. Also,
					these reservations have created an ever-increasing demand by
					various caste groups to be labelled backward.
				</p>
				<p>
					The central government proposals were not acceptable to a
					vast majority of Indian medical students. They believed that
					the proposal was aimed at deriving electoral benefit. How
					can one claim to fight the caste system by reserving seats
					on the basis of caste, they queried. If caste has to cease to be
					a reality in modern India, we have to go beyond caste and
					creed. Were not the proposals aimed at creating divisions
					amongst Indian youth?
				</p>
				<p>
					Indian medical students came together under the banner
					of &quot;Youth for Equality&quot; and started organising nationwide
					peaceful protests against the new reservation proposals. They
					demanded that caste-based reservations be revoked. On
					May 13, 2006, the Mumbai police ruthlessly lathi-charged the
					peacefully protesting medical students thereby provoking the
					five medical colleges of Delhi to go on an indefinite hunger
					strike and the resident doctors to strike work <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatia R. Police beat up medicos. Daily News and Analysis 2006, May 14;[cited 2008 Aug 31]. Available from: http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1029206" id="4">(4)</a>. The eminent
					All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) became the
					epicentre of the struggle and tents were pitched on its lawns
					by the striking students.
				</p>
				<p>
					The strike continued for almost three weeks even as negotiations
					between the striking students and government officials,
					including the prime minister, failed <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Press Trust of India.

					Delhi were affected from the very first day. Other cities joined in
					and soon the agitation had taken a pan-India shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many labelled the protesting medicos as upper caste
					elites who were fighting for their personal benefit. Threats
					of sacking as well as the offer of leaving all general seats
					untouched failed to move the protestors. Then the Supreme
					Court intervened and asked the doctors to get back to work.
					Eventually everyone came around and the 19 day agitation
					came to an end <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indo-Asian news service. Quota: Protesting medicos to call off strike.

				<h4>Prof Venugopal and autonomy of AIIMS</h4>
				<p>
					The dust over the reservations issue had not completely
					settled when the government kicked up another row by
					unceremoniously sacking Prof Venugopal, the director of AIIMS,
					who, it believed, had supported the strike.
				</p>
				<p>
					The resident doctors again struck work, this time to demand
					Prof Venugopal's reinstatement. The faculty association of AIIMS
					also backed the director, and saw the health minister's action
					as undermining the autonomy of the institute. The matter
					reached the courts and the judiciary reprimanded the minister
					and stayed the director's removal <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Times News Network.

				<h4>Compulsory rural postings</h4>
				<p>
					India has a dearth of doctors especially in rural areas. To
					overcome the problem the government toyed with the idea
					of a compulsory one-year stint in rural areas for students prior
					to their graduation, thus increasing the duration of the MBBS
					course by a year.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scheme was first implemented in Tamil Nadu where it was
					greeted with protests by medical students <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medicos, house surgeons observe strike. The Hindu 2007 Sep 6; [cited 2008 Aug 31]. Available from: http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/06/stories/2007090652100300.htm" id="8">(8)</a>. The students
					argued that this would only serve to increase the duration of
					the course to six and a half years and that the government was
					shying away from appointing regular staff for rural areas.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The right to strike</h4>
				<p>
					In all the three instances-the OBC reservation, the AIIMS
					director, and rural postings-the resident doctors were
					protesting against policy issues which do not directly concern
					their working conditions or pay scales. The issue of whether
					resident doctors should strike work has been discussed on
					numerous occasions and therefore anything said would be a
					mere repetition <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Naik A. Resident doctors on strike. Issues Med Ethics 1996 Apr-Jun;4(2):46-7." id="1">(1)</a>. Suffice it to say that the resident doctor's
					work concerns human lives and hence stopping work should
					be done on rare occasions and under rare circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					Threats to the lives of working doctors would be the most
					justifiable reason to protest. Nobody has the right to attack
					a doctor on duty; complaints of negligence can be handled
					in the appropriate forum. Hence the reactions and protests
					resulting from such incidents are probably justifiable. Also,
					one can empathise with protests that aim to obtain more pay
					and better working/living conditions for residents who work
					impossible hours and get little in return. The trend to protest
					policy decisions, however, is not entirely tenable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Policy decisions and the residents</h4>
				<p>
					To make policies and programmes is the job of the legislature
					and the executive. Policies have to be made to accommodate
					the felt needs of a lot of groups including the doctors, nurses,
					support staff, and above all the patients. The doctors alone
					cannot be entrusted this responsibility and therefore the new
					position the government is considering regarding rural postings
					or any other policy matter (like the appointment of the director
					of AIIMS) cannot be held to ransom by protesting against it.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not to absolve the government of irresponsible behaviour
					in not taking all the stakeholders into confidence before
					going ahead with such proposals. It is but natural that medical
					students feel aggrieved at the sudden increase of a year in the
					MBBS course. It would have been better if implementation
					of the new rule had begun with a new batch of students who
					would be aware of what they were getting into. But does this
					give residents the right to strike work and put human lives in
					danger? After all, there are so many things one does not agree
					with and yet one has to accept them. The job of residents is to
					provide healthcare to patients, and while they have every right
					to ask for their due (good pay, security at the workplace and
					good working conditions), they must not interfere in policy
					matters which are the government's responsibility.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Concerns of residents and medical students</h4>
				<p>
					It is also pertinent to point out that the government healthcare
					system, especially the tertiary system, is basically resident
					based. It is the sweat and toil of these young professionals
					that makes the system work. With the worst of facilities, grossly
					understaffed and crowded Out Patient Department and
					casualties, it is their hard work that saves the day, every day. To
					neglect the aspirations of such individuals is something that no
					responsible government should do. Any decision likely to affect
					the lives and careers of residents and students should at least
					be first discussed with them and their views taken into account.
				</p>
				<p>
					The concerns of students in all the situations where they struck
					work were genuine. One can argue about whether the strike
					was a logical step, but everybody must agree that the concerns
					of residents should be dealt with fairly. Since civil society and
					the government expect residents never to strike work, it is their
					collective responsibility to ensure that residents' concerns are
					quickly redressed. Here lies the solution to this vexed issue. A
					responsible, caring government can ensure that residents never
					strike. For every strike that resident doctors resort to, at least a
					part of the blame lies with the health ministry.
