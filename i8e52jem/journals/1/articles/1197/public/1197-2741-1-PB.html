					There is one subject related to health care workers,  particularly nurses, that I have never heard discussed, whether in government or  in private hospitals, where nurses form the largest workforce. I refer to  occupational health safety for nurses in the context of blood-borne infections  including HIV. This includes training to reduce the risk of HIV exposure,  availability of appropriate protection, post-exposure care, and employment  security on becoming HIV-positive. This has serious implications in the context  of people's right to treatment regardless of HIV status.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the absence of statistics from India, statistics from the  United States provide some insight into this occupational risk. Needle stick and  other percutaneous injuries are among the most common and avoidable occupational  hazards in the hospital. Percutaneous injury was associated with 89% of  documented transmissions of HIV. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U S HIV and AIDS cases reported through December 1998. HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report 1998; 10(2): 26." id="1">(1)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on data from a number of prospective studies of health  care workers exposed to HIV-infected blood through percutaneous injury, the CDC  estimates a transmission rate of 0.3 % per injury. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gerberding J L.

				</p>
				<p>
					The public tends to believe that patients are cured solely  due to the efforts of doctors. The doctor may be the team leader, but it is the  nurses who physically care for patients. Common procedures that involve blood  and body fluids - starting an intravenous line, suctioning a patient's throat,  mouth, handling a bleeding accident victim in the emergency department - expose  nurses to a variety of diseases. It is the nurse who generally attempts to stop  bleeding, cleans the patient of blood on his body, and starts blood  transfusions.
				</p>
				<p>
					A visit to any government or municipal hospital provides a  clear picture of the risks faced by nurses. There is a lack of basic protective  barriers like gloves and masks, and absolutely no training on universal  precautions.
				</p>
				<p>
					A colleague with over 26 years of experience recollects,  "During our training days in the 1960s, we did not get gloves in the government  hospitals. If there were gloves available it would be given to the doctor. We  had to conduct deliveries with our bare hands." The situation is not very  different in most hospitals today. The only exception is in private hospitals,  where patients pay for every pair of gloves used by the hospital staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					Student nurses are far worse off. In teaching hospitals,  senior ward sisters would scream if they found student nurses using gloves. It  was a lucky student who was given a pair of gloves - which they could use for  the whole shift. Imagine the level of hygiene this implies, and the scope for  cross infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					If these are the circumstances in teaching hospitals, is it  possible to even talk of adequate protective facilities in primary and secondary  care facilities, let alone in remote parts of the country?
				</p>
				<p>
					The emotional impact of a needle stick injury can be severe  and long lasting, even when a serious infection is not transmitted. The impact  is particularly severe when the injury involves exposure to HIV. In one study of  20 health care workers with an HIV exposure, 11 reported acute severe distress,  six quit their jobs, and seven had persistent moderate distress as a result of  the exposure. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Henry K, Campbell S.

				<h4>Case reports</h4>
				<p>
					In one of the private hospitals that I worked in, we kept  detailed assessments and follow-up reports of all needle stick injuries as part  of our infection control programme. Forty-six cases of needle stick injuries  were reported over two years by various categories of health care workers. The  following case reports illustrate a number of preventable practices that can  lead to needle stick injuries.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a paediatric intensive care unit the resident doctor  collected blood from a patient. He left the sample - in the syringe with an  uncapped needle - on the bed, where it got lost in the bedclothes. Some time  later, the nurse tidied the bed clothes to make the patient comfortable when she  was pricked by the sharp needle. Later she was told that the child was HIV  positive. She was treated with two drugs as prophylaxis. She developed toxic  effects of the liver and also went through a phase of depression. ??A patient  suffering from AIDS was admitted to the private ward of the hospital. As part of  the admission routine, the nurse did a finger prick to collect a drop of the  patient's blood and assess his glucose levels. After the prick and before  collecting the drop of blood on to the test strip, she tried to recap the needle  in a hurry and sustained a deep injury with the needle. We did the necessary  blood tests and started the nurse on a two-drug regimen. This nurse, too, went  into a deep depression and had to be granted leave for over a month. The total  cost of treatment of Rs 18,000 was borne by the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					A nurse was walking out of the patient's room with a used  syringe and needle in an injection tray, after having given an intra-muscular  injection when she bumped into another nurse in a hurry. When the two banged  into each other, the syringe with the needle fell from the tray on the nurse's  hand and she got a prick.
				</p>
				<p>
					The nurse was starting an intravenous line on a patient. She  had identified the vein and placed the cannula. As she was removing the steel  stilette from the cannula, the patient pulled his hand back violently. The  stilette went through the nurse's forearm and she suffered a deep injury. A year  later she tested HIV positive. She had to move from active clinical work into  teaching. Since she was working in a government set-up she is being treated free  of cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indiscipline on the part of medical staff also results in  percutaneous injuries. Sharp objects such as trocars, surgical blades and  needles are left on the trolley for nurses to clear up after procedures. At the  hospital where I worked in the United Kingdom, it was mandatory for the user of  sharps to clear them into the sharps container. Nurses had the authority to make  sure that this etiquette was followed strictly. This rule applied to all health  care workers who used any kind of sharps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nurses who are known to be HIV positive face discrimination  at the work place. There is a constant threat of loss of employment. They are  rejected by their peers and co-workers. They become subjects of humiliating  remarks. Their career comes to a full stop and they suffer from severe  depression.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have found that the majority of new graduate nurses cannot  answer basic questions on universal precautions. But there are also instances  where nurses are fully aware of the universal precautions, but have no supplies  to practice them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inadequate protective facilities, and cumbersome procedures  to get even basic materials such as gloves, directly affect the attitudes of  nursing personnel. Indifference to the sick, and ineffective and inefficient  management of health services, can sometimes be related to health workers'  concern for personal safety. This has serious implications in the context of  people's right to treatment regardless of HIV status. How can one enforce that  right unless health care workers are assured that they are adequately protected?  How can one talk of the ethical duty of a nurse to provide care unless the nurse  is enabled to do so without the constant risk of injury? Can they even prevent  harm to their patients? Can we have patient autonomy if there is no autonomy of  action for nurses? How does one expect them to care for patients in the true  meaning and philosophy of nursing? In the context of the occupational risk faced  by health care workers, the best way to prevent occupationally acquired  infection is to prevent needle stick injury. Employers must ensure the  availability of adequate protective devices. The least that can be done is to  provide disposable gloves (50 paise per pair) and equipment such as needle  destroyers. They must also eliminate the use of needles where safe and effective  alternatives are available. All nurses must be properly trained in the safe use  and disposal of needles. Procedures must also be established to encourage  reporting and timely follow-up of all needle stick and other sharp related  injuries. Hospitals must give support to injured staff. Nurses should also be  empowered to speak out on occupational safety, and their suggestions given  immediate attention.
