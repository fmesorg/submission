				<h4>Audits of electroconvulsive therapy</h4>
				<p>
					Waikar et al. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waikar A, Davar B, Karhadkar C, Bansode D, Dandekar D, Kakade S, Wayal S, Kulkarni Y. ECT without anaesthesia is unethical. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:41-43." id="1">(1)</a>, in  their diatribe against ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) in general, and  unmodified or direct ECT in particular, were shocked that our institutional  ethics committee permitted an 11-year 'study' of unmodified ECT <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214. 3" id="2">(2)</a>, where  patients whose 'fearful refusal of a hazardous and life-threatening procedure'  were 'considered as a mere symptom of insanity, and further treated with  sedatives'. They were appalled that ECT was given to children, elderly and  pregnant women. They contend that our report trivialised the 'horrific'  physical complications with direct ECT and 'the costs of disability days following  ECT'. They wonder 'why presumably rational scientists produce such irrational  arguments to safeguard a scientifically dubious and highly hazardous  procedure', concluding that it is because we 'make a lot of money by giving  ECT'.

					ECT is an invasive procedure,  like neurosurgery, and considerations of morbidity or mortality must therefore  be viewed in this context. Untreated or treatment refractory mental illness  kills and wastes precious lives. There is incontrovertible evidence that ECT is  an effective treatment for depression <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The UK ECT Review Group. Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet 2003;361:799-808." id="3">(3)</a>, and substantial evidence that it is  effective in mania <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mukherjee S, Sackeim HA, Schnur DB. Electroconvulsive therapy of acute manic episodes: review of 50 years' experience. Am J Psychiatry 1994;151:169-176." id="4">(4)</a> and schizophrenia <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Adams CE. Electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002;(2):CD000076" id="5">(5)</a>, especially when other treatments  fail. There is no credible evidence that ECT causes brain damage <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Devanand DP, Dwork AJ, Hutchinson ER, Bolwig TG, Sackeim HA. Does ECT alter brain structure? Am J Psychiatry 1994;151:957-970." id="6">(6)</a>. ECT is  not contraindicated, and may be especially effective, in pregnant women,  children or the elderly <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="American Psychiatric Association. The practice of electroconvulsive therapy: recommendations for treatment, training and privileging. Task force report on ECT. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2001." id="7">(7)</a>.

					Ours was not a  prospective research study but a retrospective chart audit of clinical practice <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214. 3" id="2">(2)</a>. Over 11 years, 6.3% of the 28,929 patients registered at our centre were  treated with ECT, hardly the overenthusiastic and indiscriminate use implied by  Waikar et al. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waikar A, Davar B, Karhadkar C, Bansode D, Dandekar D, Kakade S, Wayal S, Kulkarni Y. ECT without anaesthesia is unethical. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:41-43." id="1">(1)</a>. Of the 13,597 individual treatments given to 1,835 patients,  the physical morbidity included spinal compression fractures and transient  myalgia in less than 1%, resulting in short-lived pain but no disability,  neurological deficits or long-term sequelae over up to 8 years follow-up. One  patient died (mortality rate 0.05%) of a cardiac arrhythmia, though the  subsequent 12 years and approximately 2,000 additional patients treated have  not seen additional mortality.

					In spite of this low  complication rate for an invasive procedure, all treatment conducted here since  1995 have been modified under anaesthetic supervision, and our practice,  frequently audited, conforms to the international technical and ethical  standards. No patient has ever received ECT without personally (or a  responsible relative) consenting. Fear of ECT is less with modified than  with unmodified ECT but in both situations an unknown and reputedly hazardous procedure  does generate apprehension, just as with tooth extraction or brain surgery.  Pre-ECT sedation reduces apprehension. ECT, as practised in our centre, is  hardly a lucrative enterprise since costs are low (Rs 180 per modified  treatment, excluding anaesthetic drug costs) and many patients' treatments are  free or heavily subsidised. Finally, our patients and their relatives have  endorsed our use of ECT <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prashanth NR. Attitudes of psychiatric patients and their relatives towards informed consent for electroconvulsive therapy. MD Dissertation. The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University, 1998." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unmodified ECT is aesthetically less appealing to patients and clinicians alike  than modified ECT. Consideration of ways to phase out direct ECT such as  changing from thrice a week to the equally effective twice a week regimen to  reduce anaesthetist demand, or forming group practices with shared ECT and  anaesthetic facilities, or deputing psychiatric personnel to get specialist  anaesthetic training are inevitable, if ECT is to survive another 50 years.  However, banning direct ECT overnight by legal action without ensuring the  continued and effective delivery of ECT is tantamount to closing down mental hospitals  without ensuring adequate community care. Many clinicians, without access to  anaesthetists, would face denying seriously mentally ill patients an effective  treatment. Such a 'collateral damage' resulting from well-intentioned action is  as unethical and unacceptable as some recent international events.
