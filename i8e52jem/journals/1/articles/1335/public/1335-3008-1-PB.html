				<h4>Stem cells from India</h4>
				<p>
					India is tightening  regulations on research on human embryonic stem cells to prepare for research  within the country as well as possible international projects that might  involve embryonic material from India. This follows concern that India could  emerge as a major source of embryonic stem cells as there is almost no public  or religious debate on abortion, which is legal across India.
				</p>
				<p>
					A national bioethics  panel, set up by India's department of biotechnology, has drafted new  guidelines for human genomics research that also cover rules for the collection  and use of embryonic stem cells. The panel said that scientists may harvest  human embryos for research before day 14 of gestation with the informed consent  of the donor. All projects would have to be approved by the national bioethics  panel, and researchers would have to share any commercial benefits that emerge  from embryonic stem cell lines with the donor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Senior officials say  that the new rules draw on existing ethical guidelines from the Indian Council of  Medical Research but that they will be enforceable.
				</p>
				<p>
					"They have been  approved by the law ministry and are intended to be legally binding," said  Dr Virender Vinayak, adviser for medical research in the department of  biotechnology. Two Indian research centres are among 10 worldwide named by the  US National Institutes of Health as holding human stem cell lines that are  eligible for US federal research funds. Government officials have said they may  need to regulate in vitro fertilisation clinics that are potential sources of  embryonic stem cells.

				<h4>AIIMS doing a bad job</h4>
				<p>
					India's leading public  hospital and medical education centre has failed to provide high quality  medical services to its patients, a government audit report has said.
				</p>
				<p>
					A shortage of doctors  and infrastructure deficiencies at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences,  New Delhi, is depriving patients of quality time in diagnosis and medical care,  the report by India's auditor general said.
				</p>
				<p>
					An outpatient at the  institute on average gets four to nine minutes of attention from a doctor,  while the waiting time for surgery ranges from two to 34 months, it said. And  at least three patients terminally ill with cancer are turned away each day for  lack of healthcare facilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report also said the  institute failed to nurture trained medical professionals and stop the 'brain  drain'. The government subsidises medical education at the institute, but 49  per cent of a sample of 390 doctors who had trained there had emigrated.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The patient load  we get is the price we're paying for our efficiency," said Dr Pradeep  Kumar Dave, director of the institute. The outpatient department, originally  designed to cater for 500 patients a day, now receives nearly 6,000 each day.
				</p>
				<p>
					The institute is India's  most attractive site for medical education, with more than 35,000 candidates  taking a screening examination for the institute's undergraduate medical degree  programme that accepts 50 students each year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Dave said that the  institute could not be expected to exercise control over students who prefer to  emigrate. Health policy analysts say that the situation at the institute merely  exemplifies the deterioration of health care services in the government sector.  "An institution intended for tertiary care has been reduced to a general  hospital," said Alok Mukhopadhyay, executive director of India's Voluntary  Health Association.

				<h4>'But it was legal then...'</h4>
				<p>
					The law is clear: you  cannot conduct or 'cause to conduct' a test to find out the sex of your foetus.  If you do so, you can be imprisoned for up to three years. But the Prenatal  Diagnostic Techniques (PNDT) Regulation Act came into effect only five years  ago, and that's why a couple in Surat and their doctors are very lucky.
				</p>
				<p>
					For not only did they  determine the sex of the foetus, they aborted it when told it was female. After  the abortion, when the parents discovered that the foetus was male, they  dragged the doctors to the consumer court and were recently awarded damages  with interest. In October 1992, Rita Jadhav, resident of Dhova village in  Bhavnagar and a mother of three daughters, wanted a male child and so she  consulted gynaecologist Sushma Iyer when she became pregnant for the fourth  time. Iyer sent the uterine fluid sample to Surat-based pathologist Nirmal Vaniwala  who identified the foetus as a female.
				</p>
				<p>
					The couple came back to  Iyer saying they wanted a second test to confirm the findings but Iyer  suggested an abortion going by Vaniwala's report.
				</p>
				<p>
					The couple could not  afford Iyer's abortion fees so they went to the local SDVS Ashaktashram  hospital and had an abortion done. The doctor who conducted the abortion told  them the foetus was a male.
				</p>
				<p>
					The distressed  couple approached Jagrut Nagrik, a consumer-protection organisation in  Vadodara, and filed a case against the Surat-based gynaecologist and  pathologist with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. They acused  the doctors of negligence and violation of medical ethics. PV Moorjani, Jagrut  Nagrik secretary who filed the case, claimed a compensation of just over Rs 10  lakh.
				</p>
				<p>
					The commission, in its  order in July, observed that there was collusion between the gynaecologist and  the pathologist which prevented a second test. The commission also observed  that both the doctors were registered with the Medical Council and had  performed a sex determination test though it was against medical ethics, and  this amounted to medical negligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The two doctors were  directed to pay Rs 25,000 with 10 per cent interest within four weeks of the  order to the parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					"We have only seen  the case from the scientific point of view and the doctor should have conducted  the test carefully," said Justice Mahendrabhai Parikh, chief of the  commission who delivered the verdict. Justice Parikh declined to comment on the  case saying that the judgement speaks for itself and only the High Court can  take up the matter. He added that in this particular case the "sex  determination test may have been done before it was banned." Under  existing law the story would have been quite different. "This is a  criminal case and both the parents and the doctors can be imprisoned and fined  for breaking the law," says A R Nanda, union secretary of family welfare.
				</p>
				<p>
					For not only are sex  determination tests 'against medical ethics', as the commission has noted in  its judgement, the PNDT Act clearly makes it illegal. It notes that prenatal  procedures should be only done to determine 'chromosomal abnormalities, genetic  metabolic disease, haemoglobinopathies, sex-linked genetic diseases and  congenital abnormalities', and that "no person conducting prenatal  diagnostic procedures shall communicate to the pregnant woman concerned or her  relatives the sex of the foetus by words, signs or in any other manner."
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the offences and  penalties section, the Act says that the guilty shall be punished with  imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years with fine which may  extend to Rs 10,000. Under the Act, not only are the doctors guilty for telling  the parents the sex of the foetus, but the parents are as guilty of seeking the  sex determination test for the obvious purpose of aborting the girl child.
				</p>
				<p>
					"There is clear  evidence against both the doctors and the parents in the case and the  appropriate authorities, who are empowered to implement the PNDT Act, should  take action against both parties for breaking the law," says Nanda.

				<h4>Kidney trade</h4>
				<p>
					In response to a  petition filed in the Bombay High Court by surgeon Dr Mahesh Jukar, challenging  the nine charges framed against him by a lower court, for illegal kidney  transplantation, the state argued that there was substantial evidence to prove  that Dr Jukar was actively involved in illegal surgeries and pointed out  evidence that warrants conviction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The case refers to a  flourishing kidney transplantation racket at an Ayurvedic dispensary by the  name of Kaushalya Nursing Home in Linking Road, Khar, which was owned by Dr  Santosh Raut, main accused in the case. The dispensary was started in 1989 and  Dr Raut, through agents, would bring people from Gulf countries for kidney  transplantation. Agents would, under false excuses, also bring donors &ndash; who  would in most cases be illiterate and poor people. While the donors would get  Rs 40,000, Dr Raut would get money in dollars. The amount received by the  agents would be between Rs 30,000 and Rs 35,000 while Dr Raut would get  anything between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3.75 lakh. The patients would come from  countries like Turkey, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Yugoslavia, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prior to 1994, Dr Raut  had a surgeon by the name of Dr Yogesh Kothari to help him in the  transplantation as Dr Raut himself was not a qualified surgeon. The dispensary  also had no license for surgery. From 1994 onwards, Dr Raut employed two  surgeons &ndash; Dr Mahesh Jukar and R Abhay Dalvi &ndash; to do the transplantation. Dr  Dalvi was attached to KEM hospital. Besides these two surgeons, Dr Vishwas Sane  and Dr Dilip Rana were employed as anaesthetists. The modus operandi would be  simple &ndash; while Dr Jukar attended to the donor to remove the kidney, Dr Dalvi  and Dr Raut would be with the recipient. Approximately 225 cases were  done in this manner by Dr Raut.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the dispensary was  raided by the crime branch and various charges were filed, Dr Jukar  approached the court for a discharge. He stated that he was a young man in the  beginning of his career and he used to go for surgery to learn from other doctors.  He also argued that it was not his dispensary and he used to go only when he  was called and, hence, the prosecution should not be believed and he should  also be discharged. Among the evidence the prosecution pointed to was that the  register showed that more than 100 cases were done by Dr Jukar, all referred by  Dr Raut.

				<h4>Call to probe trials</h4>
				<p>
					The Consumer Education  and Research Society (CERS), Ahmedabad, has petitioned the National Human  Rights Commission (NHRC) for a probe into testing of experimental drugs on  unsuspecting patients in violation of ethical and medical norms.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CERS petition  follows reports of more than 20 clinical evaluations of new drugs being  conducted in India, on human subjects and patients. Many of these studies were  unauthorised and not properly monitored by competent regulatory medical or  ethics bodies, it added. In fact, the patients or the persons on whom the drugs  were being tested were not made aware of the risks involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					"It is highly  unethical to carry out clinical trials on humans without explaining to them the  risks involved in a language they understand and their consent taken in writing  before witnesses," CERS said. In this connection, it referred to the tests  conducted on the 'hapless patients' at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC) at  Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and the Metro Hospital in New Delhi.
				</p>
				<p>
					CERS also referred to  New Delhi's metro hospital where Dr Purshottam Lal injected vascular  endothelial growth factor into 11 heart patients without informing them of the  risks involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a press release, CERS  pointed out that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has adopted  elaborate ethical guidelines for biomedical research including clinical trials  on humans and said these tests have to be undertaken with the prior permission  of the DGCI. Further, the clinical tests are to be monitored at the site of the  test by an appropriately constituted institutional ethics committee (IEC).
				</p>
				<p>
					"CERS is concerned  about the alleged human rights violation of the patients who have received  these experimental drugs without their written consent, without their knowledge  and without following the established guidelines for these tests and of course,  prior permission of the DGCI. It is possible that the IEC did not perform its  expected duty by strictly monitoring these clinical studies on patients,"  the petition said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though the Kerala state  government has constituted an enquiry under Dr Purvesh Parikh to look into the  RCC experiments, the NHRC will have to investigate the issue in its entirety,  CERS said.
				</p>
				<p>
					It called upon the NHRC  to see that the DGCI submits a list of all the clinical trials being conducted  on humans and the names of the clinical centres where these are conducted in  the country.
