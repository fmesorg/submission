					How  many people know that eight patients in Hyderabad who were administered  recombinant streptokinase to test its efficacy and safety have died? According  to the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), the trial was being  conducted by the drug's manufacturer Shantha Biotechnics without taking  clearance. Not surprisingly, the company denies the allegation claiming that it  had taken permission from the Drugs Controller General, India (DCGI). In this  game of passing the buck, no one is shedding any tears on the lives lost or  compensating the families of those whose loved ones have died. Without any  independent enquiry, the death of 'trial subjects', as they are impersonally  called, has been attributed to 'causes other than the use' of the drug!

					Not long ago Dharmesh Vasava, a 22-year-old healthy 'volunteer' from Bharuch in  Gujarat, died while participating in tests on citalopram, an antipsychotic drug  sponsored by Mumbai-based Sun Pharmaceuticals. According to another participant  of the same trial, the subjects were lured with money by agents working for the  company. Needless to say, such exploitative inducements are both unethical and  illegal.
				</p>
				<p>
					More recently, over 400 unsuspecting young women were used as guinea pigs by  self-styled researchers to test if an anticancer drug Letrozole can help in  ovulation. The trials were conducted illegally, without taking permission from  the DCGI, predominantly at private clinics not recognised as research centres.  At least one 'investigator' with just a diploma in gynaecology could hardly  claim to be qualified or competent enough to try untested drugs. Strangely  enough, based on documents submitted by the innovator of the drug Novartis,  both the USFDA and the British Authority (MHRA) have labelled Letrozole as  embryotoxic, foetotoxic and teratogenic at miniscule doses! The results of the  apparently sponsored trials were extensively used by a Mumbai-based company to  illegally promote Letrozole for induction of ovulation.

					It may sound incredible but animals subjected to experiments in the United  States enjoy more protection than humans in India. Any trial done on animals  without the authority of the Ethics Committee is fined Rs 120,000 (US$ 2,500)  under the US Animal Welfare Act. In India, more than 400 young women have been  treated worse than animals in America. Such unethical and illegal trials are  conducted without any fear because regulatory authorities, either by design or  default, fail to take action.

					A  couple of years ago, new chemical entities called M4N and G4N, discovered in  the US, were unlawfully tested on 26 oral cancer patients at the Regional  Cancer Centre (RCC) at Thiruvananthapuram. Under unrelenting pressure from the  media and NGOs, an unwilling government was literally dragged into take action.  Instead of penalising the guilty, further research on M4N and G4N was merely  suspended for six months! In such cases, the law provides for three months'  imprisonment for the guilty.

					Legally, all clinical trials require DCGI permission and approval by the  concerned hospitals' Ethics Committees. Research can only be conducted at recognised  centres by duly qualified and experienced investigators. In practice, the DCGI  approves clinical trials the same way as ration cards are issued by food  inspectors. Some examples:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						As per the rules, trials of foreign drugs are permitted in India at one  step below the phase completed abroad. Yet, the DCGI approved Phase III trial  of Pfizer's Zoniporide even when Phase II trials had not been completed in the  USA. Furthermore, carcinogenic and reproductive studies on animals mandated by  Indian law had not been completed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cilansetron, a new molecule of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, not approved  anywhere in the world, was cleared for Phase III trials even though only Phase  II trials had been conducted abroad.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cilostazol, a product of Otsuka, was cleared by the DCGI based on  incomplete, inadequate information on adverse effects. Common serious  side-effects such as angina and myocardial infarction were not even mentioned.  Needless to say, such omissions can be life-threatening for the study subjects.
					</li>
					<li>
						The protocol of the drug Tacrolimus submitted by Panacea Biotec and  cleared by the DCGI was not only vague but also deficient and defective beyond  imagination. It did not even state the phase of the trial, an elementary  requirement, and omitted all important serious adverse effects such as  malignancies, cardiomyopathy, lymphoproliferative disorders, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					It appears that some protocols and accompanying documents, such as  Investigator's Brochures, are not even read by the DCGI. Otherwise, how does  one explain the approval of patently defective clinical trials? This perception  is strengthened by the super speed with which some proposals are cleared: a  voluminous protocol on trastuzumab sponsored by Roche was approved within 5  working days. It is humanly not possible to read and analyse the bulky  documents in such a short period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the clinical trials in India are conducted without any arrangement for  compensation in case of study-related injury, disability or even death in human  subjects. The ICMR Guidelines specifically require that each research 'shall  include in-built mechanism for compensation for the human subjectsâ€¦to cover all  foreseeable and unforeseeable risks.' Despite this clear requirement, the DCGI  routinely approves trials where no such undertaking is given by the sponsors.
				</p>

					The investigators for clinical trials, particularly when drugs are to be  tested, are chosen by sponsoring companies. All manufacturers want that their  products should be found safe and effective. There cannot be a better way to  ensure positive results than to select friendly, obliging and ever-willing  investigators to do the bidding. Many investigators who conduct clinical trials  are, or have been, beneficiaries of largesse from the pharmaceutical  manufacturers. The financial ties include paid speaking engagements, equity of  the sponsoring companies, expensive gifts such as cars, refrigerators, air  conditioners, medical equipment, attendance at sponsored scientific  conferences, paid consultancy work, authoring 'ghostwritten' scientific  articles, and travel grants for domestic and foreign travel. In 2002, a  Mumbai-based company marketing erythropoietin had obliged some 300 senior  nephrologists to visit Singapore on an expense-paid jamboree, an effective  strategy not only to garner more prescriptions but also to ensure positive  results of future clinical trials. Neither the regulatory authorities nor the  ethics committees seek conflict of interest information from investigators.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important area concerns the right to publish the results of trials. For  obvious reasons, no sponsor would like to publicise unfavourable results. With  few exceptions, most protocols bind investigators to seek prior permission  before publishing the trial results. This practice needs to be curbed. The  rules on clinical trials should be amended to insert a clause to make 'Freedom  to Publish' an essential criteria for approving trials. The world's top medical  journal editors have already decided that trials which restrict investigators  the freedom to publish will not be accepted.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is often argued that India should not be left behind in what is grandiosely  described as 'cutting-edge technology' of drug development. If at all India is  to become a big player, it will have to actually discover or synthesise new  drugs. Testing them in humans hardly involves any advanced technology. There  are preset procedures that can be found in any good book on human trials. No  wonder American companies have found doctors in Viet Nam as competent as those  in India in this field. Unless laws are honestly implemented by regulatory  authorities, the current unsupervised, unethical and often illegal clinical  trials will pave the way for similar trials in gene therapy that will leave  many Indians diseased, deformed and even dead. The way things are at present,  the regulators officially designated as public servants are in imminent danger  of becoming servants of the industry. WHO calls this phenomenon 'regulatory  capture', i.e. the authority is seized by the very interests it is supposed to  regulate.
