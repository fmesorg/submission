					Clinical trials of the  quinacrine nonsurgical sterilisation (QS) method raise a number of troubling  ethical issues. This update on the quinacrine saga will present some of these  dilemmas for discussion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Quinacrine sterilisation has alternately been portrayed as an outstanding  breakthrough for women in developing countries who die of pregnancy-related  complications -- or as an unethical, covert experiment on 100,000 unsuspecting  women in more than two dozen countries <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kessel, E: 100,000 cases of Quinacrine Sterilization. Advances in Contraception,12: 69-76, 1996." id="1">(1)</a>. Interest in the method had all but  subsided because the promoters of the method were considered to be overzealous  with a political agenda. However, Alix Freedman's article <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freedman, A: Population Bomb: Two American Contraceptive Researchers Export Sterilization Drug to Third World Wall Street Journal, June 19, 1998" id="2">(2)</a> critical of  practices uncovered in the Vietnam clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hieu, D. T. Tan, T. T., Tan, D. N., Nguyet, P. T., Than, P., and Vinh, D. Q: 31,781 cases of non-surgical female sterilization with Quinacrine pellets in Vietnam. Lancet 342: 213-217, 1993." id="3">(3)</a> generated a great deal  of interest in the mass media and elsewhere. In 1999, the National Medical  Committee (NMC) of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) decided  to evaluate QS by reviewing the literature, and meeting with QS promoters and  investigators. They also heard from a panel consisting of Dr. David Grimes,  Family Health International (FHI); Ms Rachael Pine, AVSC International; Dr.  Malcolm Potts and myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The NMC committee  recommended that a full scale investigational study of the safety and efficacy  of QS be conducted in the United States and that other similar studies be done  in several foreign countries. However, the PPFA Board of Directors voted against  it. This decision was influenced, at least in part, by a petition signed by  women health advocates from around the world urging PPFA not to approve  clinical trials. The petition cited several reasons, including the lack of  basic animal toxicology studies, the unethical nature of the past clinical  trials that lacked informed consent, and the potential for abuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unlikely that clinical trials will take place with the blessing of the  PPFA Board, at least not until the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) approves  toxicology studies being conducted by FHI. Proponents of QS are incensed that  their plans for clinical trials in the USA were temporarily thwarted. Sarah  Gamble Epstein circulated a "Dear Concerned Feminist" letter through various  feminist list serves and by mail stating: "a fraud has been perpetrated on the  Board of Directors of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA). The  quinacrine pellet method for non-surgical female sterilization (QS) is the  most important development since the creation of the Pill... A group of four  individuals, each with a long history of attacking other methods of  contraception such as the pill, IUDs, Depo Provera and Norplant are the  perpetrators of this fraud. They prepared the petition to the board that was  circulated at the meeting and considerably alarmed the members" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ebsite of the promoters of quinacrine: http//www.quinacrine.com/" id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I will not waste energy engaging in a point by point refutation of this  argument. However, there are many troubling issues with respect to QS. First,  what motivates the promoters of quinacrine in their fervent pursuit of this  method? Perhaps it is that many people accept dual standards, one for developed  countries and another for developing countries. Some would go so far as to say  that to do otherwise would be unethical <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mbidde, E: Bioethics and local circumstances. Science 279: 155, 1998" id="6">(6)</a>. Others suggest that lives of  600,000 women who die annually due to pregnancy-related complications,  including unsafe abortions would be saved if there were fewer pregnancies <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations International Conference on Population and Development Plan of Action, Cairo, 1994 Chapter 8, and the report of the 21st special session of the UN general assembly, New York, Jun 30-July 2, 1999." id="7">(7)</a>.  They calculate risk: benefit ratios for the QS method by treating pregnancy as  a disease <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mumford, S. D. and Kessel E: Sterilization needs in the 1990s: the case for quinacrine non-surgical female sterilization. American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, 167: 1203-1207, 1992." id="8">(8)</a>. These arguments coupled to the promoters' anti-immigrant  political agenda <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freedman, A: Population Bomb: Two American Contraceptive Researchers Export Sterilization Drug to Third World Wall Street Journal, June 19, 1998" id="2">(2)</a> explain why the method has support amongst certain  sections in the USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, if the method is so wonderful, why have the promoters not conducted  animal studies for the drug's potential carcinogenicity and mutagenicity? They  have argued that animal studies are not needed because thousands of soldiers  during the Second World War used it prophylactically, without serious problem <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kessel, E: Quinacrine sterilization: An assessment of risks for ectopic pregnancy, birth defects and cancer. Advances in Contraception 14: 81-90, 1998" id="9">(9)</a>. Preliminary results from neonatal mouse studies were submitted to the FDA,  who gave the go-ahead for a study with rats for reproductive toxicity and with  neonatal mice for carcinogenicity. As far back as 1994, the World Health  Organization had stated that these studies were essential before further clinical  trials <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Benagiano G: Quinacrine family planning method (letter to the editor Lancet 343:1425, 1994." id="10">(10)</a>: FHI has also been involved with the follow up of women in Vietnam  and in Chile. At the PPFA NMC meeting, Dr. Grimes said that the follow up of  the original Vietnam study had uncovered some problems. During the QS procedure  papaverine or ampicillin had been administered orally to some women but it was  not reported in the original publication <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Quinacrine segment on &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; broadcast on October 18, 1998. Commentator: Morley Safer." id="4">(4)</a>. Therefore, there were  difficulties in interpreting the efficacy data. Most women were satisfied with  the procedure but were concerned about failures and gynaecologic problems. They  did not find any difference in the rates of tubal pregnancy between QS and  surgical sterilisation. They also did not find any increase in rates of cancer <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sokal, D. C., Zipper, J., Guzman-Serani, R. and Aldrich, T. E., Cancer risk among women sterilized with trans-cervical quinacrine hydrochloride pellets, 1977-1991. Fertility and Sterility, 64: 325-334, 1995." id="11">(11)</a>; the follow up studies are ongoing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Third, why do the main promoters  of the method continue to publish "new data", collected under the pretext of  providing a sterilisation service in different countries, knowing that it will  always be suspect? Numerous papers essentially imply the same thing: that QS  method must be good because (a) so many different groups have "confirmed" the  results and (b) physicians from different countries get involved in the trials.  Incidentally, these physicians become the first authors on papers, present  "results" at international meetings and their travel expenses are paid for.  These publications serve the propaganda campaign on behalf of the sterilisation  method. The majority of papers on QS fail to describe whether informed consent  was obtained; in fact there is evidence that women were not aware of that they  were participating in a clinical trial <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freedman, A: Population Bomb: Two American Contraceptive Researchers Export Sterilization Drug to Third World Wall Street Journal, June 19, 1998" id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dasgupta, R: Telegraph, Sunday edition, January 19, 1997" id="12">12</a>, <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mulay, S: Quinacrine Sterilization: Unethical trials, Economic and Political Weekly, April 26, 1997 pp 877-879." id="13">13)</a>. Follow-up of women in a vast  majority of studies was about 12 months and in other instances it was sporadic  or entirely lacking <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="asgupta, R: Telegraph, Sunday edition, January 19, 1997 " id="12">(12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scientific analysis  includes collection of data using ethical guidelines that includes approval of  the protocol by an Institutional Ethics Board. Data obtained under any other  circumstance are tarnished and must be discarded
				</p>
				<p>
					QS literature helps develop support within United States for the method <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hanson, M: Why US women deserve QS as an option http//www.quinacrine.com" id="14">(14)</a>. The  NMC's recommendation helps build credibility for the method despite the PPFA  Board's decision. It is important for QS's proponents to keep the method in the  public eye and to win over different sectors in the regulatory process. Thus,  they continue to make presentations at professional conferences; and they list  upcoming conferences where they will have their information booths on their web  site <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Website of the promoters of quinacrine: http//www.quinacrine.com/" id="15">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					President Bill Clinton's announcement that he will seek approval from Congress  to impose fines on researchers and sponsoring universities who breach research  ethics, to the tune of $ 250,000 and $ one million, respectively, does not  address the issue of accountability <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Charatan, F: Research and Publication Ethics: Clinton seeks heavy fines for breaching research ethics. British Medical Journal 320: 1491, 2000." id="15">(15)</a>. It does not deal with researchers who  do not receive funding from US government agencies such as private foundations.  Moreover, the Declaration of Helsinki <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Declaration of Helsinki: Recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects. The 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, amended by the 29th World Medical Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975; the 35th World Medical Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983, 41st World Medical Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 and the 48th General Assembly, Somerset, South Africa, October, 1996." id="16">(16)</a> that governs clinical research in  all countries does not have a mandatory monitoring process.
				</p>
				<p>
					QS trials underscore the weaknesses in the guidelines to conduct clinical  trials, especially in countries where procedures for human clinical trials may  be weak or non-existent. It highlights how easy it is to by-pass the  regulatory process altogether.
				</p>
				<p>
					Virtually all checks and  balances seem to have failed in the majority of the studies on QS. No process  has been built-in to ensure accountability and transparency in this process.  There are no punitive measures against researchers violating ethical guidelines  and the approved clinical protocols, other than through class-action suits for  damages, an enormously difficult and expensive process inaccessible to most  people, especially those in developing countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even more troubling, there is considerable momentum to revise the Helsinki  Declaration to weaken language on research conducted in developing countries.  Although the proposed revisions strengthen the language concerning disclosure  of conflict of interest (Clause 11, proposed revisions document 17C/WW2/2000), Dr. Brennan <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brennan, T A: Sounding Board: Proposed revisions to the Helsinki Declaration. Will they weaken the ethical principles underlying human research? New England Journal of Medicine 341: 527-531,1999." id="17">(17)</a> suggests "article 24 of the revised declaration would allow  waiver of written informed consent if local ethics committees determined that  the risks posed by the research are slight or if the procedures to be used in  medical research are customarily used in medical practice without informed  consent... It would be a matter to be decided by local ethics committees, guided  by the local standard of care".
				</p>
				<p>
					This change can result  in clinical research moving to countries that have the poorest regulatory  process, just as manufacturing of goods under globalisation have moved to  countries with very low wages to minimise costs of production and maximise  profits with little regard for the health, safety and rights of workers. A  human rights framework must be urgently introduced in the area of medical  research <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Farmer, P: Pathologies of Power: Rethinking health and human rights. American Journal of Public Health, 39: 1486-1494, 1999." id="18">(18)</a> and accountability built in any undertaking in the clinical  research enterprise.
