				<h4>Medical Ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Congratulations (on the production of Medical Ethics). I know how much courage and decency it takes to fight for some degree of moral order in health care. It would certainly be much easier and advantageous to close the eyes and not be 'trouble-makers'.
				</p>

					The situation in Hungary is quite similar: immoral human experiments, discrimination (between) patients, lack of information, unethical medical practices without any punishment, over- and under-treatment, bribes both by drug companies and patients and highly immoral solidarity among the medical profession even at the slightest suspicion of negligence but, on the other hand, the degradation of colleagues in front of patients, etc. (We too, have) committees and panels with hardly any 'outsiders' (making it impossible to exercise) and any public control. Hospitals and other health care institutes are not only run in secrecy but in many cases as prisons where physicians' ORDERS must be obeyed and no , complaints tolerated.
				</p>
				<p>
					I consider your journal interesting, honest and affirmative. I could even notice a definite improvement: the August- October 1994 issue, for example, is remarkably attractive, systematic and easily readable. There is a question in this issue: 'Could we sensitise such groups to issues in medical ethics? ' My opinion is that the answer is yes. It can be done with the help of the media. In my efforts to fight against highly immoral practices, in most cases I have the backing of TV, radio, daily newspapers and journals. There are some decent people among them who are willing to take chances for legitimate causes.
