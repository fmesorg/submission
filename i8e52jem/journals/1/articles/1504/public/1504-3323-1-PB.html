					In such situations, the physician faces many ethical dilemmas
				</p>

				<p>
					Complementary  or alternate systems of medicine are being practiced all over the world. In our  country, we have a long tradition of alternate systems of medicine, such as  ayurveda, unani, homeopathy, etc., which are recognised by law and the  government. In addition, we also have newer, novel therapies such as ozone  therapy and magnetic therapy. Our patients tend to try these systems when they  have chronic illnesses or when they do not get relief from the allopathic  system.
				</p>
				<p>
					As practitioners of allopathic medicine, we face many ethical dilemmas when we  are confronted with patients who wish to try alternate systems of medicine.  This essay explores these dilemmas and the ethical issues involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					For many chronic conditions, allopathy has no cure or offers only palliation to  the patients. In such circumstances, patients resort to alternate systems of  medicine. Often, they ask the doctor's advice. An allopathy practitioner may  not have the knowledge of other systems. Hence he is not in a position to give  advice regarding the therapy. It would be perfectly ethical for him to say that  he does not know about the therapy and that the patient has to make the choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two ethical principles involved in this response. The first of these  is the need for not deceiving others. Alternate systems of medicine may have an  answer to the patient's problem. By not allowing the patient the benefit, the  practitioner is deceiving the patient through the practitioner's ignorance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other ethical elements involved are the virtues of compassion, honesty and  humility. When a patient is suffering and allopathic medicine cannot offer much  relief or a cure, it is compassionate on the part of the practitioner to allow  the patient to try alternate systems of medicine. A practitioner practices the  virtues of humility and honesty when he agrees to the patient's requests  because he accepts that his knowledge and skills are limited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just as there is a right not to deceive there is also an obligation on the part  of the practitioner to see that his patient is not deceived when he undertakes  an alternate system of medicine. If a practitioner has the knowledge that a  particular treatment is useless and would be a financial drain on the patient's  resources, it is the practitioner's duty to inform the patient accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, many alternate systems of medicine profess to have a cure for  AIDS. Some patients who have undergone these therapies have spent money and in  the end suffered and died. If the practitioner has this prior knowledge and if  a new patient asks about such therapies, a practitioner should have no  hesitation in advising against the therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Very often, patients ask their doctors whether they should discontinue allopathic  therapy when they try alternate systems of medicine. The answer to this  question depends on the situation. If there is a definite cure and there is a  public health hazard if the patient is not treated then a practitioner should  strongly advise the patient from discontinuing the medications. For example, in  TB there is an effective cure and non-treatment could lead to the spread of  infection in the community. Here the ethical principle involved is that of  beneficence. The practitioner is acting for the good of the patient while  protecting the rights of uninfected persons not to be infected. Practitioners  also have a duty to the community. When the allopathic therapy is beneficial  for the patients, my advice would be to continue both treatments, for example  insulin in NIDDM patients
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients may try alternate systems of medicine and return to allopathy when  they find the alternatives useless. What should practitioners do? Twenty or 30  years ago practitioners would refuse to treat such patients since they had  refused to practice what was ordered.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have come a long way from that paternalistic model of the patient-doctor  relationship. Nowadays most practitioners come to a shared understanding with  the patient about his therapy. Many physicians will berate such patients and  treat them again as if nothing has happened. Here they exhibit the virtue of  tolerance. The patient's experience also enhances the practitioner's knowledge  about the efficacy of the alternate therapy and its side-effects, enabling them  to give better advice to the next patient who asks about such therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can a practitioner refer a patient to a practitioner of an alternate system of  medicine? The code of medical ethics of the Indian Medical Council does not  permit it. The code states that a practitioner should not associate with a  person who does not practice medicine on a scientific basis. As the scientific  basis of many of the alternate systems of medicine is not known, a practitioner  should not refer a patient to an alternate system of medicine.
