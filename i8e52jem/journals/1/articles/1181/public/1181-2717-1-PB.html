				<h4>Some achievements, but many struggles ahead</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em> is now in its tenth year of existence, a very  long time for a journal run almost entirely on voluntary labour. While this  itself is an achievement, we are struggling on a number of levels. Comparing  this financial report to the last year's, there are some things for which we  are grateful. Our income exceeds our expenditure, and - more important - the  money we get from subscriptions covers our printing and postage. However, our  subscription base has gone down from the previous year. Our falling subscription  base is a cause for concern. Is it because the journal does not address  potential readers' interests? We have been trying to address the question of  what our potential readers want, and welcome readers' comments and  contributions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is it because we are lax in our administrative follow-up of renewals? Most of  the journal's work done on a voluntary basis, much of it from members' own  offices and homes. As a result, work important to the organisation's growth  sometimes gets put aside till time and resources can be found. We are now  trying actively to raise funds and hope that this enables more efficient  functioning of the organisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is our site 'cannibalising' into our subscription base? As a result of a  massive effort this last year, our site, www.medicalethicsindia.org, contains  all back issues of the journal. We decided after some discussion not to  restrict access to the site's contents even if a few people choose not to  subscribe because of its availability on the internet. We believe that a  journal of this type should reach as many people as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					This last year has seen a spurt in activities. Besides developing the site, and  a CD, our members have also participated in a number of discussions on medical  ethics, and organised workshops on the subject. We are in the process of  establishing links with other organisations in the region. We have many more  plans for the coming year. However, we depend on the support and involvement of  all those interested in the subject, if we are to succeed in our goals.
