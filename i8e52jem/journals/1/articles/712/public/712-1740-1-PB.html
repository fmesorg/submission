				<h4>Can sex selection be ethically tolerated? Prohibition on sex
				selection may well be unnecessary and oppressive as well as
				posing risks to women's lives. BM Dickens.J Med Ethics 2002;
				28: 335-336.</h4>
				<p>
					The urge to select children's sex is not new and may be traced
					back to the Sth century. Effective pre-natal determination
					of gender through amniocentesis became available in
					1 970s. Decriminalisation of abortion afforded choice about
					continuation of pregnancy. Recently preimplantation genetic
					diagnosis (PGD) eliminated the need for abortion for gender
					selection, and improved techniques of sperm sorting have
					ensured the sex of the foetus. These new techniques make preselection
					of gender acceptable to those opposed to abortion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Availability of biomedical means to select the sex of future
					children has been accompanied by fears that such means
					will be employed to favour births of sons, and so perpetuate
					devaluation of daughters. A reaction to this fear has been the
					demand for legal sanctions against sex selection techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					In light of decreasing sex (F:M) ratios in India, China, and other
					countries where son preference is predominant, many have
					envisioned the use of techniques of sex selection only as
					reinforcing male domination.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many feminists consider choice in abortion to underpin
					women's self determination. "most feminists resist attempts to
					offer general rules for determining when abortion is justified .... ,
					and most feminists agree that women must gain full control
					over their own reproductive lives if they are to free themselves
					from male dominance."
				</p>
				<p>
					A 1993 Canadian Royal Commission on New Reproductive
					Technologies reported that a desire to balance the family
					was the major motive behind gender pre-selection in
					Canada. Nevertheless, invoking perceived feminist values, the
					commissioners recommended criminalisation of the use of sex
					selection techniques. This was incorporated in a law, comparable
					to the 19941ndian law, introduced in May 2002 in Canada.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the intention of a couple with a child of one sex to
					have another child of the other sex is a sexual but not a sexist
					preference. To suppose that any such choice is necessarily sexist
					is unjust, and to base laws introducing criminal penalties on
					such a supposition where the evidence that an assumption of
					"a pro-male bias ... appears to be unfounded" is both unjust and
					oppressive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until sexist Indian society remedies its son preference, the
					prohibition of sex selection predominantly burdens women's
					lives. If wives cannot resist demands that they deliver sons, they
					have to bear successive pregnancies until they do. Early marriage
					and a quick succession of pregnancies contribute significantly
					to the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity. A World Health
					Organisation (WHO) report notes "the disturbing statistics of
					maternal mortality for developing countries, where women
					are more than 400 times more likely to die from complications
					during pregnancy (than) women in Southern Europe:The risk
					to unplanned girl children is of early death due to infanticide,
					malnutrition, or neglect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Attempts to end son preference by prohibition of sex selection
					are failing in India, and, on their own, do not relieve sex bias. Sex
					bias must be tackled at more fundamental social, economic,
					political, and legal levels. Prohibitions are unnecessary and
					oppressive where there is no sex bias but only a wish to balance
					a family with children of both sexes. Where bias remains,
					prohibitions pose risks to women's and girl children's lives and
					health.

				<h4>Commentary</h4>
				<p>
					The article raises important Issues about individual autonomy
					and society's need to have a balanced population. "Political
					correctness" compels countries to enact laws which severely
					limit individual choice even when there is no demographic
					need to do so, as in Canada.
				</p>
				<p>
					Does the government have a legitimate interest in limiting
					population?
				</p>
				<p>
					Those of us born before 1950 represent the first generation to
					witness a doubling of the world population in their life time.
					According to a 1998 World Watch Institute Report <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beyond Malthus: Sixteen dimensions of the population problem. Brown LR et al Worldwatch paper 143. Sept 1998. www.worldwatch.o1g/pubs/ paper/143 (Accessed on December 19, 2004)." id="1">(1)</a>, the
					progressively declining per capita arable land and depletion of
					the aquifer around the world from overuse are likely to further
					reduce per capita grain production and lead to widespread
					malnutrition, particularly in the socio-economic underclass.
					Clearly, most governments need to control population growth.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we accept that governments have a legitimate interest in
					managing population size, then managing family size follows.
					The more prosperous families readily adopt this philosophy.
					Limiting the number of children allows a family to provide
					better nutrition, education and other resources to each child. As
					the economic status of the family improves, particularly when the wife is also educated and gainfully employed, families tend
					to get smaller. Thus, in India today, many, if not most, middle
					and upper-middle class families have only one or two children.
					This desire to limit family size coupled with preference for a
					male child, has increased the use of medical technology for sex
					selection among the well-to-do.
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast, this rationale to balance the family and also to limit
					family size does not appeal to a poor family. In the absence of
					government-supported social security, sons make the best
					survival strategy for poor families, providing current economic
					advantage and old-age security. Daughters may contribute
					to the family's earnings now but have to be married off with
					dowries that drain family resources and once they are part
					of the husbands' families, they can rarely provide security to
					parents as they age. Prof Ashish Bose, a leading demographer,
					thinks "the government's two-child norm and female foeticide
					have gotten mixed up" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gurung M. "The two-child norm only leads to female foeticide" www. infochangeindia.org/analysis47.jsp (Accessed on December 19, 2004)." id="2">(2)</a>. The slogan 'Hum do hamare do'
					yields three possibilities - two sons, two daughters, or one son
					and one daughter. Two daughters are culturally unacceptable,
					and while one son and one daughter are tolerable, the ideal
					situation people strive for is two sons <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gurung M. "The two-child norm only leads to female foeticide" www. infochangeindia.org/analysis47.jsp (Accessed on December 19, 2004)." id="2">(2)</a>. Prof Bose feels that if
					the policy were relaxed, there would be fewer female foeticides.
					But it is equally likely that even if the government were to relax
					its two-child norm, poor families may still want all boys for even
					greater security, keeping the sex ratio skewed with a higher
					population.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without addressing the underlying cause for sex
					predetermination services, putting the entire focus for the
					declining sex ratio on the medical profession alone is erroneous
					and counterproductive. Even before the 1980s when sex
					determination through amniocentesis became easily available,
					families expressed their son preference through female
					infanticide or deliberate neglect of girl children's nutrition and
					health, leading to greater mortality of females in the 1-6 year
					group. These practices are even crueler than sex determination
					and abortion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps,amniocentesis and abortion are morally less repugnant
					than neglect or murder. This may have contributed to the decline
					of the sex ratio over the last decade. Once a technology is widely
					known and available, it is very difficult to prevent its use. If the
					technology is outlawed, people will find ways to circumvent the
					act -like asking for amniocentesis for medical reasons (spurious
					hereditary diseases, fictitious complications in early pregnancy, etc) and abortions may move from safe environments to
					back-alley practitioners resulting in an even higher maternal
					mortality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is banning amniocentesis and abortion of female foetuses the
					only way to reverse the declining sex ratio?
				</p>
				<p>
					Rather than banning PGDor amniocentesis for sex determination
					followed by abortion, can we not try to put in checks and
					balances? The government could make these procedures
					available at little or no cost in government facilities to poor
					families who want to limit their family size as well as balance
					their family. Private facilities for the well-to-do would have to
					follow the same rule of offering it only for the sex determination
					of the second child. Additionally, heavy monetary penalties
					for the families as well as physicians, who misuse the test to
					have male children only, would be a deterrent. This could be
					combined with imaginative use of "carrots" to improve the sex
					ratio. For poor families, a monthly rice subsidy for every girl child
					that remains in school- as in Bangladesh <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gurung M. "The two-child norm only leads to female foeticide" www. infochangeindia.org/analysis47.jsp (Accessed on December 19, 2004)." id="2">(2)</a>- may be attractive
					enough to have at least one girl for every boy in the family. For
					the more well-to do, a different "carrot" may be needed, such as
					preference in college admission, jobs, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is another ethical dilemma to be considered. Should
					society's need for a greater number of women be fulfilled at the
					cost of an individual woman's desire to determine the sex of her
					child?
				</p>
				<p>
					How do we justify the forced carrying to term of an unwanted
					female foetus who will continue to suffer emotional and physical
					deprivation as an unwanted child all her life? Why must hundreds
					of thousands of women and their female children suffer now so
					that Indian society has the requisite sex ratio today? Why can't
					we wait for improved education and economic status to balance
					the sex ratio over the next 50 years?
				</p>
				<p>
					China was unwilling to wait for its population to decline at a
					slow rate so it imposed what most considered an inhuman law
					limiting couples to just one child. Is forced carrying to term of a
					female child any less inhuman?
