				<h4>Mazur D.J. Influence of the law on risk and informed
				consent. BMJ 2003;327:731&ndash;5</h4>
				<p>
					Obtaining  informed consent is now a routine part of both clinical practice and research,  but the focus on giving information about risk has evolved differently in  clinical and research settings. The law has played a large part in informed  consent in clinical practice. Consent in clinical research has been codified in  international regulations.

				<h4>Informed  consent related to clinical care has evolved through legal cases</h4>
				<p>
					In  clinical care, disclosure of risk developed from the obligation on doctors to  obtain their patients' consent before intervening medically. Gradually the  notion of consent evolved into informed consent, with the emphasis being on  information about risks. The professional standard of consent to treatment has  been espoused as a judicial concept since a British case in 1767 in which the  physician initially set the patient's femoral fracture in accordance with  practice at that time but at a follow up visit re-broke the healing fracture  and placed the re-broken bone in a newly invented mechanical device with teeth.  The judge concluded that obtaining a patient's consent was a custom of  physicians and ruled for the patient that consent should have been obtained by  the physician as part of his professional duties. Thus consent was judged under  'professional standard of behaviour'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much  later, the notion of information became linked to consent. The term 'informed  consent' was first introduced into the judicial lexicon in 1957 in the written  opinion of an appellate court judge in California and a new judicial  standard-the reasonable person standard-was established by Judge Robinson in  1972 whereby the decision about whether a patient should have been informed of  a risk is based on whether a reasonable person in that patient's position would  want to be informed. Many countries have adopted this standard or are moving  towards it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  primary use of the concept of informed consent in the courts is in  retrospective decision-making after an injury. Only derivatively is informed  consent a prospective view on what a physician should say to a patient. Indeed,  court views of informed consent also include a therapeutic privilege for  physicians not to inform a patient who may be harmed by the disclosed  information.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a  patient makes an explicit instruction not to be told of risks, this request  should be honoured. However, the question remains whether family members or  partners should be informed if the patient does not want to be told about  risks. Cultural issues may also arise, for example, in Japan, the cultural  practice has been not to inform a patient that he or she has a terminal  illness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  courts, however, require information to be disclosed to the patient in a  discussion with the physician. Thus, simply handing patients a consent form may  not be considered enough by the courts unless the issues are discussed with  patients and they have an opportunity to ask further questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  issue is the fact that much of the discussion of risks of invasive procedures  still takes places when the patient is admitted for the intervention. Informed  consent in clinical care in the US is usually obtained by the physician  performing the procedure. But the hospital also has a role in overseeing  informed consent.

				<h4>Informed  consent in clinical research is more regulated and requires more a structured  approach to disclosing risk information</h4>
				<p>
					The  Declaration of Helsinki forms an important basis for the conduct of research in  humans. The Belmont report <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Belmont report: ethical guidelines for the protection of human subjects of research. Washington, DC: DHEW Publications, 1978, http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/mpa/belmont.php3 (accessed August 21, 2003)." id="1">(1)</a> rejects the 'professional standard' and  'reasonable person standard' and instead recommends the use of the 'reasonable  volunteer standard'. The need for patients to fully understand is greater in  clinical research because participation is voluntary, alternatives may exist,  and the participant may not benefit and could be harmed by participation. As a  result, more emphasis has been put on detailing information that must be  disclosed to people considering participating in a clinical study. Informed  consent forms contain an increasing array of information. The US Code of  Federal Regulations also specifies vulnerable groups who need extra protection  because the potential for their unethical use in research. These groups include  children, prisoners, pregnant women, and people who are mentally disabled,  economically or educationally disadvantaged. Clearly, the concern is that these  groups may not fully understand the nature of research and the fact that  research is not clinical care.

				<h4>Judicial  view does not provide an inclusive enough for communicating risks and  alternatives</h4>
				<p>
					The  judicial system has played an important role in developing informed consent.  However, it cannot provide an all-inclusive framework for the multiple problems  that exist in communicating information about risk for all the circumstances  that physicians are confronted with in the real world. We need to bring in  perspectives from cognitive psychology, the decision-making sciences, and  consumers to help clinicians overcome a broader range of conversational  dilemmas.

				<h4>Commentary</h4>
				<p>
					Informed  consent became an integral part of clinical practice in the 1970s. Initially,  informed consent was taken more for a perceived legal protection than with the  intent to provide information to the patient. This created some farcical  situations. In 1973, while I was a fellow at Cook County Hospital in Chicago,  the hospital administration decreed that the then current three or four patient  consent forms for invasive procedures would be replaced by more than 70 forms,  each designed for a specific clinical setting. Thus there were forms for  performing a history and physical examination, for starting an intravenous  infusion, for transfusions, a special one for biopsy of each organ etc. This  flurry of legal activity was clearly precipitated by the 1972 California  decision referred to in the above article. The hospital administration,  inexperienced in the nuances of tort law, overreacted. A lot of attention was  placed on the form and not the substance of the law.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  academic medicine, as teaching of medical ethics became formalized, starting in  the 1970s, moral principles of respect for autonomy (the obligation to respect  the decision-making capacities of autonomous persons); non-malfeasance (the  obligation to avoid causing harm); beneficence (obligations to provide benefits  and to balance benefits against risks): and justice (obligations of fairness in  the distribution of benefits and risks), enunciated by Thomas Beauchamp and  Daniel Callahan, assumed a central role.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirty  years later, informed consent is still written with the intent to protect the  medical profession from lawsuits. Partly, this results from the fact that  informed consent becomes an issue only in retrospect, as the above article  points out. However, the law cannot script the consent as it has scripted the  Miranda warning given by the arresting officer to a suspect-every word is  loaded with meaning and shortening the recitation can invalidate the arrest.  Therefore, what should be included in an informed consent is still a matter for  debate and research. It is important to convey the probability of success in  simple language and, to point out the element of uncertainty, without scaring  the patient. The language should avoid medical jargon. In the USA, the form  must be readable and understandable to a person who has studied up to the sixth  grade. In India, where the majority possess only rudiments of literacy, the  language would have to be even simpler. Perhaps, pictures would be more  effective than words in conveying what procedure is being planned.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  often assume that resources are infinite and every patient has a right to  decide and get any procedure done that is deemed necessary. But, as we know,  and as pointed out by Professor Bloche <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gregg BM. Rights and efficiency in American health law. Human Rights: Journal of the Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities 1998;25:19." id="2">(2)</a>, in many clinical situations, each  choice is accompanied by substantial monetary and social costs that are ignored  by clinicians when discussing therapeutic options. Should these not be spelled  out and be a part of the consent process? Should discussions involving  allocation of scarce family financial resources or assumption of  responsibilities by other family members remain a matter for family dynamics  and not be 'medicalised' by being included in the consent process? Should the  family become involved only when there is cognitive impairment? In India, a  patient often lets someone else make decisions for care, then, should this  surrogate sign the form in addition to the patient?
				</p>
				<p>
					A great  deal needs to be learned about the content of the 'informed consent' form, the  ways to explain the intricacies of risk in modern medicine, the psychosocial  processes involved in decision-making, before we can be rest assured that a  truly informed patient has made a wise decision.
