				<h4>Banned formulations</h4>
				<p>
					The government of India  has banned certain combinations of medicines as being non- rational and one  among them is a fixed-dose combination of dextropropoxyphene with any other  drug other than anti-spasmodics and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs).
				</p>
				<p>
					I came across two  formulations being sold under brand names Spasmo-Proxyvon and Buta-Proxyvon  which contain Acetaminophen/Paracetamol which is being termed as an NSAID and  my investigation shows that acetaminophen is anti-pyretic and analgesic and  not NSAID. Thus, I feel these two brands belong in the banned category of formulations  and the medical fraternity should exercise utmost caution prescribing this  combination. According to the drugs controller for Karnataka, acetaminophen is  basically an anagesic/antipyretic, its anti inflammatory property is weak and  seldom clinically useful and hence it cannot be classifed as an  antiinflammatory drug under the category NSAID.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, Indian  Pharmacopoeia 1996, an authentic reference published by the ministry of health  and family welfare, government of India, has classified it as an analgesic,  antipyretic, and not as NSAID.
