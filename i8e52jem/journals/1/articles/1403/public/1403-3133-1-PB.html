					When someone seriously  proposes that the UK National Health Service (NHS) could be saved 'from  collapse' by flying patients abroad for cheaper operations, you know  something's wrong with the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Former welfare reform minister and Labour MP Frank Field recently said in an  interview with the BBC, "If you look at India for example, you could fly out a  patient, fly out a relative, give an operation to someone local and still be  quids in." Some patients have already been known to fly to India for cataract  operations since they could not wait for their turn in the NHS surgeries, nor  afford private medical attention.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Charles Webster, a historian of the NHS, the following description  seemed to hold as true of 1958 as for 1997: "Maldistribution of resources,  capital investment an urgent priority, poor administrative integration and  discontents about pay." In spite of these problems, the NHS continued to be  seen as something of a national icon. The Tory government ignored the strong  links drawn by Labour between poverty and ill health, thus leading to a shift  to a market-driven NHS in the late 1970s. Webster demonstrates further that  during this period, the health department was low priority in terms of funding,  leading to a failure to maintain even a constant level of service.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, the situation is graver. A person accessing the NHS at almost any level  faces delays. A routine appointment with a GP can take up to 4-5 days and the  result for a blood test up to a fortnight. Figures indicate that patients wait  up to seven months for a cataract operation. The alternative to the NHS in the  UK is exorbitantly priced private care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lack of planning for foreseeable emergencies is another issue. In the  winter of 1999-2000, the 'flu epidemic put the already stressed NHS to test,  which it could not easily cope with. Several surgeries, fixed in advance, had  to be cancelled. According to Christine Hannock, General Secretary, Royal  College of Nursing, "We know that winter comes every year and we know that it's  a pressure. We shouldn't be cancelling elective surgery in January, we  shouldn't be booking elective surgery in January."
				</p>
				<p>
					At another level, the NHS depends to a large extent on a knowledge of the way  it works. According to Heather Goodare, chairperson of the research committee  of the UK Breast Cancer Coalition, the fact that the NHS is there, and is free,  means much for the people. However, "it is so dependent on knowing your way  around the system. Why is the NHS so often a lottery? Why can a badger get a CT  scan when people with cancer have to wait weeks? Why do inpatients starve  because there is no one to help them eat?"
				</p>
				<p>
					None of these are issues of organisation alone. Failure to access health  services due to bad planning, or poor communication skills in the actors in the  system indicate that ethical considerations of helping maintain a viable and  working health system are not prioritised by health planners. The general lack  of respect attached to the NHS is reflected in the nursing crisis. There is a  shortage of new recruits. A part of the problem is the low wages given to  nurses. Even with the revision in pay of about 4.7 per cent in1999, and the announcement  of a special allowance to those working in London, the remuneration given to  nurses remains low and the work arduous.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nurses have complained of not being treated with respect. The efforts by the  NHS to save the situation have been seen as too little, too late. A severe  shortage of nurses at Royal Free Hospital in London has led to a situation  where operations have been cancelled and emergency patients have been forced to  wait as long as 36 hours for beds and attention. There is a vacancy of almost 350  nurses in that hospital, and efforts have been made to recruit nurses from the  Middle East.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Blair government has faced some flak about the malfunctioning in the NHS.  The popular view is that the situation is caused by financial crisis, and  increasing demands by the people. Peter Davies, General practitioner principal,  has this to say, "In a private industry in which payment is made for each  service this demand would generate extra profits for a company. In a cash-limited service, extra demand will generate strain on the resources and result  in anguish and disappointment for doctors and patients alike. This friction  between demand and resources is reaching a head. Without a reduction in demand  or without extra funding I see only disappointment and stress for patients,  doctors, managers, and politicians."
				</p>
				<p>
					The argument is that privatisation can cure the NHS of its malaise. A Better  State of Health by John Willman argues that the relationship between doctors  and patients may improve and health services become more efficient if patients  pay a modest charge every time they consult a doctor. Willman suggests that a  charge will make sure that patients do not waste the doctor's time for trivial  complaints.
				</p>
				<p>
					This analysis, however,  seems somewhat flawed. In the first place, few patients go to their GP for  trivial complaints, as the waiting period for an ordinary appointment is fairly  long. More seriously, the issue of doctors being patronising to patients is  surely more complex than that of payment -it is inherent in the nature of the  relationship that allows some degree of condescension to be built in. Finally,  while a financial crunch may be an issue plaguing the NHS, the more significant  issue is that of shortage of staff. The medical profession, especially at the  nursing level is simply not attractive enough to attract recruits. It is  difficult to see how privatisation will help to tackle that. What privatisation  may do is to raise the costs of medical care so that more and more people in  the country are prevented access to it.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the level of ethical considerations, it may be important to look at the  consequences that the proposal to send patients from UK to countries like  India. It would certainly increase pressure on the already pressurised health  systems in India, and can potentially lead to depriving Indians of essential  services. At another level, the proposal to use the 'cheaper' medical  facilities of the third world and fund the operation of one 'local' is  uncomfortably reminiscent of colonial exploitation and patronage. While the NHS  may be 'saved' by these steps, it will certainly endanger health systems in  India.
