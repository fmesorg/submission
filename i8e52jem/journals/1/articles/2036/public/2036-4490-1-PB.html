				<h4>Treating patients with HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Your issue on treating  people with HIV discusses a very important subject. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Health professionals and HIV. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 79-95." id="1">(1)</a> I started my medical  career around the time that HIV was first detected. My first personal encounter  with the disease was some years ago, when a fellow physician and personal friend  was diagnosed as HIV positive. The problems in treating a HIV positive patient  were becoming clear at the time. Unfortunately, they remain the same today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even well-off people  with HIV find it difficult to continue treatment in the long term. For others,  it is just impossible. This is true even after the costs of drugs has come  down. Only one of the 300 or so patients I have treated could afford HAART  therapy (three drugs including a protease inhibitor). Therapy must often be  administered to an entire family. Monitoring tests are also expensive. Add to  this the loss of pay for patient and attendants. Other problems: the family is  stigmatised, immunodeficient people in the hospital are at risk of infection  from nearby patients and passing resistant infections to others, and health  professionals are given inadequate protection against infections of all sorts.
