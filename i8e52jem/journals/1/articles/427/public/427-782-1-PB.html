<h3>Assessment of mental capacity in patients recruited in clinical trials in psychiatry and its relationship to informed consent</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Rajesh Jacob, Arabinda N Chowdhary</h4>

			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Insufficient attention is paid to the need for assessing the mental
					capacity of participants in clinical trials, particularly those in
					psychiatry. Assessment of mental capacity is paramount especially
					in patients suffering from certain brain disorders and psychiatric
					illnesses, as lack of capacity can invalidate the consent given.
					Suggested below is a framework for assessing mental capacity in
					a systematic way with the hope that those writing on the subject
					of clinical research give it due mportance.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Publications on clinical drug trials in India rarely mention any
					assessment of the mental capacity of patients taking part in
					the trials. Informed consent is generally mentioned, with a
					majority of patients being seen to give such consent, while in
					some patients mentally incapable of giving consent, consent
					is obtained from relatives <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jacob A, Tharyan P, Adams C, John T, Mol C, Philip J. Rapid tranquilisation of violent or agitated patients in a psychiatric emergency setting. A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of intramuscular Lorazepam v Haloperidol plus Promethazine.Br J Pychiatry 2004; 185: 63-9." id="1">(1)</a> This is of particular relevance
					to clinical drug trials for psychiatric disorders. Systematic
					assessment of mental capacity is essential in psychiatric
					disorders such as acute mania, acute psychosis, schizophrenic
					illnesses with florid psychotic symptoms, where capacity may
					be impaired thus invalidating informed consent obtained from
					these patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					There has been significant discussion and controversy about
					an article published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 2005
					of a randomised placebo controlled trial in acute mania <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Khanna S, Vieta E, Lyons B, Eerdekens M, Kramer M. Risperidone in the treatment of acute mania; a double blind placebo controlled study. Br J Pychiatry 2005; 187:229-34." id="2">(2)</a>. This
					article has already been discussed at length in a previous issue
					of this journal <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patel V. Ethics of a placebo controlled trial in severe mania. Ind J Med Ethics 2006 Jan-Mar;3(1):10-1." id="3">(3</a>,<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P.

Ind J Med Ethics 2006 Jan-Mar;3(1):17-8." id="5">5)</a>. There was no mention of any assessment
					of the mental capacity of the patients but signed informed
					consent was obtained from all those patients who were acutely
					ill and suffering from a manic episode requiring hospitalisation.
					This led to questions being asked about the validity of the
					informed consent obtained.
				</p>
				<p>
					The standard framework of informed consent (Table 1) makes it
					clear that gaining informed consent from research participants
					is an ongoing ethical issue <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Royal College of Nursing. Informed consent in health and social care research. 2005, Royal College of Nursing, London." id="6">(6)</a> and at each point involves the
					participant's mental capacity for valid consent.
				</p>

				<h4>Informed consent framework</h4>
		<p> Potential participants need to understand the following issues: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Purpose of the research
					</li>
					<li>
						Practicalities and procedures involved in participation
					</li>
					<li>
						Benefits and risks of participation, if appropriate, the    alternative therapies
					</li>
					<li>
						Details of data management and use
					</li>
					<li>
						The role of the participant if he/she agrees in the research
					</li>
					<li>
						Consent form
					</li>
					<li>
						How information will be provided to them throughout the study
					</li>
					<li>
						That their participation is voluntary
					</li>
					<li>
						That they can withdraw from the study at any time, without
						giving any reason and without compromising their future
						treatment
					</li>
					<li>
						The insurance indemnity where appropriate
					</li>
					<li>
						That the research is approved by research ethics committee

					</li>
					<li>
						Contact details should they have further questions or wish
						to withdraw

					</li>
					<li>
						Details of the research sponsor or research funding body.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Informed consent is an ongoing requirement so it must
					be ensured that participants continue to understand the
					information above and any changes in that information and
					continue to consent to participate throughout the study.
				</p>

				<p>
					Even patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are
					rarely assessed for their mental capacity in a systematic fashion,
					though consent for the treatment is obtained from them or
					their relatives. This issue has been addressed in a recent article
					by Rajkumar et al from Christian Medical College, Vellore,
					and published in this journal in 2007 along with a specially
					designed ECT fact sheet-a welcome step that needs to be
					uniformly adopted across the country <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajkumar AP, Saravanan B, Jacob KS. Voices of people who have received ECT. Indian J Med Ethics 2007; 4: 3-7." id="7">(7)</a>.

				<p>
					In the United Kingdom, the Mental Capacity Act (2005), which
					became operational in 2007, mandates punishments, including
					imprisonment, for people who mistreat persons who lack

					capacity <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mental Capacity Act 2005 United Kingdom. Office of the Public Sector information. Available from: http://www.opsi.gov.uk." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some steps must be taken to assess the mental capacity of
					patients before they are recruited into clinical trials, as well as
					during the research. This is especially necessary in psychiatry.
					We detail these steps below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="seciton">
				<h4>Assessment of mental capacity</h4>
				<p>
					What is mental capacity? Mental capacity is the ability to
					make a decision. Capacity can only be assessed in relation to
					a particular decision and a particular time - a person may have the capacity to make some decisions but not others, or the capacity may vary over time.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						A person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the
						material time he is unable to make a decision for himself
						because of an impairment of, or disturbance in, the
						functioning of the mind or brain.
					</li>

					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							The incapacity could be caused by mental illness, learning
							disability, brain damage, dementia or any other cause.
						</li>
						<li>
							Although capacity is presumed, any issue as to whether a
							person lacks capacity must be decided on the balance of
							probabilities.
						</li>
						<li>
							The impairment or disturbance may be permanent or
							temporary.
						</li>
						<li>
							Assessment of mental capacity is a decision specific test. It
							will not be possible to label any person as lacking capacity
							solely as a result of a particular medical diagnosis.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						A person will be judged unable to make a decision for
						herself if he/she is unable
					</li>

					<ol type="a">

						<li>
							To understand the necessary information
						</li>
						<li>
							To retain that information
						</li>
						<li>
							To use it as a part of a decision making process
						</li>
						<li>
							To communicate her decision by any appropriate means.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						The following should be noted (test for capacity):
					</li>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							The requirement for the person to "understand" must
							include understanding an explanation of the information
							when provided in a way that is appropriate to that person's
							circumstances, as for example using simple language or
							visual aids.
						</li>
						<li>
							Short term retention of the information should not be
							assumed to prevent a person from being regarded as unable
							to make a decision.
						</li>
						<li>
							Information includes knowing the reasonably foreseeable
							consequences of the decision or when to take it.
						</li>
						<li>
							The more serious the decision to be made the greater the
							test and the greater the responsibility of those involved.
						</li>
						<li>
							The person's age, appearance, condition or behaviour does
							not by itself establish that the person lacks capacity.
						</li>
						<li>
							The person who assesses the capacity is the person who
							is responsible for making the decision or taking the action
							after consultation and if necessary having obtained
							appropriate advice.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>

				<p>
					There should be a formal assessment of mental capacity of all
					patients entering clinical trials before consent is obtained. Also,
					all published clinical trials should show the exact percentage of
					patients giving consent as well as the percentage of relatives
					giving consent. It is a common practice in clinical trials done in
					India to obtain consent from relatives if patients are incapable
					of giving consent. This is ethically questionable and needs
					to be debated in a larger context. In the western world, no
					clinical trials can proceed and receive ethical approval with the
					consent of relatives alone <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department of Health, UK 12 key points on consent: the law in England. London: 2001." id="9">(9)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of 'delayed consent' in emergency situations (for
					example an accident, cardiac arrest, emergency admission)
					or 'consent by proxy' (in cases of children, dementia or other
					cognitive impairment, learning disabilities or mental illness) are
					notable provisions in the ethical/legal framework available in
					western countries but no such statutory framework is available
					in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					It should also be borne in mind that capacity can change
					during the course of treatment and patients should have the
					right to refuse interventions in a clinical trial if they regain full
					capacity and do not want to take further part in the trial due
					to an improvement in their illness. A person with capacity has
					every right to make his or her own decisions however wise or
					eccentric the decision may be, or appear to be, to others. To
					prepare for this, clinical trial participants can set up an advance
					directive to make clear what they would like to happen if they
					have a relapse during a trial. If this is set up at the beginning,
					researchers have to stick to this agreement. However,
					researchers may be obligated to give additional treatment if
					this is thought to be necessary to protect the participant from
					harm or reduce his or her pain or discomfort.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Recommendations</h4>
				<p>
					If an assessment of mental capacity of people undergoing
					clinical trials in India was done systematically as prescribed
					above, it would go some way in diffusing the ethical
					controversy surrounding such trials. It would also be helpful
					if editors of journals publishing these trials insist on this
					before accepting the article for publication just as many are
					now insisting on the informed consent provision <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Doyal L. Journals should not publish research to which patients have not given fully informed consent - with three exceptions. BMJ 1997; 314: 1107-11." id="10">(10</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goodare H. Studies that do not have informed consent from participants should not be published. BMJ 1998; 316: 1000-5." id="11">11)</a>. Full
					assessment of mental capacity is paramount, both ethically
					and legally, before valid informed consent can be obtained. This
					good research practice should get proper attention in India if
					our research is to gain wider international acceptance.
