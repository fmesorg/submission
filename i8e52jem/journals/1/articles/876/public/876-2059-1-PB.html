				<h4>Problems with private pathology practice</h4>
				<p>
					I have read the article  entitled 'Why I don't believe in referral commissions' by Arun Sheth <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheth A. Why I don't believe in referral commissions. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:58-59." id="1">(1)</a>. What  struck me as odd about this piece was the fact that we now need to justify the  'right thing to do'. The very fact that doctors who don't give or take 'cuts'  are a minority nowadays speaks badly enough of our 'noble' profession. But that  we now need to find reasons and justifications for doing the proper things is  truly a serious cause for introspection. It appears that a wrong done over and  over again by a large number of people, and highly educated people at that,  soon becomes the order of the day. Hence, doctors who 'don't fall in line' risk  greater marginalisation from the mainstream. They take too long to  establish themselves and some finally just give up and change professions. This  is especially true for people like us who have dependent practices like  pathology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's look at some facts in the pathology 'business'. Technician-run  laboratories are prepared to go to any lengths to secure their 'business'.  Although it is degrading for qualified pathologists to compete with  technicians, there is no other way because even top consultants accept these  reports (sometimes even unsigned ones) from technicians. We even have a few  technicians requesting us to report their peripheral smears or cytologies or  even biopsies which means that even these investigations are sent to  technicians' labs and not to pathologists. The flip side is that when it comes  to the consultant's own relatives or friends they always come to a pathologist  even for the simplest of tests. What's good enough for other patients is not so  for the doctor's kith and kin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consortium-owned labs or group practice set-ups are the 'in' thing. Here,  doctors invest money together in a diagnostic set-up and then send long lists  of investigations for kickbacks and incentives. (From the layperson's point of  view this is viewed as hunting in packs.) I think the main issue here is the  percentage receivable, rather than what is necessary for the patient. It is one  thing to make a project viable, quite another to burden the patient for your  personal gain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then comes the choice of the patient to go to any lab. Due to the nexus that  exists between the clinics and labs, unless a patient comes back with a report  from a particular lab, he is subjected to another battery of tests with the  explanation, 'These tests are wrong; why didn't you go to the other lab?' The  poor patient fears the wrath of the doctor and does as he is told, in the  process compromising his right to choose where he wants to go.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have even heard of places where rickshawallahs and drugstore owners are roped  in to direct patients. This absolutely unethical way of 'soliciting clients'  just proves to what lengths we are now ready to go to succeed in our  profession. It is even more depressing to think how the big reference labs have  affected small private set-ups like mine to compete with their prices,  especially when nobody cares about the quality of reports that these labs have  to offer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, it is becoming very difficult to practise pathology in a clean manner. It  is the patient who is being taken for granted all the time. I have managed so  far to keep myself away from these practices but always get an 'explanation'  from my male colleagues that it's because I am a woman and don't have to  'support' a family. I think we must take steps to create a space for ethical  doctors to be able to earn a living while practising their professions with  dignity and self-respect. In this, I feel the National Accreditation Body for  Laboratories must play an important role and laboratories must be licensed and  accredited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, to those who wish to practise market-medicine, I wish you much  happiness in your endeavours. But remember what Gibbon said: 'The first  and indispensable requisite of happiness is a clear conscience, unsullied by  the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy action.'

				<h4>Audits of electroconvulsive therapy</h4>
				<p>
					Waikar et al. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waikar A, Davar B, Karhadkar C, Bansode D, Dandekar D, Kakade S, Wayal S, Kulkarni Y. ECT without anaesthesia is unethical. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:41-43." id="2">(1)</a>, in  their diatribe against ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) in general, and  unmodified or direct ECT in particular, were shocked that our institutional  ethics committee permitted an 11-year 'study' of unmodified ECT <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214. 3" id="3">(2)</a>, where  patients whose 'fearful refusal of a hazardous and life-threatening procedure'  were 'considered as a mere symptom of insanity, and further treated with  sedatives'. They were appalled that ECT was given to children, elderly and  pregnant women. They contend that our report trivialised the 'horrific'  physical complications with direct ECT and 'the costs of disability days following  ECT'. They wonder 'why presumably rational scientists produce such irrational  arguments to safeguard a scientifically dubious and highly hazardous  procedure', concluding that it is because we 'make a lot of money by giving  ECT'.
				</p>
				<p>
					ECT is an invasive procedure,  like neurosurgery, and considerations of morbidity or mortality must therefore  be viewed in this context. Untreated or treatment refractory mental illness  kills and wastes precious lives. There is incontrovertible evidence that ECT is  an effective treatment for depression <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The UK ECT Review Group. Efficacy and safety of electroconvulsive therapy in depressive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Electroconvulsive therapy for schizophrenia. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2002;(2):CD000076" id="6">(5)</a>, especially when other treatments  fail. There is no credible evidence that ECT causes brain damage <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Devanand DP, Dwork AJ, Hutchinson ER, Bolwig TG, Sackeim HA. Does ECT alter brain structure? Am J Psychiatry 1994;151:957-970." id="7">(6)</a>. ECT is  not contraindicated, and may be especially effective, in pregnant women,  children or the elderly <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="American Psychiatric Association. The practice of electroconvulsive therapy: recommendations for treatment, training and privileging. Task force report on ECT. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2001." id="8">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ours was not a  prospective research study but a retrospective chart audit of clinical practice <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214. 3" id="3">(2)</a>. Over 11 years, 6.3% of the 28,929 patients registered at our centre were  treated with ECT, hardly the overenthusiastic and indiscriminate use implied by  Waikar et al. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waikar A, Davar B, Karhadkar C, Bansode D, Dandekar D, Kakade S, Wayal S, Kulkarni Y. ECT without anaesthesia is unethical. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:41-43." id="2">(1)</a>. Of the 13,597 individual treatments given to 1,835 patients,  the physical morbidity included spinal compression fractures and transient  myalgia in less than 1%, resulting in short-lived pain but no disability,  neurological deficits or long-term sequelae over up to 8 years follow-up. One  patient died (mortality rate 0.05%) of a cardiac arrhythmia, though the  subsequent 12 years and approximately 2,000 additional patients treated have  not seen additional mortality.
				</p>
				<p>
					In spite of this low  complication rate for an invasive procedure, all treatment conducted here since  1995 have been modified under anaesthetic supervision, and our practice,  frequently audited, conforms to the international technical and ethical  standards. No patient has ever received ECT without personally (or a  responsible relative) consenting. Fear of ECT is less with modified than  with unmodified ECT but in both situations an unknown and reputedly hazardous procedure  does generate apprehension, just as with tooth extraction or brain surgery.  Pre-ECT sedation reduces apprehension. ECT, as practised in our centre, is  hardly a lucrative enterprise since costs are low (Rs 180 per modified  treatment, excluding anaesthetic drug costs) and many patients' treatments are  free or heavily subsidised. Finally, our patients and their relatives have  endorsed our use of ECT <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prashanth NR. Attitudes of psychiatric patients and their relatives towards informed consent for electroconvulsive therapy. MD Dissertation. The Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University, 1998." id="9">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unmodified ECT is aesthetically less appealing to patients and clinicians alike  than modified ECT. Consideration of ways to phase out direct ECT such as  changing from thrice a week to the equally effective twice a week regimen to  reduce anaesthetist demand, or forming group practices with shared ECT and  anaesthetic facilities, or deputing psychiatric personnel to get specialist  anaesthetic training are inevitable, if ECT is to survive another 50 years.  However, banning direct ECT overnight by legal action without ensuring the  continued and effective delivery of ECT is tantamount to closing down mental hospitals  without ensuring adequate community care. Many clinicians, without access to  anaesthetists, would face denying seriously mentally ill patients an effective  treatment. Such a 'collateral damage' resulting from well-intentioned action is  as unethical and unacceptable as some recent international events.

				<h4>Unmodified ECT vs  modified ECT</h4>
				<p>
					This letter refers to the article by Chittaranjan Andrade  regarding the use of unmodified ECT <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:9-10." id="10">(1)</a>. The author has discussed the obvious  advantages of modified ECT over unmodified ECT. He also highlights the ground  realities and difficulties in practice of modified ECT. The author concludes  that the use of unmodified ECT may be preferable to no ECT, as in the case when  ECT is indicated but anaesthesiological facilities are unavailable or unaffordable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though I agree in  principle with the points raised and this discussion may be scientifically  correct, we need to know the views of the people who are going to be recipients  of such treatment. It has been seen that doctors show remarkably little  interest in their patients' views of the procedure and its effects on them <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abrams R. Patients attitudes, legal-regulatory issues, and informed consent. In: Abrams R (ed). Electroconvulsive therapy. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997." id="11">(2)</a>.  I think that in this discussion on the ethical issues of administering  unmodified ECT, a patient's perspective is not being considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though no data are  available, most of the patients who refuse ECT do so because of the fear  associated with the procedure. This fear may be attributed to the gruesome and  barbaric picture of ECT projected by the media in which patients are shown  screaming and refusing ECT and later on convulsing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The use of unmodified  ECT would only increase this fear and lead to rejection and disrepute of this  really effective modality of treatment for psychiatric disorders at the hands  of the media and anti-ECT lobbies.

				<h4>Unmodified ECT: what is the patient's perspective?</h4>
				<p>
					Raval has correctly  indicated that, when prescribing a treatment, it is necessary to be aware of  the views of the recipients of the treatment. There is much literature on  patients' experiences with and attitudes towards modified ECT in developed  countries <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freeman CPL, Kendell RE. ECT: Patients' experiences and attitudes to ECT. J Psychiatry 1980;137:8-16." id="13">(1,</a><a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Benbow SM. Patients' views on electroconvulsive therapy on completion of a course of treatment. Convulsive Ther 1988;4:146-152." id="14">2)</a> as well as in India <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Mariadas B, Kalanidhi K, Reddy MV. Patients' knowledge about and attitudes towards ECT. Paper presented at the 45th Annual National Conference of the Indian Psychiatric Society, Lucknow, 1993." id="15">(3)</a>. There is, unhappily, no literature at  all on patients' experiences with and attitudes towards unmodified ECT in any  part of the world; in fact, it is uncertain whether, today, unmodified ECT is  indeed practised in any other country!
				</p>
				<p>
					Data on the subject should help form a more sound judgement about unmodified  ECT. Unfortunately, such data are best obtained only through a study in which  patients are randomised to receive either modified or unmodified ECT. If the  data were to be obtained in any other way, adherents of unmodified ECT would  claim that, in the absence of a control group, the experiences and attitudes  documented merely reflect experiences with and attitudes towards ECT in  general.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raval additionally suggests that the practice of unmodified ECT may fuel the  fears of patients who see ECT portrayed as a gruesome and barbaric treatment by  the visual mass media. With apologies to Shakespeare, the fault, dear Brutus,  lies not in unmodified ECT, but in its distorted portrayal. For example, an  open heart surgery is well known to result in short- and long-term cognitive  deficits; if the mass media were to use this knowledge to vilify open  heart surgery, would it be justifiable to abandon the procedure? Sadly, in  expressing his opinion, Raval is actually right. The strongest case for the  abandonment of unmodified ECT is that its continued use may provide grist to  the mill of publicity-hungry, self-important civil rights activists and  sensationalistic film producers, and thereby jeopardise the survival of ECT  itself.

				<h4>'Bust  oil' and other bogus claims</h4>
				<p>
					Irrational, useless and  even dangerous drugs flood the market. A certain company's rubs and iodide  products for local application do business worth crores of rupees every year in  India. Both multinational and Indian companies are involved in such practices.  Since we do not raise objections, the manufacturers keep pushing new products  to cheat consumers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, these tricks were restricted to what was sold as medicines.  Recently, cosmetic products have been launched with advertisements that make  false claims. Though vitamin E is not absorbed through the skin, soaps, creams,  oils and lotions advertise vitamin E as an ingredient. Hair is just a dead  extension of the hair follicle and its quality cannot be affected by external  applications; even then products in the market promise to improve hair growth  and retard greying.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the entry of international brands in the Indian market, useless health  drinks, herbal tea, nutritional supplements and breakfast cereals lure  customers with the false promise of improving health. Buyers are lured by the  nutritional and calorie content charts presented in stylish print and catchy  formats. These products contain iron, calcium, minerals, trace elements or  vitamins, but only in sub-therapeutic quantities. Such nutrients are present in  larger quantities in the normal Indian diet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, the FDA in Mumbai raided a 'herbal' tea distributor. An analysis  found the 'herbal tea' to be ordinary tea sold in fancy packaging for a high  price. Because there are takers, there are sellers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, certain newspapers and magazines carried colourful advertisements for  'bust oil'. Among the claims made about the oil is that 'it keeps the breast  toned up, it is needed by almost all age groups, it gives firmer, younger and  tighter breasts,' and so on. Efforts must be made to counter such false and  unethical advertisements.
