  <p>I write  this article with overwhelming sadness. The reason I am writing this is because  my wife and friends felt that I must at least explain my reasons for going back  to the UK, in case it helps someone. I am, however, so cynical about the system  that I doubt it will make a difference.</p>

  <h4>Why  I returned to India</h4>
  <p>
  I completed my MD in General Medicine in 1987 from Pune and went to the UK in  1988 as I was sure that I did not want to become a superspecialist (despite the  objections of my mentor and dear friend). I felt that at 26 years I was too  young to settle down in practice.</p>
  <p>I had  always dreamed of going to England, and with the encouragement of my father (a  professor of pharma-cology), I did my PLAB and spent four years in the UK on  limited registration.</p>
  <p>We were  12 batchmates from undergraduate days in the UK and initially we would meet  regularly and debate the future with the enthusiasm of the young. Most felt  that the government was to be blamed; the situation was bleak; going back would  be difficult. Mine would be the lone voice that urged my friends to return and  do their bit for their country. Perhaps we would not be able to change the  system but we would have a good bash at it! Of the 12, only I returned one week  before my permitted four years were up. I remember telling a friend, who is now  in the US, that he did not have any love for his land of birth like I had; he  returned from England for his parents (he was the only son of his parents). But  isn't love for one's country something to be proud of? I remember as a boy  reading with great admiration stories of freedom fighters such as Bhagat Singh  and Khudiram Bose willingly going to the gallows&mdash;of how love for one's country  transcends any other love. And that is why I returned to India in 1992&mdash;not only  for my parents whose only son I am, but for my country that I loved and still  love!</p>
  <p>I  willingly gave up dreams of settling in the UK and achieving a consultant grade  in the NHS. After all, career and job satisfaction were not all that mattered.  Country, parents, friends, all mattered to an equal degree.<br />
  So what happened? I had always known that practice was not going to be easy but  I quickly realised that it was more difficult than I had ever imagined. For  some time, I debated joining an NGO and working in a rural area. I did not  manage that, but married Samata who worked for a rural NGO and continues to do  so.</p>

  <h4>Disappointment</h4>
  <p>
    On my return, I joined the newly begun intensive care unit (ICU) in a new  private hospital attached to a medical college so that I could have a fixed  salary at the end of the month. The experience was an eye opener-although the  hospital hardly had any patients, the management still wanted the patients to  pay for their treatment. As the hospital was not offering state-of-the-art treatment,  the beds in the hospital and ICU remained sorrowfully empty.</p>
  <p>Nine  months later, I moved to a big private hospital run by a charitable trust to  work in the ICU. I had hoped that after four years in the UK and an MRCP, I  would at least be appointed as a consultant but I was appointed as a registrar  with the princely pay of Rs 4500. (In retrospect, it is humiliating, especially  when I compare my 10-plus years of learning with whizz-kids earning an MBA and  then landing a job of Rs 2-3 lakh per month.) Part of the reason for not being  called a consultant but only a registrar was that intensive care was not  well-established in India at that time, and as a consultant intensivist I could  question other physicians and surgeons. As a registrar I could only follow  orders and be the man on the spot to take care of any emergencies that may  arise. I found that drug prescribing was by and large irrational and never  based on any protocol. I suspect that in a private hospital, following a  protocol is tantamount to saying that someone else is better or has more  expertise in a certain specialty-just not the done thing in India. I have since  returned to the UK where I am working as a consultant physician and find that  the standard protocol to treat community-acquired pneumonia is ampicillin (plus  a macrolide). This would be unthinkable in any private Indian hospital.</p>

  <h4>Other  problems</h4>
  <p>
    Second opinions were taboo and uncommon, much to the detriment of the patients.  Audits were frowned upon, as no consultant liked to be pulled up for any  mistake, genuine or otherwise. This of course meant that patient care did not  improve and a good opportunity to learn and continuously educate oneself was  lost. I must put on record that I tried to set up protocols and audit systems  and had various discussions with my senior colleagues over the years. The  response was, not surprisingly, disappointing.</p>
  <p>To be  honest, I was happy with the clinical part of my job&mdash;though private practice  was not 'lucrative'&mdash;especially as I was not willing to succumb to the usual  short cuts to 'successful' practice. I remember interrupting a conversation  between two doctors-one saying that if he was referred a patient by another  doctor, it was expected that he referred him back another patient. I  interrupted to ask what the difference was between such practice and giving  overt 'cuts' (paybacks). I also mentioned that I had managed to survive without  resorting to such pernicious practices. Both looked at me and nicely  pigeon-holed me by saying, 'But you are different.' It was almost an  accusation.</p>
  <p>I tried  to bring in good clinical practices&mdash;medical audits, protocols, rational  antibiotic prescriptions&mdash;but with no great support. We did manage to set up an  Infection Control Society but always felt that we skirted major issues and  ended up tackling inconsequential minor problems such as where to station water  sinks and what soap to order. I ended up spending up to 25% of my time battling  with the management on administrative issues, and 25% with colleagues trying to  tell them what the best treatment plan should be.</p>
  <p>I found  that senior doctors in the ICU and CCU earned a 'cut' on every patient in the  Unit&mdash;it made me wonder whether doctors could remain ethical with such financial  temptations. Often, the doctors had insisted on such modes of payment.</p>
  <p>I joined  the Health Committee of the Lok Vignyan Sanghatana&mdash;a group of doctors who want  to do rational, ethical practice and provide health education towards that end.  Many doctors debated rationally on available evidence about the management of  various illnesses. This was heartening. In actual practice, however, not a few  of these very same doctors were irrational and even unethical!</p>
  <p>I lost  faith in superspecialists, many of whom make money on the side for referring  patients for surgery. I also had a problem when I wanted a genuine second  opinion&mdash;experience taught me that I could keep little faith and respect for  most fellow practitioners.</p>
  <p>I  resigned from this hospital and joined another leading hospital. My colleague  who headed the ICU invited me to join as a senior member of the team and, after  some misgivings, I joined. However, I found it uncomfortable to work there with  and under a close friend and on at least some occasions found my decisions  overruled without discussion. Although the hospital had state-of-the-art  equipment, care was not taken to discuss the cost of treatment and likely  outcome with the patients and their relatives. This practice left many almost  bankrupt by the time their treatment ended.</p>
  <p>This  was far from the humane and compassionate medicine that I had believed I could  and wished to practise. For all these reasons I decided to return to the UK. I  am going with a heavy heart (despite the advice in the Bhagavad Gita to do  one's duty without expecting reward) and with a sense of defeat.</p>
  <p>In the  UK, a significantly higher degree of scientific, moral and ethical principles  are followed. I hope I can practise in a similar manner at some stage in India.  Perhaps this is being overoptimistic.</p>
