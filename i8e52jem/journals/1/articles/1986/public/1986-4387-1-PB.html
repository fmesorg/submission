				<h4>'Foeticide' is problematic  terminology</h4>
				<p>
					This has reference to the article 'Female foeticide: Where do we  go?' by Mohan Rao <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao Mohan. 'Female foeticide: where do we go?' Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 123-124." id="1">(1)</a>.

					Dr Rao has drawn much needed attention to the controversial issue  of 'choice' and the 'right' of the woman to access technology for pre-natal  sex-determination and subsequent abortion of the female foetus. Women's groups  campaigning against sex-determination have been, for the past decade and a  half, in the peculiar position of spearheading a campaign in which the  'masses', including women, are seemingly against us. In fact, unlike in  movements against other forms of violence against women, such as rape, domestic  violence and dowry harassment, this campaign has the unique distinction of  having no discernible victim. For, we are led to believe, scientists want to  develop this technology, medical practitioners want to implement it, and women  want to use it. So, where is the problem, and who is being harmed? Here we come  to the uncomfortable question. Is our 'victim' the female foetus? Does a foetus  have rights? And this is where the terminology currently in vogue, and also  used by Mohan Rao in his article, is problematic. Female 'foeticide',  undoubtedly a catchy phrase, implies the murder of the female foetus and imbues  the foetus with a life, a soul, and rights, including the right to life.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the past decade and a half, the campaign against sex  determination and selective abortion has had to tread a very thin line, and  negotiate grey areas in issues of women's 'reproductive rights'. We have  attempted to highlight the fact that pre-natal sex-determination and  sex-selective abortion is a grave form of violence against women. Ironically, our  campaign has also drawn support from right-wing fundamentalists of all  religions. 'Right-to-lifers', who deny women the basic right to control their  fertility and the right to abortion, have also used the arguments put forward  by women's groups and condemned 'female foeticide'. 'Caravan', a campaign in  Delhi initiated in October 2001 by several community-based organisations,  women's groups and the Delhi Commission for Women, has posters and publicity  material carrying the picture of a foetus in a womb, with messages like  "Kokh mein beti ki hatya roko" (Stop the murder of daughters in the  womb), <em>"Mujhe jeene  do"</em> (Let me live), <em>"Meri hatya  mat karo"</em> (Don't murder me), etc. While these slogans are no doubt extremely  emotive, they are dangerously close to a right-wing line against abortion  itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					That this anti-abortion line was pushed at the IMA-NCW-UNICEF  meeting of religious heads mentioned by Dr Rao is hardly surprising. The masses  were exhorted not to 'indulge' in sex-determination and aborting female foetuses  because every female is a potential mother, and therefore a 'devi'. Women's  rights in and of themselves were hardly on the agenda, as could be expected in  this forum. It is no wonder that many women's groups are viewing with suspicion  these unholy alliances between religious heads, medical professionals and  bodies like the National Commission for Women. As Mohan Rao rightly says, we  cannot sup with the Devil. However hungry we may be.
				</p>
				<p>
					The growth of sex-pre-selection techniques further complicates the  issue, since the question is no longer one of abortion. Here, we have a crime  with an even more invisible victim.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need to articulate a nuanced understanding of women's rights,  so that seeming contradictions do not make our stands untenable.
