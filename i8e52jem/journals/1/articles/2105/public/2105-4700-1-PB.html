				<h4>Introduction: three schemes of organ donation</h4>
				<p>
					Singapore was the first Commonwealth country to enact, in 1987, a presumed consent law for organ donation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prabhakar KS. Cadaveric and living organ donation. Natural limitations. Possible solutions. Singapore experience. Ann Transplant. 2004;9(1):31-3." id="1">(1)</a>. Referred to as the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), it applied only to persons between the ages of 21 and 60 years who had suffered accidental deaths certified by the criteria of brain death or cardiac death; who were non-Muslims; and who had not formally dissented from ("opted out of") organ donation. The actual policy was implemented in 1988, after a six-month period to allow objectors to register their dissent, and applied only to donation of kidneys. The new law at that time came into existence alongside the older Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act (MTERA) of 1972, an "opt-in" scheme of voluntary donation, where persons could pledge to donate their organs and tissues (eg kidney, liver, heart, cornea, lung, bone, skin, heart valves, etc) for the purposes of transplantation, education or research upon death. An amendment to the HOTA in 2004 also permitted living organ donation, and permitted retrieval of other types of organs besides kidneys (livers, hearts, and corneas). The 2004 amendment further included all causes of death rather than solely death by accidental causes. Hence, in effect, three schemes of organ donation were set in place in Singapore by 2004, and further legislative amendments (2007, 2009 to HOTA) were made with the firm intent of expanding the supply of transplantable organs, and ensuring that organ donors are not exploited, unlawfully induced, or forced into organ retrieval by others (<em>see</em> Table 1).

				<h4>The current situation</h4>
				<p>
					Organ donation rates under Singapore's older opt-in law (the MTERA, enacted in 1972) have been poor despite door-to-door canvassing and media publicity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and continuing transplant awareness education through information booklets posted to citizens and permanent residents six months before the age of 21. Even after 35 years of canvassing donors for pledges, only 1.3% of citizens and permanent residents pledged their organs in 2007 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kwek TK, Lew TW, Tan HL, Kong S. The transplantable organ shortage in Singapore: has implementation of presumed consent to organ donation made a difference? Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2009 Apr;38(4):346-8." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					These low take-up rates had prompted the introduction of the presumed consent/opt-out system under the HOTA in 1987. Opt-outs are rare, and this observation is consistent with research conducted regarding defaults and organ donations. Results of the survey revealed donation rates to be double in an opt-out system as opposed to an opt-in system <a href="#four" title="Johnson EJ, Goldstein D. Medicine. Do defaults save lives? Science. 2003 Nov 21;302(5649):1338-9." class="reference" id="4" rel="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover">(4)</a>. Between 2004 and 2009, only 2%&ndash;3% of Singaporeans opted out of donating organs after death <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kwek TK, Lew TW, Tan HL, Kong S. The transplantable organ shortage in Singapore: has implementation of presumed consent to organ donation made a difference? Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2009 Apr;38(4):346-8." id="3">(3)</a>. Hence, the presumed consent law had effectively increased the donor pool by more than 95% of the Singapore population. Yet, donor actualisation rates continue to fall. The introduction of the HOTA increased the rate of deceased donor kidney transplants from 4.7 per year during 1970&ndash;1988 to 41.4 per year during 1988&ndash;2004 <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vathsala A. Twenty-five facts about kidney disease in Singapore: in remembrance of World Kidney Day. Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2007 Mar;36(3):157-60." id="5">(5)</a>. But early expectations of increased organ retrieval over time through the presumed consent to donation scheme enacted in the HOTA have not materialised <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vathsala A.

					With the initial enthusiasm about the presumed consent system, some members of the transplant community claimed that, while Singapore's religious and cultural pluralism might present many obstacles to deceased organ donation, social changes were afoot that would render obsolete, or at least ameliorate the effects of, belief systems that opposed the retrieval of bodily organs after death <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Woo KT. Social and cultural aspects of organ donation in Asia. Ann Acad Med Singapore. 1992 May;21(3):421-7." id="10">(10)</a>. However, while social change may be the reason that recent findings regarding the positive attitudes towards living organ donation of Singaporeans who are younger, more educated, have higher incomes, are single (never married, divorced or widowed), and hold professional jobs <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Owyong LM, Lim C, Leng CW, van der Erf S, Joshi VD, Sin ST, Hong ST, Chye PG, Seng GT, Yi-Shern TK.

					The history of organ transplantation in Singapore and the procurement of organs for transplantation are ethically sensitive issues. This review has focused on low organ procurement rates in Singapore over the years, and on the analysis of reasons that has become available in the literature on this subject. Writers have been equally prolific in recommending strategies for improving the organ donation record in Singapore, and expressing perspectives on the ethics of different approaches <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Prabhakar KS.

					While the enactment of a presumed consent law in 1987 was momentous and led many in the transplant community to think that progress in transplantation was inevitable, the reality as we now know has been less encouraging. The present consensus appears to be that legislation alone is not enough to raise organ donation to higher levels to meet the needs of patients with end-stage organ failure, a problem that has reached unprecedented levels in Singapore. Transplant professionals have pressed for better practical strategies to address the areas of personal motivation of donors, eg the willingness of younger Singaporeans to make living donations to intimates but not strangers, and the willingness of the elderly to donate to strangers <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Owyong LM, Lim C, Leng CW, van der Erf S, Joshi VD, Sin ST, Hong ST, Chye PG, Seng GT, Yi-Shern TK. Factors influencing living kidney donation in Singapore.

The transplantable organ shortage in Singapore: has implementation of presumed consent to organ donation made a difference?

					After presumed consent, the next era of transplant services in Singapore is likely to focus on ethically informed transplant practices that emphasise motivational factors in voluntary deceased and living organ donation; strengthening understanding of the present communitarian basis of the organ donation system under the HOTA; professional training, independence and integrity in the clinical and administrative setting in light of ethical objections to the "dead donor rule", and the application of difficult-to-accept neurological criteria for the determination of death; judicious extension of donor criteria (donation after cardiac death, deceased donors with clinical risk factors) without compromising fair outcomes for all recipients.
