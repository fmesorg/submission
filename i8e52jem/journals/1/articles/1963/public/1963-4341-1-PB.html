				<h4>Ethics in India</h4>
				<p>
					There is so much of 'ethics' in the air, even among our political (frightened) class that there is a distinct fear of the rhetoric becoming hypocritical, imitative and demonstratively vulgar. We shall again elevate ambivalence into a mystique and refuse to see truths steadily.
				</p>
				<p>
					I saw this dance of rhetoric divorced from meaning during an extended tour of Tamil Nadu, with many tall poppies mowed down and yet not seen as guilty by a significant minority! Most of them have bought the argument that for a politician a term in jail is almost the same as losing an election!! -meaning it will pass (- and soon).
