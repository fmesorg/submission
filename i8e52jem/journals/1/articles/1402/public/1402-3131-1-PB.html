			<!-- Horizontal Line -->
			<hr />
			<div class="intro">
				<p>
					The eHealth Code of  Ethics was developed by a summit in early 2000, with participants representing  all sectors of the eHealth community, including members of the Internet  Healthcare Coalition, Hi-Ethics, HON, and the AMA, as well as consumers and  patients. A second eHealth Ethics Initiative Summit meeting is planned to be  held in Geneva before the spring of 2001 to define an implementation plan  acceptable to stakeholders. This meeting will be open to all interested  parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the eHealth Code of Ethics is to ensure that people worldwide can  confidently and with full understanding of known risks realise the potential of  the Internet in managing their own health and the health of those in their  care.
				</p>

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					The Internet is changing how people give and receive health information  and health care. All people who use the Internet for health-related purposes &mdash; patients, health care professionals and administrators, researchers, those who  create or sell health products or services, and other stakeholders &mdash; must join  together to create a safe environment and enhance the value of the Internet for  meeting health care needs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because health information, products, and services have the potential both to  improve health and to do harm, organisations and individuals that provide  health information on the Internet have obligations to be trustworthy, provide  high quality content, protect users' privacy, and adhere to standards of best  practices for on-line commerce and on-line professional services in health  care.
				</p>

				<p>
					People who use Internet health sites and services share a responsibility to  help assure the value and integrity of the health Internet by exercising  judgment in using sites, products, and services, and by providing meaningful  feedback about on-line health information, products, and services.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Definitions</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Health information</em> includes information for staying well, preventing  and managing disease, and making other decisions related to health and health  care. It includes information for making decisions about health products and  health services. It may be in the form of data, text, audio, and/or video. It  may involve enhancements through programming and interactivity.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Health products</em> include drugs, medical devices, and other goods used to  diagnose and treat illnesses or injuries or to maintain health. Health products  include both drugs and medical devices subject to regulatory approval by  agencies such as the U. S. Food and Drug Administration or U. K. Medicines  Control Agency and vitamin, herbal, or other nutritional supplements and other  products not subject to such regulatory oversight.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Health services</em> include specific, personal medical care or advice; management  of medical records; communication between health care providers and/or  patients and health plans or insurers, or health care facilities regarding  treatment decisions, claims, billing for services, etc.; and other services  provided to support health care. Health services also include list serves,  bulletin boards, chat rooms, and other on-line venues for the exchange of  health information. Like health information, health services may be in the form  of data, text, audio, and/or video, and may involve enhancements through  programming and interactivity.
				</p>

				<p>
					Anyone who uses the Internet for health-related reasons has a right to expect  that organisations and individuals who provide health information, products or  services online will uphold the following guiding principles:
				</p>
				<h5>Candor</h5>
				<p>
					People who use the Internet for health-related purposes need to be able  to judge for themselves that the sites they visit and services they use are  credible and trustworthy. Sites should clearly indicate
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						who owns or has a significant       financial interest in the site or service
					</li>
					<li>
						what the purpose of the site or       service is. <em>For example,</em> whether it is solely educational, sells health       products or&nbsp; services, or offers personal medical care or advice
					</li>
					<li>
						any relationship (financial,       professional, personal, or other) that a reasonable person would believe       would likely influence his or her perception of the information, products,       or services offered by the site <em>For example,</em> if the site has commercial       sponsors or partners, who those sponsors/partners are and whether they       provide content for the site
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Honesty</h5>
				<p>
					People who seek health  information on the Internet need to know that products or services are  described truthfully and that information they receive is not presented in a  misleading way.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sites should be forthright:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						in all content used to promote       the sale of health products or services&nbsp;
					</li>
					<li>
						in any claims about the       efficacy, performance, or benefits of products or services
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					They should clearly  distinguish content intended to promote or sell a product, service, or  organisation from educational or scientific content.
				</p>

				<h5>Quality</h5>
				<p>
					To make wise decisions about their health care, people need and have  the right to expect that sites will provide accurate, well-supported  information and products and services of high quality.
				</p>

				<p>
					To assure that the health information they provide is accurate, eHealth sites  and services should make good faith efforts to
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						evaluate information rigorously       and fairly, including information used to describe products or services
					</li>
					<li>
						provide information that is       consistent with the best available evidence
					</li>
					<li>
						assure that when personalized       medical care or advice is provided that care or advice is given by a       qualified practitioner
					</li>
					<li>
						indicate clearly whether       information is based on scientific studies, expert consensus, or       professional or personal experience or opinion
					</li>
					<li>
						acknowledge that some issues       are controversial and when that is the case make good faith efforts to       present all reasonable sides in a fair and balanced way
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<em>For example,</em> advise  users that there are alternative treatments for a particular health condition,  such as surgery or radiation for prostate cancer
				</p>

				<p>
					Information and services must be easy for consumers to understand and use.  Sites should present information and describe products or services
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						in language that is clear, easy       to read, and appropriate for intended users . <em>For example,</em> in culturally       appropriate ways in the primary language (or languages) of the site's       expected audience and
					</li>
					<li>
						in a way that accommodates       special needs users may have . <em>For example,</em> in large type or through audio       channels for users whose vision is impaired
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Sites that provide  information primarily for educational or scientific purposes should guarantee the  independence of their editorial policy and practices by assuring that only the  site's content editors determine editorial content and have the authority to  reject advertising that they believe is inappropriate.
				</p>

				<p>
					Consumers have a right to expect that the information they receive is up to  date. Sites should clearly indicate
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						when the site published the       information it provides (and what version of the information users are       seeing if it has been revised since it was first published)
					</li>
					<li>
						when the site most recently       reviewed the information
					</li>
					<li>
						whether the site has made       substantive changes in the information and if so, when the information was       most recently updated (Provide the information users need to make their       own judgments about the health information, products, or services provided       by the site)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Individuals need to be  able to judge for themselves the quality of the health information they find on  the Internet. Sites should describe clearly and accurately how content is  developed for the site by telling users
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						what sources the site or       content provider has used, with references or links to those sources
					</li>
					<li>
						how the site evaluates content       and what criteria are used to evaluate content, including on what basis       the site decides to provide specific links to other sites or services . <em>For example,</em> by describing the site's editorial board and policies
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					When health products or  services are subject to government regulation, sites should tell users whether  those products (such as drugs or medical devices) have been approved by appropriate  regulatory agencies, such as the U. S. Food and Drug Administration or U. K.  Medicines Control Agency
				</p>
				<h5>Informed consent</h5>
				<p>
					People who use the Internet for health related reasons have the right  to be informed that personal data may be gathered, and to choose whether they  will allow their personal data to be whether or how their personal data may be  collected, used, and whether they will allow it to be used or shared. And they  have a right to be able to choose, consent, and control when and how they actively  engage in a commercial relationship.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sites should clearly disclose
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						that there are potential risks       to users' privacy on the Internet . <em>For example,</em> that other organisations       or individuals may be able to collect personal data when someone visits a       site, without that site's knowledge; or that some jurisdictions (such as       the European Union) protect privacy more stringently than others . Sites       should not collect, use, or share personal data without the user's       specific affirmative consent. To assure that users understand and make       informed decisions about providing personal data, sites should indicate       clearly and accurately
					</li>
					<li>
						what data is being collected       when users visit the site . <em>For example,</em> data about which parts of the       site the user visited, or the user's name and email address, or specific       data about the user's health or on-line purchases
					</li>
					<li>
						who is collecting that data . <em>For example,</em> the site itself, or a third party
					</li>
					<li>
						how the site will use that data       . <em>For example,</em> to help the site provide better services to users, as part       of a scientific study, or to provide personalised medical care or advice
					</li>
					<li>
						whether the site knowingly       shares data with other organisations or individuals and if so, what data       it shares
					</li>
					<li>
						which organisations or       individuals the site shares data with and
					</li>
					<li>
						how it expects its affiliates       to use that data . <em>For example,</em> whether the site will share users'       personal data with other organisations or individuals and for what       purposes, and note when personal data will be shared with organizations or       individuals in other countries
					</li>
					<li>
						obtain users affirmative       consent to collect, use, or share personal data in the ways described . <em>For example,</em> to collect and use the visitor's personal data in scientific       research, or for commercial reasons such as sending information about new       products or services to the user, or to share his or her personal data       with other organisations or individuals
					</li>
					<li>
						what consequences there may be       when a visitor refuses to give personal data . <em>For example,</em> that the site       may not be able to tailor the information it provides to the visitor's       particular needs, or that the visitor may not have access to all areas of       the site "Ecommerce" sites have an obligation to make clear to users when       they are about to engage in a commercial transaction and to obtain users'       specific affirmative consent to participate in that commercial transaction.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Privacy</h5>
				<p>
					People who use the  Internet for health related reasons have the right to expect that personal data  they provide will be kept confidential. Personal health data in particular may  be very sensitive, and the consequences of inappropriate disclosure can be  grave. To protect users, sites that collect personal data should take  reasonable steps to prevent unauthorised access to or use of personal data . <em>For example,</em> by "encrypting" data, protecting files with passwords, or using  appropriate security software for all transactions involving users' personal  medical or financial data
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						make it easy for users to       review personal data they have given and to update it or correct it when       appropriate
					</li>
					<li>
						adopt reasonable mechanisms to       trace how personal data is used . <em>For example,</em> by using "audit trails"       that show who viewed the data and when
					</li>
					<li>
						tell how the site stores users'       personal data and for how long it stores that data
					</li>
					<li>
						assure that when personal data       is "de-identified" (that is, when the user's name, email address, or other       data that might identify him or her has been removed from the file) it       cannot be linked back to the user
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Professionalism in  on-line health care</h4>
				<p>
					Physicians, nurses,  pharmacists, therapists, and all other health care professionals who provide specific,  personal medical care or advice on-line should
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						abide by the ethical codes that       govern their professions as clients and practitioners in face-to-face       relationships do no harm,
					</li>
					<li>
						put patients' and clients'       interests first
					</li>
					<li>
						protect patients' confidentiality
					</li>
					<li>
						clearly disclose any       sponsorships, financial incentives, or other information that would likely       affect the patient's or client's perception of professional's role or the       services offered
					</li>
					<li>
						clearly disclose what fees, if       any, will be charged for the on-line consultation and how payment for       services is to be made
					</li>
					<li>
						obey the laws and regulations       of relevant jurisdiction(s), including applicable laws governing       professional licensing and prescribing
					</li>
					<li>
						Inform and educate patients and       clients about the limitations of on-line health care.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The Internet can be a  powerful tool for helping to meet patients' health care needs, but users need  to understand that it also has limitations. Health care professionals who  practice on the Internet should clearly and accurately
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						identify themselves and tell       patients or clients where they practice and what their professional       credentials are
					</li>
					<li>
						describe the terms and       conditions of the particular on-line interaction . <em>For example,</em> whether       the health care professional will provide general advice about a       particular health condition or will make specific recommendations and or       referrals for the patient or client, or whether the health care       professional can and will or cannot and will not prescribe medications in       the particular situation
					</li>
					<li>
						make good faith efforts to       understand the patient's or client's particular circumstances and to help       him or her identify health care resources that are available locally . For       example, to help the patient or client determine whether particular       treatment is available in his or her home community or only from providers       outside his or her community
					</li>
					<li>
						give clear instructions for       follow up care when appropriate or necessary
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Health care professionals who offer personal medical services or advice on-line  should
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						clearly and accurately describe       the constraints of on-line diagnosis and treatment recommendations . For       example, providers should stress that because the on-line health care       professional cannot examine the patient, it is important for patients to       describe their health care needs as clearly they can
					</li>
					<li>
						help "e-patients" understand       when on-line consultation can and when it cannot and should not take the       place of a face-to-face interaction with a health care provider
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Responsible Partnering</h5>
				<p>
					People need to be  confident that organisations and individuals who operate on the Internet  undertake to partner only with trustworthy individuals or organisations.  Whether they are for-profit or nonprofit, sites should
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						make reasonable efforts to       ensure that sponsors, partners, or other affiliates abide by applicable       law and uphold the same ethical standards as the sites themselves
					</li>
					<li>
						insist that current or       prospective sponsors not influence the way search results are displayed       for specific information on key words or topics and they should indicate       clearly to users
					</li>
					<li>
						whether links to other sites       are provided for information only or are endorsements of those other sites       when they are leaving the site . <em>For example,</em> by use of transition screens
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Accountability</h5>
				<p>
					People need to be confident that organisations and individuals that  provide health information, products, or services on the Internet take users'  concerns seriously and that sites make good faith efforts to ensure that their practices  are ethically sound. eHealth sites should
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						indicate clearly to users how       they can contact the owner of the site or service and/or the party       responsible for managing the site or service . <em>For example,</em> how to contact       specific manager(s) or customer service representatives with authority to       address problems) and monitor their compliance with the <strong><em>eHealth Code of       Ethics.</em></strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						provide easy-to-use tools for       visitors to give feedback about the site and the quality of its       information, products, or services
					</li>
					<li>
						review complaints from users       promptly and respond in a timely and appropriate manner. Sites should       encourage users to notify the site's manager(s) or customer service       representatives if they believe that a site's commercial or noncommercial       partners or affiliates, including sites to which links are provided, may       violate law or ethical principles. eHealth sites should  describe their policies for self monitoring clearly for users, and should  encourage creative problem solving among site staff and affiliates.
					</li>
