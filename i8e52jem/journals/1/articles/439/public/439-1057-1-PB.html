			<h3>The draft ART (Regulation) Bill: in whose interest?</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Sarojini N B, Aastha Sharma</h4>

				<p>
					The process of regulating conceptive technologies (like
					artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation and surrogacy)
					commonly known as Assisted Reproductive Technologies
					(ARTs), which started in 1999 in the country, reached an
					important turning point on September 13, 2008. At a two day
					National Consultation on 'Assisted Reproductive Technologies
					(ARTs): Emerging Concerns and Future Strategies' organised
					by Sama Resource Group for Women and Health in New Delhi,
					the Indian Council of Medical Research presented the Draft
					Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulation) Bill &amp; Rules-
					2008. The Bill has been in the pipeline for about three years
					now and has finally been made public on the websites of the
					Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian Council of
					Medical Research <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, Indian Council of Medical Research. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill & Rules - 2008. [Draft]. New Delhi: MOH&FW, ICMR; 2008, [cited 2008 Dec 30]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/art/Draft%20ART%20(Regulation)%20Bill%20&%20Rules%20-%202008-1.PDF" id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women and health rights activists have been looking forward
					to the drafting of this Bill in light of the unregulated practice
					of these technologies and the increasing commercialisation
					and commodification of women's reproductive tissues. The
					Bill is based on the 'National Guidelines for Accreditation,
					Supervision and Regulation of ART Clinics in India' issued by
					the ICMR in 2005. It is a welcome and much appreciated step,
					but unfortunately, it carries on the vestiges of the drawbacks
					present in the guidelines. Although some of the concerns
					regarding the guidelines have been taken into account, many
					issues-some new, some old-continue to be contentious.
				</p>
				<p>
					Concerned activists feel that the Draft Bill tends to regularise
					and promote the interest of the providers of these technologies
					rather than regulate and monitor the current practices. The Bill
					is also inadequate in protecting and safeguarding the rights
					and health of the women who undergo these procedures,
					surrogates and egg donors and of the children born through
					these techniques. The Bill also actively promotes medical
					tourism in India for reproductive purposes. Though the Bill
					takes some step to regulate the process of surrogacy in the
					context of growing numbers of foreign couples coming
					to India, the equally important issue of Indian women also
					becoming egg 'donors' for foreign couples is not taken into
					consideration.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bill, making commercial surrogacy legal, prohibits the use
					of the egg of the surrogate mother for attaining pregnancy.
					This implies that an infertile couple will have to look for a
					surrogate as well as an egg donor; further, a woman with a
					healthy reproductive system (surrogate) will be subjected to
					a complicated, hazardous and expensive procedure like in
					vitro fertilisation rather than a simpler one like intra uterine  insemination (IUI). The legislation is self-contradictory when
					it comes to protecting the anonymity of the surrogate. The
					document, while insisting on a number of measures to be
					taken to ensure the anonymity of the surrogate, states that the
					surrogate mother should register under her own name for the
					purpose of medical treatment and provide the name of the
					couple for whom she is acting as surrogate. If the legislation
					makes it mandatory for the surrogate to disclose her identity,
					then it is unclear as to how her privacy and anonymity will be
					maintained.
				</p>
				<p>
					In case the intended couples are NRIs or foreigners, the
					legislation makes provision for them to appoint a guardian to
					be legally responsible for taking care of the surrogate during
					the gestation period till the child is delivered to the foreigner or
					foreigner couple. But, there is no clarity on who can be the local
					guardian and the guardian's exact responsibility. Also, the role
					of the local guardian in case of any mishap to the surrogate or
					the child does not find a mention in the legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal parentage of children born through surrogacy has
					not been adequately tackled and situations where the intended
					couple no longer want the child, split up, pass away or abandon
					the child have not been addressed. The process of handing over
					the child from the surrogate to the intended parents has also
					not been adequately addressed. The legislation also clarifies
					that the name on the birth certificate will be that of the genetic
					parents, thus equating the term with intended parents/parent.
					Such a clause, although protecting the anonymity of the donor,
					presumes that the intended parents will also be the genetic
					parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bill states that a woman may act as a surrogate for three
					successful births in her lifetime, including a maximum of three
					attempts at pregnancy for a particular couple. This takes the
					number of times she can undergo IVF cycles to a high figure,
					thus jeopardising her physical and mental health. Along
					similar lines, the Bill permits a woman to donate her eggs six
					times in her life, at intervals of three months, which again
					could be hazardous for her health. But an important aspect
					of the maximum number of eggs that can be retrieved in
					each IVF cycle is still left untouched in the legislation, thereby
					completely leaving it in the hands of the providers to decide
					on this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surprisingly, semen banks have been made quite an important
					player in the ART industry and are supposed to provide not
					only donor semen but also donor oocytes and surrogates. Egg
					or oocyte retrieval from a donor, unlike semen collection, is acomplicated process and calls for sophisticated equipment as
					well as expertise. The process of equipping semen banks for
					these procedures is not clear. Moreover, semen banks have
					been permitted to advertise and make payments to donors
					and then source them to the ART clinics. The legislation is silent
					on the regulation of the semen banks in spite of giving them
					important roles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The document is still ambiguous on certain key areas like
					the maximum age of women who can opt for ARTs (while
					mentioning the minimum age to be 21 years), the eligibility of
					persons from different sexual orientations for accessing these
					technologies, and listing the disorders/diseases that a gamete
					donor and surrogate need to be screened for. Certain other
					clauses also call for an explanation of the rationale behind
					them, like prohibiting the use of sperm or eggs from a relative
					or a known person, prohibition of genetic surrogacy, and the
					role envisaged for the semen banks. The Bill is weak on the
					operational realities of the processes it aims to put in place and
					contradicts itself at several places.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the drafting of the Bill should be looked at as a
					positive step towards regulation of this burgeoning industry.
					But the ICMR must not rush into finalising the Bill till a wider
					debate across the country, at various levels and regions, has
					been conducted and their responses incorporated. The Bill
					should be kept open for public critique for at least a period of
					six months, during which all concerned groups can adequately
					articulate their suggestions.
