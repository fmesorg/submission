				<h4>The Forum for Medical Ethics Society</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Background</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics is integral to the legitimacy of modern healthcare. It helps protect patients' rights, facilitates the conduct of transparent and humane research, and enables medical practitioners to deliver rational, patient-friendly and compassionate care. And yet it continues to be largely absent from the healthcare discourse in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Inception</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES) was founded by a group of Mumbai-based medical practitioners in 1989. The primary agenda of this group was to highlight issues in medical ethics and generate discussions around them. FMES was registered as a Trust and Society in 1995.
				</p>
				<p>
					FMES contested the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) elections in 1992 with a panel of eight doctors under the name 'Forum for Medical Ethics'. The objective was to orient the MMC to strengthen the ethical voice of medical practitioners. Though the panel won a substantial number of votes and support from several members of the medical fraternity, it lost the elections. But this attempt was successful in bringing to light the corruption in the Medical Council election system. The same corrupt practices were documented by the Observers appointed by the Mumbai High Court during the 1997 MMC elections.
				</p>
				<p>
					After more than a decade of struggle, including litigation in the High Court of Bombay, FMES was able to make the state government institute some radical changes, and at present, the MMC is the only state medical council in India to have shifted to a secret ballot system of voting.

				<h4>The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Background</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME)</em> was founded by FMES in 1993. <em>IJME</em> has worked to highlight ethical principles in healthcare, draw attention to malpractices in the healthcare system, create awareness of the rights and responsibilities of patients and doctors, promote discussion with patients, and give importance to patients' perspectives.
					The journal has generated exchanges between non-medical experts, philosophers and social scientists, medical providers, health researchers, paramedical personnel and advocacy groups. <em>IJME</em> is, till date, the only journal on bioethics and medical ethics published from India.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Scope of the Journal</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>IJME</em> has successfully combined the scope and potential of academics, advocacy, knowledge dissemination and public debates. It is a repository of case studies, commentaries, original viewpoints and research findings. For over two decades now, it has served as a platform for deliberating on and discussing a wide range of issues on healthcare ethics in the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Indexing</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>IJME</em> is a peer-reviewed, quarterly journal indexed on MEDLINE, Google Scholar and The Philosopher's Index.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Access</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>IJME</em> is digitally available (<a href="http://ijme.in/index.php/ijme/" target="_blank">www.ijme.in</a>) and all back issues and current issue are free access. The 'Online First' section carries topical articles ahead of print.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>IJME</em> is associated with several ethics activities, and it organizes the National Bioethics Conference as a biennial event.

				<h4>The National Bio-ethics Conference</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Background</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary objective of organizing a conference on bioethics in India was to set up a platform for direct interaction between the stakeholders in bioethics. The National Bioethics Conferences (NBC) are organized in collaboration with medical science, social science, and non-governmental institutions. The first NBC was held at Mumbai in 2005; since then, the NBCs have been a biennial event, organized in 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2014. The sixth NBC is scheduled for early 2017 in Pune.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>The Conferences</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The NBCs are a meeting ground for delegates from India and abroad to report, debate and brainstorm on all kinds of ethical issues in health, healthcare, research and public health. Each NBC has witnessed the active participation of bioethicists from across the globe. A prime agenda of the conferences has been to contribute to bioethics in the context of a developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The themes of the first five NBCs were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ethical challenges in biomedical and social science research;
					</li>
					<li>
						Moral and ethical imperatives of healthcare technologies;
					</li>
					<li>
						Governance of healthcare: issues of ethics, equity and justice;
					</li>
					<li>
						Ethics and regulatory challenges in health research, and
					</li>
					<li>
						Integrity in medical care, public health and healthcare research.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The theme for the 6th NBC will be 'Healing and Dying with Dignity: Ethical Issues in Palliative Care, End of Life Care and Euthanesia'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 7th NBC and the 14th World Congress of Bioethics (WCB): The International Association of Bioethics (IAB) has awarded the organisation of the 14th WCB to the joint bid by FMES and Sama: Resource Group for Women and Health, New Delhi. The overarching theme of the conference is "Health for all in an unequal world: obligations of global bioethics". The WCB, a biennial activity, serves as a global platform in bioethics, and is organised by the IAB in collaboration with local key organising entities in different countries each time. In December 2018 the 7th NBC will be organised along with the 14th WCB, in New Delhi.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scientific sessions of the NBCs encourage research and reflection on bioethics. The papers and plenary presentations have been published in many journals, including <em>IJME</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result of the systematic efforts of FMES and the organizing role of <em>IJME</em> since 2005, today, the NBCs are an established platform for reporting, debating and discussing bioethics in this region.
				</p>
