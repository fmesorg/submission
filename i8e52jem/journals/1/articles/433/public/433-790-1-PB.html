<h3>Regulate technology, not lives: a critique of the draft ART (Regulation) Bill</h3>

					of ART clinics. It also purports to regulate surrogacy and
					respond to social and ethical issues around parenting
					associated with ARTs.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, a close inspection of the bill suggests that it is not
					meant to achieve such concerns. On the contrary, the intention
					seems to be to protect clinics from complaints in social
					disputes such as who the "real parent" of the child is. It does
					not protect women from dangerous technologies. It dwells on
					the infrastructure for clinics but underplays the side effects of
					the procedures. It specifies who may access the technologies
					but is unclear about whether these technologies are actually
					treatments for infertility. It also tries to safeguard the rights
					of the "commissioning couple" vis-&#224;-vis the surrogate while
					claiming to protect the rights of the surrogate.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this commentary on the ART Bill, I will discuss the principles
					behind ARTs to understand what should be regulated to
					protect the bodies of women who use these techniques.
					I will also raise some questions about the repeated use of
					technological solutions for social problems. Finally, I will
					propose that these technologies might actually be used to
					redefine certain norms in society.
					But to begin with, who do the assisted reproductive
					technologies really assist?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Who do ARTs assist?</h4>
				<p>
					Assisted reproductive technologies are essentially what the
					name suggests they are-technologies to assist reproduction.
					They are not treatments for infertility. Even in those rare cases
					when they are assisting the infertile, they do not cure them of
					infertility or treat them for it. In fact they make no such claims.
					Who can the ARTs assist in having children?
				</p>
				<p>
					They can assist those women who have husbands or male
					partners with no sperm, or low sperm count, or sperm that are
					not motile enough, or sperm that for some reason the women's
					bodies repulse. They can assist women who do not have fertile
					eggs being produced in their bodies, or those who cannot carry
					a full term pregnancy. They assist single women who do not
					have male partners to provide sperm and therefore need ARTs
					though they are fertile. They assist women who may or may
					not have husbands and have proven fertility but who decide to
					nurture a child for someone else in their own bodies (providing
					either the nurture alone or also the ovum or egg) either in an
					altruistic manner or in a commercial transaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					ARTs also assist men in a heterosexual relationship who have
					sperm-related problems. They assist single men who can use
					altruistic or commercial services from fertile women to beget
					children with their paternal lineage. They can also assist men
					who are in sexual relationships with other men to have their
					own genetic child from a woman without having sex with her
					though this option is rarely used.
				</p>
				<p>
					So ARTs can help people with many kinds of biological and
					social infertilities or inabilities to have their own geneticallyrelated
					children. Since they do not treat any biological causes
					of infertility, they are actually a technological solution to the
					social problem of not having a child of "one's own".
				</p>
				<p>
					It is true that not having a child of one's "own"-a child that
					bears a genetic imprint of oneself-is a social problem. It can
					make life for some people miserable and for many others very
					difficult. This is because genes are one of the ways in which
					families are made. Such families are assumed to be the essential
					material and emotional support for all people. They are also the
					only social security available to many people and therefore
					difficult to forego.
				</p>
				<p>
					A social problem needs a social solution. We need to have social
					security for all. We need to make a society that is more tolerant
					to all kinds of love, relationships and families. We need a society
					that respects diversity and difference. We need to explore the
					ways in which material and emotional support can be shared
					between a group of individuals irrespective of their ages and
					abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					ARTs, however, underline the importance of genetically linked
					families. In that sense, they provide individual solutions to a
					wider social problem. By feeding into the normative notions
					of family and support, they necessarily weaken all struggles to
					redefine the problem itself.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>What are the ARTs?</h4>
				<p>
					To add to this, many of these technologies (that are flaunted
					as major achievements of science) are harmful, especially forthe women whose bodies they invade. This fact is underplayed
					by the providers in the same way that the effect of harmful
					and invasive contraceptives is ignored. Once again individual
					women are forced to make a choice between the physiological
					suffering of ARTs and the social recriminations of not having
					a child of "one's own". However, we need to understand the
					principles of these technologies to comprehend the price that
					is paid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of technologies: one in
					which the fertilisation of the egg happens in vivo (inside the
					woman's body) and the other in which part or all of this process
					is done in vitro (in the laboratory).
				</p>
				<p>
					The first set of technologies involves manipulation of the
					husband's sperm (from the woman's husband or partner or
					from other men). These sperm are then introduced into the
					woman's uterus or vagina through a syringe (instead of the
					normal procedure of using a penis). Fertilisation occurs inside
					her body (in vivo) in the usual manner and need not involve
					any alteration of her hormonal cycles. The manipulation of
					sperm happens outside the male body. This set of technologies
					does not interfere with the regular functioning of the body. It
					may not need much medical supervision. The technology is
					very rudimentary and can in fact be used by women and men
					themselves without the intervention of a medical professional.
				</p>
				<p>
					These technologies are very different in character from in
					vitro technologies. It might be technically correct to call both
					ARTs but they cannot be equated. Doing so undermines the
					graveness of in vitro technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In vitro fertilisation (IVF) means the egg is fertilised outside
					the body. For this, the egg has to be retrieved from the
					woman's body and fertilised, and the fertilised embryo has to
					be implanted into a body that has been prepared to nurture a
					pregnancy. Extraction of an egg is not a simple process, unlike
					normal sperm extraction. It needs medication which can
					have serious side effects and also minor surgery. Similarly the
					insertion of the embryo requires preparing a woman's body to
					receive it (usually with synthetic hormones). It also involves the
					use of procedures slightly more complex than those required
					for the insertion of sperm.
				</p>
				<p>
					In IVF, the woman giving the egg and the woman receiving the
					embryo might not be the same. In rare cases the egg could be
					made of parts contributed by two women. So it can involve
					chemically controlling, intervening in and manipulating two
					or more women's bodies. It means constantly monitoring the
					women, controlling their bodies with the help of the medical
					team and the use of technology, both chemical and surgical.
					This is where the power of science and technology is eulogised
					and this is where the maximum manipulation of technology
					happens.
				</p>
				<p>
					As ARTs are practised today, there is no standardisation of
					the drugs used, no proper documentation of the procedures,
					insufficient information for patients about the side effects of
					the drugs used, and no limit to the number of times a woman
					may be asked to go through the procedure. Doctors and clinics
					compete and boast of high success rates for less money. They
					do not disclose the fact that a "successful cycle" need not lead
					to a baby being born. They do not disclose the actual costs
					involved in the process <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="For a very brief but fairly comprehensive list of side effects of these interventions see Cheap and Best: Analysis of websites, brochures and advertisements on assisted reproductive technologies in India. New Delhi: Sama - Resource Group for Women and Health; 2008. p 36." id="4">(4)</a>. They do not give exact information
					on the procedures and their possible side effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such malpractices are not addressed in the ART Bill. For the
					women whose bodies will be sites where these technologies
					and businesses operate, this is one of the biggest lacunae in the
					Bill. Checking infrastructure and record maintenance-which
					the Bill provides for-is no guarantee that the best medical
					procedure is followed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, the Rules with the Bill that lay down details of the
					nature of procedures, selection of patients and possible side
					effects assume that ART is being used only by a heterosexual
					infertile couple. So they specify indications for various
					techniques based on the nature of infertility <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="There is an attempt in the Bill at defining a couple as any two persons and yet every time there is a couple being mentioned in the Bill, what is meant is always a heterosexual, married couple. Similarly although technically single persons can use the technology, all along what is implied is that there is a married couple that is availing of the technology." id="5">(5)</a>. The side effects
					are underplayed as "ART procedures carry a small risk both to
					the mother and the offspring." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Page 67, section 6.13 on complications." id="6">(6)</a> Evidently the risk is "small" in
					comparison to the pain and trauma of infertility. In any case the
					use of fertile women's bodies for egg retrieval or for surrogacy
					does not figure in the discussion on risks.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bill has provided for many informed consent forms to
					be filled and records to be kept. But it does not require that
					adequate information is given to the people seeking ART or
					the surrogate. For example the consent form for couples asking
					for IVF and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) has only
					the following information about on the possible side effects:
					"The drugs that are used to stimulate the ovaries to raise
					oocytes have temporary side effects like nausea, headaches
					and abdominal bloating. Only in a small proportion of cases, a
					condition called ovarian hyperstimulation occurs where there is
					an exaggerated ovarian response. Such cases can be identified
					ahead of time but only to a limited extent. Further, at times the
					ovarian response is poor or absent in spite of using a high dose
					of drugs. Under these circumstances, the treatment cycle will
					be cancelled." <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Form D page 81 of the ART (regulation) Bill, 2008. The only other information that is given is about how the technique may not succeed and that there is no guarantee that there shall be a pregnancy." id="7">(7)</a> Is this adequate or even indicative of the kind
					of problems that are possibly in store? And even this is not part
					of the informed consent form for the surrogate who might go
					through the same procedure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Low temperature preservation</h4>
				<p>
					There is another aspect of ARTs-cryopreservation-which
					involves technology. Various types of germ cells are created
					and extracted from the human body using ARTs. Sperm
					are extracted (all of which may or may not be used), eggs
					are removed from women's bodies after super ovulation
					(sometimes as many as 14 or 15 per cycle), all of which may
					not be used for fertilisation, and embryos are generated after
					fertilisation (sometimes seven to eight per cycle), all of which
					may not be inserted for continuation of pregnancy. These are
					inevitable by-products of these technologies <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="This is similar to the ways in which multiple pregnancies are by-products of these technologies. Since every embryo inserted may not result in a pregnancy, many embryos are inserted at a time into a woman's body. There is at present no limit on the number of embryos that may be inserted into a woman' body. Very often more than one embryo result in pregnancies and that is the secret behind the miracle of multiple pregnancies! Similarly, as each cycle of super ovulation is physically taxing, drugs are administered so that many eggs mature and can beextracted in one cycle." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is possible to preserve these by-products and use them later.
					They can be used for reproduction or in research laboratories
				</p>
				<p>
					So arrangements have to be made and technology used to
					create the temperatures at which this preservation is possible.
					These germ cells are stored for future use in "banks" which
					function much in the same way that ordinary banks do where
					resources can be stored and saved by individuals to use when
					needed by them or by someone else. Sperm banks have existed
					for some time now where sperm are cryopreserved and from
					where individuals can get "safe and matching" sperm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new bill acknowledges that the low temperature facilities
					are for more than sperm. And so they have renamed these
					facilities - but instead of "germ cell banks" they have been
					renamed "semen banks"!! The proposed "semen banks" will
					preserve sperm, eggs and embryos and also be places for
					registering surrogates. One wonders if this nomenclature is
					a result of careless drafting or a patriarchal mindset which
					assumes that only the male's contribution results in life and
					not the "inactive" egg inside an even more "inactive" woman's
					body. I hope it is the former but I am almost certain that it is
					a combination of both and this makes the proposed bill more
					suspect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, there are no specifications about the nature of
					equipment, staff or facilities that the "semen banks" ought to
					have. While they are treated in this lackadaisical manner these
					banks are entrusted to advertise for and source donors of
					oocytes and sperm and surrogates as well.
					The worst, however, is reserved for the definition of surrogacy
					and how this social reality is addressed by the bill.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Restricted surrogacy</h4>
				<p>
					The bill defines surrogacy as an "arrangement in which a
					woman agrees to a pregnancy, achieved through assisted
					reproductive technology, in which neither of the gametes
					belongs to her or her husband, with the intention to carry it
					to term and hand over the child to the person or persons for
					whom she is acting as a surrogate; and a 'surrogate mother' is
					a woman who agrees to have an embryo generated from the
					sperm of a man who is not her husband and the oocyte of
					another woman, implanted in her to carry the pregnancy to full
					term and deliver the child to its biological parent(s)"
				</p>
				<p>
					By this definition, all surrogacy arrangements that involve
					the woman bearing a child using her egg (oocyte) and
					the commissioning man's sperm are illegal. The definition
					underlines the fact that the surrogate mother is not the
					biological parent thus emphasising that only those that
					contribute the genetic material can be considered to be
					biological parents. The fact that a human body nurtures the
					pregnancy has, according to this Bill, nothing to do with
					biology.
				</p>
				<p>
					By this definition fertile surrogate mothers will necessarily have
					to use technology meant for treatment of infertility. Surrogates
					will now be forced to use only the second set of technologies
					and not the first, even though they can get pregnant with
					methods like artificial insemination which are much safer for
					them. The need to hide conceal the identity of the gamete
					donor emphasises that the child's parentage is understood to
					be a product of the genes. It underlines the perspective that
					the nurture in the biological body has no role to play. So the
					surrogate is just a womb that has to be prepared to receive the
					embryo.
				</p>
				<p>
					Registration of surrogates with a "semen bank" further
					underlines the fact that the surrogate is seen as another
					component of the technology - a womb. In true reductionist
					science paradigm, a child is made with the help of a sperm, an
					oocyte and a womb. Just as the semen bank looks for donors
					of eggs, sperm or zygotes, it is also entitled to advertise for
					and register surrogates. This ignores the fact that while the
					donated egg or zygote gets separated from the woman's body,
					the womb continues to stay inside her and thus has to must be
					looked at differently. For this one would need to treat women
					as human beings and not just child-bearing devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact what is incomprehensible is why this Bill talks about
					surrogacy at all. The Bill is about regulation of assisted
					reproductive technology which it defines as "all techniques that
					attempt to obtain a pregnancy by handling or manipulating the
					sperm or the oocyte outside the human body, and transferring
					the gamete or the embryo into the uterus".
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the technology is concerned with a human body and
					a uterus, why should a clinic, a doctor, and a giver of such
					technology be concerned with which human body and which
					uterus? Does it matter if the uterus belongs to a woman who
					is married and is carrying her "husband's" child or to one who
					is married but not carrying her "husband's" child? Does the
					provider of the technology need to know what kind of legal
					contract she has made with the man whose sperm contributed
					to the embryo-that of marriage or that of surrogacy? Do the
					health concerns vary with the reasons for pregnancy? If not,
					then why then does the Bill put a limit on the number of times
					that an embryo transfer can be done for a surrogate but not so
					for other women?
				</p>
				<p>
					A surrogacy contract, much like a marriage contract, is definitely
					needed to protect the woman's rights. The question is: does
					this need to be put under the ART Bill? The inclusion here just
					underlines the idea that women are baby producing machines,
					if not in their avatars as wives then definitely as surrogate
					mothers. A Bill that is meant to safeguard the provider and the
					commissioning couple (because they are seeking to produce
					children through methods that are not normally used / by "non
					normative" means) will not protect the rights of the surrogate.
					She is the most marginalised and vulnerable in this triad. Her
					rights need to be protected, but not under a Bill that regulates
					technology. We need to oppose the inclusion of surrogates'
					rights within this same Bill and also oppose this definition of
					surrogacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the commissioning parents do not provide the gametes,
					donors are kept secret presumably so that the rights of the
					child are protected. With or without technology, there are
					many disputes around parentage of children. There are many
					instances when the gamete donors, especially the legalhusbands of the mothers of the children, have not fulfilled
					their responsibility towards the children and/or questioned
					the paternity of the child. These are issues that are social in
					nature. They will come up however much we try and deny the
					surrogate mother the right to be mother in the first place and
					define parentage only through the genes. A woman should not
					have to go through the range of in vitro technologies just to
					ensure that she is not also the genetic parent for fear of future
					legal problems.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The debates within</h4>
				<p>
					Finally, if the rights of surrogates are not taken care of in this Bill,
					how are we going to ensure that these rights are protected? For
					that we must first acknowledge that surrogacy is another name
					for reproductive labour that women have always done <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="In any case all women can be considered to be surrogates for their husband's children. How else do we explain the fact that the moment a child is born she gets the father's name and guardianship? The mother is not taken to be the natural guardian. Until very recently children were also assumed to be as much a property of the father as the woman herself. Every mother is paid for this labour in society in kind and in status." id="9">(9)</a>.
					Through these technologies when the emphasis is once again
					on the germ cell and gamete theory of children and everyone
					is under a moral pressure to have "a child of their own", the
					surrogate who asks for monetary compensation and voluntarily
					gives her child to someone else to nurture is probably the only
					subversive element in the story.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a caste ridden, hierarchical, patriarchal society such as
					ours, adoption of children is a process that helps break many
					norms of caste and lineage. Even though the Bill mentions
					adoption and doctors state that they offer adoption as an
					option right at the beginning, these technologies and those
					providing it them actually underplay adoption. The availability
					of these technologies itself pushes people to try and have
					their "own child" rather than adopt. Considering the amount
					of money that providers make and the credit that they get for
					"providing children in people's lives", it is hard to imagine that
					they would even suggest adoption before having milked these
					opportunities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet there is a minor but subversive potential in these
					technologies. They can be used by all those who are socially
					not allowed to have children of their own. They also allow
					for the possibility of multiple parents-the gamete donors,
					the pregnancy-nurturing mother, and the parents in whose
					guardianship the child grows up. Of these the smallest role
					is actually that of the gamete donors. The surrogate/woman
					who carries the pregnancy is an important part of the child's
					life. And she, in her act of getting pregnant with the conscious
					decision of not nurturing the child beyond birth, redefines
					motherhood, lineage, and reproductive labour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course this perspective raises new issues to resolve.
					Acknowledging surrogacy as legitimate labour and permitting
					a market in surrogacy could push women back into their role
					as reproducers, thus endangering the hard-won gains that
					women have made to be more than mere reproducers. There is
					also the argument that surrogacy will encourage exploitation
					of poor women as cheap labour, available to all and sundry,
					especially for foreigners. Also, women's bodies will continue
					to be exploited through commercial control over their
					reproduction as they are already exploited through control
					over their sexuality.
				</p>
				<p>
					My response to such concerns is that the reproduction market
					and the consequent exploitation of women is a reality in all
					aspects of women's lives. It is a battle to be fought at a larger
					level. It cannot be fought over an individual's very limited
					"choice" of using that market potential to her full ability
					through using whatever sells best-physical, reproductive, or
					sexual labour. By creating a hierarchy of legitimacy between
					these various kinds of labour, we allow for a moral edge to our
					arguments that makes the surrogate even more vulnerable
					than she already is. Instead of talking of the rights and wrongs
					of surrogacy we need to find out more about who these
					surrogates are and what they need to deal with the forces
					in this burgeoning industry, where technocrats are called
					doctors, businesses are called clinics and clients are called
					commissioning parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until the voices of these women are heard and concrete
					demands emerge from their experiences, let the Bill do just
					what its name indicates that it should do-regulate technology
					not human beings.
