				<h4>Consumer rights as  applied to vaccine usage in  India</h4>
				<p>
					The  eight consumers' rights as defined by the <strong>International Organization of Consumers' Union</strong> are  as follows :
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to safety</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be protected against products, production processes and  services which are hazardous to health or life. The right to safety has been  broadened to include the concern for consumers' long-term interests, not only  their immediate desires. Vaccines introduced in this country are cleared on the  basis of foreign trials and data. Safety and efficacy trials on Indian subjects  are done in a hurry just before licensing. These trials merely test antibody  responses and very few trials monitor adverse reactions over a prolonged period  of time
				</p>
				<p>
					There are virtually  no guidelines on what training personnel administering vaccines should undergo.  Camps are organised where ignorant people administer vaccines. Most fatalities  related to mass vaccination are due to ignorance by the staff. Storage of  vaccines is woefully inadequate; most centres administering vaccines do not  have the appropriate facilities to handle serious reactions to vaccines.  Dangerous vaccines are still available and are used on vulnerable segments of  our population &mdash; such as the whole brain rabies vaccine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaccine adverse  reaction monitoring systems are not available freely and very few physicians,  consumers or pharmaceutical companies use them.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to be informed</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be given the facts needed to make an informed choice or  decision. This goes beyond avoiding deception and protection against misleading  advertising, labeling or other practices. Consumers should be provided with  adequate information, enabling them to act wisely and responsibly. This is a  right which has been abused with regards to immunisation. On the one hand we  have a large populace of illiterate people whose children are subject to a  paternalistic system where they are not given information on any vaccine given  to their children. On the other hand, a barrage of half-baked truths is fed to  the educated, illiterate, urban rich, inducing them to immunise their children  against diseases for which we know neither the incidence nor the efficacy of  the vaccine in our population.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to choose</h5>
				<p>
					This  refers to access to a variety of products and services at competitive prices  and, in the case of monopolies, to have an assurance of satisfactory quality  and service at a fair price. The right to choose has been reformulated to read: <strong>the  right to basic goods and services</strong>. This is because the unrestrained right  of a minority to choose can mean for the majority a denial of its fair share.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here again we have  a populace who is utterly ignorant of its choices. Not only are there a number  of vaccines against various diseases, there are also a number of brands within  each vaccine, and with different combinations. Their costs vary, leaving the  medical profession and public confused. The assurance of the availability of  essential vaccines rests with the government. The government has taken  excellent initiative in making essential vaccines available. It is also a  credit to the government that the cost of importing vaccines is entirely borne  by the state and is not dependent on foreign aid.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to be heard</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be represented so that consumers' interest receives full and  sympathetic consideration in the formulation and execution of economic policy.  This right is being broadened to include the right to be heard and represented  in the development of products and services before they are produced or set up.  It also implies a representation, not only in government policies, but also in  those of other economic powers. This right should be invoked in the recent  controversy over the inclusion of the Hepatitis B vaccine in the national  immunisation programme. A thorough cost-benefit and risk benefit analysis  should be undertaken before introducing this vaccine. Just because the  vaccine's cost is coming down and it is being indigenously manufactured does  not automatically mean that it should be introduced in the national programme.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to redressal</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to a fair settlement of just claims. This right has been  generally accepted since the early 1970s. It involves the right to receive  compensation for misrepresentation or shoddy goods or services. Where needed,  free legal aid or an accepted form of redress for small claims should be  available. This right unfortunately is not available to most of our population.  There is no vaccine injury compensation programme. The legal rights are also  not very clear. With the passage of the CPA, this may change.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to consumer education</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to acquire the knowledge and skills to be an informed consumer  throughout one's life. The right to consumer education incorporates the right  to the knowledge and skills needed for taking action to influence factors which  affect consumer decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Very little is done  to educate the populace on vaccines and their effects or adverse reactions.  With a large population, differing literacy levels and a multiplicity of  languages, mass communication is a challenging task
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to a healthy environment</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to a physical environment that will enhance the quality of  life. This right involves protection against environmental problems over which  the individual consumer has control. It acknowledges the need to protect and  improve the environment for present and future generations. Provision of clean  drinking water is probably more important than immunising the entire population  against typhoid or hepatitis A.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to basic needs</h5>
				<p>
					The  right to basic needs means that availability of articles which are the basic  need of every consumer must be ensured. Vaccines should be classified as a  basic need and exempt from taxes. The government must pass laws to compel  essential vaccines and provide for compensation for defined adverse reactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					There should also  be a political will to manufacture essential vaccines indigenously.
