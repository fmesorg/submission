					Communal  riots shook Bombay in two phases, first during December, 1992 (in the aftermath  of the demolition of Babari Masjid), and then in January 1993. As a surgeon  working in a public hospital which absorbed a large number of casualties during  the riots, I could observe distinct differences, between the two. The December  riots were 'expected to occur' after the demolition. All of us were ready for  the inevitable. Nobody expected the communal frenzy of January.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  were many injuries due to police firing during the December riots mainly  affecting the rioting, minority community. During the second phase the injured  were mainly from communal clashes. Few bullet wounds were encountered. Injuries  were principally from swords, blunt objects and kerosene burns.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  striking difference of course was in the gruesome stories which people came out  with during the second phase. Individuals were mentally tortured, beaten,  stabbed, tied up and burnt. The victims in their death throes looked up to the  hospital staff for some solace.

				<h4>Effects on doctors and other staff members in hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					During the second phase no one shaved off his beard initially but after  learning of male victims who were stripped naked to ascertain their religion,  no one wanted to take a chance. Many on the hospital staff too shaved off their  beards.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  expected the first phase to end soon and the police dealt a swift blow to  rioters. The second phase dragged on endlessly. All of us working in hospitals  were physically and mentally exhausted. The atmosphere was vicious and if it  had continued even a day further, communal frenzy would have irreversibly  entered into the hospital campus and its operation theatres.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  was total collapse of law and order. Ambulances were burnt within the hospital  compound. Killers chased their victims into the sacred precincts of the  operation theatre and stabbed them, then walked away coolly. One hapless fellow  had his head crushed in front of doctors and other hospital staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					What  impact these happenings had on the medical mind can only be guessed. All staff  members of public hospitals stayed scrupulously impartial in treating those  sent to them, irrespective of creed. Amidst the general madness that prevailed,  there is not a single instance of a doctor, nurse, technician or ward attendant  allowing a private sense of outrage to overwhelm behaviour towards a patient.

					Charlie  Chaplin, in the 'Great Dictator', said that killing of one human being is  construed as murder but the death of thousands is just statistics. Such  statistics were presented by some doctors in a recent medical conference.

				<h4>Our experiences in two refugee camps</h4>
				<p>
					After the riots some of us went out of the 'safe' precincts of the hospital  into the refugee camps at Goregaon and Malad. We found people huddled together  in a terrorised state. By profession they were pullers of carts, construction  workers, loaders, weavers and dyers of cloth. They had lived in Bombay for as  long as they could remember and were now orphans discarded by the city. Medical  help reached them too late and proved insuffrcient to heal their inner wounds.

					Kabir's  Doha tells us that the string symbolising love and peace can never be put  together seamlessly when it breaks into two. It will always have a knot in it.  As doctors we could only try to smoothen the knot a little.
