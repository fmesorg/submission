				<h4>Need to promote organ donation</h4>
				<p>
					After the enactment of the Transplantation of Human Organ
					Act, 1994, it appeared that the kidney bazaar had stopped
					at least in Maharashtra. However, 2004 started with exposes
					of kidney sale rackets <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S. The kidney trade again. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;1:36&ndash;7." id="1">(1)</a>. Organs that can be donated
					include kidneys, heart, liver, lungs and pancreas. Tissues
					that can be donated include corneas, skin, bones, bone
					marrow, connective tissue, and blood and blood vessels.
					The complete body also can be donated.
				</p>
				<p>
					As per the Act, a person can donate by one's free will to
					immediate blood relations (brother, sister, parents and
					children) OR to any person for whom donor possesses
					special affection, attachments, or some special reason.
					When alive, one can donate blood or bone marrow to any
					person and a part of the liver or skin or one of the two
					kidneys. Nothing else can be donated when one is alive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most deaths occur due to stopping of the heart&ndash;lung
					function. After such a death, the eyes and skin of the dead
					person can be donated even if she/he has not filled a
					pledge card. Eye donation should take place within four
					hours and skin donation within 12&ndash;24 hours after death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Death also can occur from cessation of brain functioning.
					A brain-dead person whose heart is beating can also
					donate organs and tissues before the heart stops beating.
					For body donation, one has to fill the donation form
					before death. In the absence of such a declaration, the
					nearest kin will have to make an affidavit to that effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are approximately 15,000 patients in Maharashtra
					with failure of both the kidneys. They depend on dialysis.
					Kidney transplantation is a better alternative for them. The
					annual number of transplants in Maharashtra since 1997 is
					just 320. Of these, only 20 come from brain-dead donors,
					200 from immediate relatives, and 100 from unrelated
					donors. The need for a kidney bazaar arose due to the large
					difference between demand and supply for kidneys.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, few relatives of brain-dead persons give
					permission for organ retrieval. The Zonal Transplant
					Control Committee in Mumbai and Pune have 225 and
					25 needy patients, respectively on the waiting list. Due
					to less number of donors in this category, one may have
					to wait for more than 5&ndash;10 years to get a kidney. This
					compels many of them to opt for live (related or
					unrelated) kidney donors.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are 31 approved hospitals for declaration of brain
					death and for kidney transplant in Maharashtra. It is estimated that a total of 100 brain deaths are identified in all
					the 31 hospitals annually, making available 200 kidneys
					every year. If even half of these kidneys were available for
					donation, it would bring down the demand for unrelated
					live donation. Close relatives of brain-dead people learn of
					the concept of brain death for the first time in a tragic
					situation. They do not believe that the heart is beating only
					because of a respirator and will stop anyway within two
					days. Hence, they deny the permission for organ retrieval.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though the Maharashtra government accepted the Act
					recognising brain death in 1995, the first kidney
					transplant from a brain-dead person took place two years
					later. The first liver transplant in Maharashtra from a
					brain-dead donor was carried out in 2002.
				</p>
				<p>
					Accepting kidney from a brain-dead person is the best
					way to avoid the kidney bazaar, especially in the
					developed world where almost all transplants are now
					carried out in this fashion. However, the concept of brain
					death is not that widespread in India. The ways to increase
					awareness about the concept of brain death and to
					propagate the organ donation movement, are listed below.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government does not keep information on the
					number of brain deaths, permissions for organ retrieval
					and number of organs retrieved. This would be useful for
					the organ donation movement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospitals retrieving organs from brain-dead persons
					should give publicity to the event. Patients waiting for
					organs are the beneficiaries of this effort and should take
					responsibility for raising awareness about brain death and
					canvassing for organ donation. Hospitals where patients are
					enrolled for organs should form support groups which
					should not leave any opportunity of canvassing for organ
					donation and explaining brain death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pledge cards for organ donation are available with
					hospitals authorised for organ transplant and with nongovernmental
					organisations such as the National Kidney
					Foundation, Mumbai (Tel. 22814892) and Narmada
					Kidney Foundation, Mumbai (Tel. 28368634).
