					Anyone with even an  elementary knowledge of medicine knows that, ideally, drugs should be  administered as single molecules based on the specific requirement of each  patient. This enables the prescriber to select specific drugs in specific  doses for specific durations. Only under exceptional circumstances are fixed  dose combinations (FDCs) allowed. These are when (a) two or more drugs have a  synergistic action, i.e. the combination acts to achieve a better therapeutic  response than the individual drugs alone; (b) there is corrective action, and  one drug acts to reduce the incidence and/or severity of adverse effects caused  by the other; (c) two or more molecules are normally needed and taken by the  patient concurrently - provided the dosage of each drug does not need to be  individualised, or (d) prescribing two or more drugs separately could result in  one of them not being ingested, and this would adversely affect the patient's  health.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even under such  situations care has to be taken to ensure that there are no adverse  interactions between the combined drugs, that the pharmacological behaviour  (absorption, duration of action, elimination) is not grossly different, that  the withdrawal of one of the agents does not lead to withdrawal symptoms and in  any event sub-therapeutic doses are never used. Conversely medicines cannot be  mixed if side effects are additive or they belong to the same group with  similar mode of action, such as two NSAIDs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are these precise and  scientifically sound guidelines being followed in permitting the combination of  drugs in our country? Certainly not. All sorts of bizarre combinations have  flooded the market. Many of them not only harm the patients, they can also  damage the health of entire communities in the future by promoting the  emergence of drug-resistant strains of micro-organisms. Take the example of  combining quinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) with imidazoles (e.g. tinidazole).  This combination is widely used, overused and misused for diarrhoea. Since most  cases of diarrhoea are due to viruses, suboptimal use is giving rise to  quinolone-resistant strains of typhoid germs.
				</p>

					Manufacturers' main  motive behind mixing drugs is, of course, to generate prescriptions and make  profits. One can hardly expect anything else if there are over 17,000 pharmaceutical  manufacturers, some 40,000 brands but only around 450 basic medicines. When  atenolol does not generate enough sales, it is mixed with alprazolam to create  an expensive 'novel' product. In the absence of research, the pharmaceutical  industry in India has been reduced to a purely commercial activity in which  marketing is the name of the game. It is no wonder that the basic principles of  pharmacology get pushed to the background.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result we have  combinations such as nimesulide with paracetamol (both with hepato-toxic  additive adverse effects); diclofenac (taken three times daily) with famotidine  (taken once daily); mebendazole (taken twice daily for three days) with  pyrantel (taken as a single dose), atenolol (taken once daily) with plain nifedipine  (taken two-three times daily), and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cisapride is combined  with omeprazole so that a patient who requires just omeprazole, a relatively  safe medicine, is also made to consume cisapride, a far more dangerous drug  which is banned in western countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the most absurd  fixed drug combinations are available in India. A few examples: nimesulide,  paracetamol and tizanidine; amoxycillin,probenecid and tinidazole; diazepam,  antacids and oxyphenonium. Over 70 dangerous FDCs are being sold in India under  more than 1,000 brand names.
				</p>
				<p>
					Who is responsible for  this mess of mixing incompatible medicines? We must blame the total lack of  accountability of the drug regulatory apparatus, and the existence of parallel  drug control centres in our country.
				</p>
				<p>
					All new molecules have  to be approved by the Drugs Controller General, India (DCGI). Once a new  molecule is licensed, the state drug controllers take over and monitor  pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities located in their own jurisdictions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legally, when two or  more individually approved drugs are combined, the mixed medicine is deemed to  be a 'new' product and hence requires DCGI approval. In practice, state drug  controllers merrily go on licensing such combinations -- even though they do  not have the legal powers to do so. Once one state drug controller approves a  combination, it can be sold all over the country. The result: a patient in,  say, Maharashtra consumes a drug that is neither approved by the DCGI nor by  the Maharashtra drug controller but by a drug controller in, say, Assam! Unless  state drug controllers are made to obey the law, no improvement can occur.
				</p>
				<p>
					The DCGI is no less  culpable. In a federal set-up he may hesitate to move against erring state  controllers but he has the power to ban such illegal combinations. He has  failed to do so. If the Central Government does not move quickly, the day is  not far off when courts will be compelled to move in to protect the health of  the people.
