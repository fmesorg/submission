					Modern biology, also  called molecular biology, biotechnology or genetic engineering, has witnessed  many technological and conceptual advances over the past two decades. The  foremost among these have been the Human Genome Project that enabled sequencing  of not just our own genetic material, but also the genomes of many  micro-organisms. However, as with any language, knowing the alphabet and being  able to read it does not necessarily mean that we understand this genetic  language. The next big step is to understand what our genes actually do.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sequencing of  genomes has thrown up many ethical, social and legal issues relating to  patenting (ownership) of genetic material and information, and accessibility of  this information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Science in its purest  form is value-neutral, but technologies that develop out of this knowledge  depend upon the intent of the user. It is society, the scientific establishment  and commercial interests that decide how to use that technology. Nuclear  technology can be used either for public good by providing an efficient source  of energy, or for large scale destruction in the form of nuclear bombs.  Biotechnology will be no different. While it is being used to find novel cures  and vaccines for many diseases, it also has the potential to create novel (and  dangerous) pathogens with devastating consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					This point was driven  home recently by the first chemical synthesis of a human pathogen, in this case  poliovirus <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cello J, Paul A V, Wimmer E.

				<h4>Chemical synthesis of poliovirus</h4>
				<p>
					Many viruses, including  poliovirus, are simple consisting of some genetic material (RNA or DNA)  surrounded by a protein coat. The genetic material instructs the virus-infected  cells to produce more viruses. So, if one were to produce the viral RNA or DNA  and put it in a proper cell, new viruses would be produced. This has been  accomplished for many viruses, using genetic material derived from a natural  virus. The recent work has gone a step further by chemically synthesising the  viral genome, thus obviating the need for a template derived from a natural  virus.
				</p>
				<p>
					The poliovirus genome  consists of 7500 chemical units (bases or nucleotides) of RNA. Since chemical  synthesis of RNA is far more difficult than DNA, the complete poliovirus genome  was first assembled as a DNA copy. This was accomplished by stitching together  chemically synthesised pieces of DNA (called oligonucleotides), using a routine  enzyme-driven in vitro process. The chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides is  also a standard and automated process that is used by thousands of laboratories  the world over. Further, these short pieces of DNA can be ordered from any of  the numerous mail-order companies for as little as 40-50 cents (about Rs.  20-25) per base.
				</p>
				<p>
					The DNA was then  converted into RNA in a test tube using a commercially available enzyme. This  RNA, which would be identical to poliovirus genomic RNA, was then put into a  mixture of proteins derived from cells. Such a mixture of proteins capable of  supporting the replication of poliovirus RNA and generation of new virus  particles has been known since the early 1990s. In this cell-free protein  system, the synthetic poliovirus RNA produced viral proteins that were  identical to those produced by poliovirus-infected cells. Further, when  incubated with intact cells, the mixture was able to form plaques indicative of  viral infection that were identical to those produced by natural poliovirus. In  further tests to determine specificity and pathogenic nature of the synthesised  virus, it was neutralised by poliovirus-specific immune sera and produced  neurovirulence in a transgenic mouse model of poliovirus infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, synthetic  poliovirus genetic material was able to produce viable virus that was identical  to natural poliovirus. This was accomplished without using either a template or  an intact living cell. This is the first example of chemical synthesis of a  virus from scratch.
				</p>

				<h4>Is such work necessary?</h4>
				<p>
					This is a question  society will have to consider, just as it did in the '70s when recombinant DNA  technology was discovered and applied, or very recently when Dolly was cloned  making way for possible cloning of human beings. Craig Venter, who led the  private effort to sequence the human genome, says, "I think it's  inflammatory, without scientific justification. To purposely make a synthetic  human pathogen is irresponsible." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pollack A. Scientists create a live polio virus. New York Times, July 12, 2002." id="2">(2)</a> He adds that "this work should  never have been done, funded, or published; somehow the whole system broke down  here." <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cook G. Experts build polio virus, raise new terrorism fears. The Denver Post, July 12, 2002." id="3">(3)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					There are more immediate  questions that we should address. Did this work teach us something we did not  already know? Does it extend the frontiers of science? Some would say 'no'  'because we already knew that oligonucleotides can be assembled into genes,  that DNA can be transcribed in vitro into RNA and that poliovirus RNA can  produce virus particles when incubated with an appropriate cell extract. The  present work has simply put the entire recipe together. However, others would  argue that this is conceivably the first chemical synthesis (creation) of life  in a test tube. Given the current state of knowledge, this work is not  insightful enough to be published in a major scientific journal which claims to  publish only paradigm-shifting findings.

				<h4>Implications for public health</h4>
				<p>
					The 1988 World Health  Assembly resolved to eradicate poliovirus from the globe by the year 2000,  making this the second human pathogen after smallpox targeted for eradication.  Due to sustained global immunisation programmes, this goal has largely been  achieved with 99% of the world being declared polio-free in 2000 <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="www.who.org" id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can polio immunisation  ever be discontinued? Analogous to the strategy used after smallpox  eradication, it is planned to stop polio immunisations a few years after its  eradication. However, in view of this new research, can we ever afford to do  that? Vaccinations might still be needed to protect against use of synthetic  poliovirus as a bioweapon. "This just says we're going to have to sustain  some immunisation for the indefinite future," says D A Henderson, principal  adviser on public health preparedness to the U S government <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pollack A. Scientists create a live polio virus. New York Times, July 12, 2002." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Would poliovirus make a  good bioweapon? Probably not. A good bioweapon would be distributed through  aerosols, have high rates of infectivity and mortality, and the target  population should be immunologically na√Øve to it. Poliovirus does not satisfy  these criteria. It is transmitted through food, only 0.1-0.5% of exposed people  suffer paralysis and most of the world's population has been vaccinated against  it. However, viruses such as Ebola and smallpox fit this bill perfectly. While  technology does not exist today to chemically synthesise these more complicated  viruses, no one anticipated ten years ago that poliovirus could be synthesised  from scratch. Barry Bloom, dean, Harvard School of Public Health comments:  "This should really raise some red flags. It means that more complicated  viruses can be created - and that it is also possible to create viruses that do  not exist in the wild" <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cook G. Experts build polio virus, raise new terrorism fears. The Denver Post, July 12, 2002." id="3">(3)</a>. The real value of this work would be in  helping public health systems to be realistic about assessing future threats.

				<h4>The practice and reporting of biomedical research</h4>
				<p>
					The ability to freely  report and exchange information has been a crucial part of public health. Shall  we still enjoy the freedom to do so?
				</p>
				<p>
					"Can scientific  journals become cookbooks for terrorists by providing easy recipes for  assembling germs that could be unleashed easily on people?" asks an  article in a national daily <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain K. Science journals censored against terror. Times of India, September 11, 2002." id="5">(5)</a>. In the post-September 11 world such questions  will be asked. The same article quotes the respected British medical journal  <em>Lancet</em>: "Advances in microbiology can eventually facilitate cures for  diseases, but a dedicated terrorist can figure out how to use that same  information for harm" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain K. Science journals censored against terror. Times of India, September 11, 2002." id="5">(5)</a>. Consequently, reviewers have been asked to  alert editors should they find potentially problematic material in the papers  they are reviewing. The U S House of Representatives is looking at a resolution  that asks editors of scientific journals to 'exercise restraint' in publishing  such material <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain K. Science journals censored against terror. Times of India, September 11, 2002." id="5">(5)</a>. A more appropriate request should have been made to the  United States Defense Department, which funded this research, to exercise  caution in funding such research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Wimmer is quoted as  saying, "If it is not done by sensible scientists, then it will be done by  terrorists." <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cook G. Experts build polio virus, raise new terrorism fears. The Denver Post, July 12, 2002." id="3">(3)</a> What arrogance! Would this science still be 'sensible' if  it was done outside of the United States, let's say in India or Brazil?  However, biomedical scientists working in countries such as India may face  problems in freely conducting their research. The CEO of Integrated DNA  Technologies, the company that synthesised the oligonucleotides for the polio  research, is quoted as saying that they are now considering checking sequences  ordered by customers against a database of pathogens <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pollack A. Scientists create a live polio virus. New York Times, July 12, 2002." id="2">(2)</a>.
			  </p>
				<p>
					I am a virologist  working on hepatitis viruses and HIV and I routinely mail-order  oligonucleotides for my work. Will I now be considered a potential terrorist  who may be synthesising these viruses in my backyard? The real danger is from  the hype that such work is able to generate. This may then be used by vested  interests to create national or regional barriers in the practice of science.
				</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The reported chemical  synthesis of a human pathogen has raised many questions that society as a whole  and the biomedical community in particular, will have to address. Is this going  to be the route to new kinds of terrific genetically engineered bioterror, or  is this just a stunt? Will it help the world be realistic about assessing  future threats, or is it going to push an already paranoid world into creating  barriers for research and advocating censorship of publications? Many of these  issues will have to be addressed sooner than later.
