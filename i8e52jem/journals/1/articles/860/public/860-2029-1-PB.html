				<h4>Medical conferences</h4>
				<p>
					Please refer to the January 2003 issue of IME. The letter from Sevagram was  positive. There has been a palpable change in medical conferences over the  years. The number has increased manifold, the venue has shifted from medical  colleges to five-star hotels. The quality of food offered has improved while  that of the papers proffered has declined. The ultimate success of the  conference is judged more by the banquet, where there is a free flow of  alcohol. There are gifts galore at the exhibition stalls with prizes for lucky  dips.
				</p>
				<p>
					Smaller continuing medical education (CME) programmes can be organized  without sponsors as participants do not mind making a contribution if the  organ-izer is sincere and the lecture is of common interest. The local  chapter of the Indian Association of Pathologists and Microbiologists (IAPM) is  funded entirely by its members numbering about fifty. We are able to get good  speakers from neighbouring places. Recently, Professor RK Gupta from Sanjay  Gandhi Postgraduate Institute (SGPGI), Lucknow, who is the national president  of the IAPM, gave an excellent talk on interpretation of kidney biopsy. The  talk was much appreciated, especially by younger pathologists and trainees.

					At  the Allahabad branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), a team of young  doctors has started Sunday breakfast meetings. These meetings are well  attended, the speakers are usually good, but the sumptuous breakfast is a  guaranteed attraction, and is sponsored by one or the other drug company.  Things will change only with the active involvement of institutions and  organizers.

				<h4>The ECT debate: a response</h4>
				<p>
					I have gone through the article 'Unmodified ECT: ethical issues' by  Chittaranjan Andrade <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECTs: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;XI:9-10." id="1">(1)</a> which appeared in IME Vol. XI, no. 1 (p. 9-10). In the  event of the voluntary organization Saarthak filing a PIL in the Supreme Court  <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Writ Petition(C)(Supreme Court) 334/2201 with Writ Petition (C) 562/2001." id="2">(2)</a> demanding a ban on unmodified (administered without anaesthesia) ECT, this  article is significant because of its clarity and strength of arguments in  discussing the various relevant issues. I agree with the article in its  entirety.
				</p>
				<p>
					I agree with Dr Andrade  <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECTs: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;XI:9-10." id="1">(1)</a> that ECT is as relevant today as it was six decades ago when it was  invented. ECT continues to hold on to its important position in the therapeutic  armamentarium by virtue of its remarkable efficacy, rapidity of therapeutic  effect and safety.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a life-saving  treatment in severe depression, a condition in which 15% of untreated patients  are known to commit suicide <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ager J. Clinical manifestations of psychiatric disorders: comprehensive textbook of psychiatry. Vol. 1. 7th ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000:813." id="3">(3)</a>. Almost every psychiatrist has had the  unfortunate experience of one or more of his patients dying due to suicide in  situations where ECT, as a treatment modality, is withheld for some reason.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also agree with Dr  Andrade that the risk:benefit ratio of unmodified ECT is heavily tilted in  favour of ECT. Even if administered unmodified, only a very small proportion of  patients have complications. Tharyan et al.'s <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of exper-ience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="4">(4)</a> data show that only 12 out of  13,597 ECT treatments were associated with fracture. Considering the number of  suicides or the psychological morbidity that unmodified ECTs can prevent, the  rate of potential complications is not substantial.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider a scenario in  which the first-degree relative of a psychiatrist either has a suicidal  depression or a florid, aggressive psychosis and the former has no facility to  administer anaesthesia with the ECT. I am fairly certain that this close  relative-patient will be administered unmodified ECT by most psychiatrists!
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, where  resources often fall short of demands, a large number of mentally ill patients  will be denied the benefits of ECT if unmodified ones are banned. Such patients  are likely to be in one of the following situations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						where no anaesthesiologists are       available;
					</li>
					<li>
						where the patients cannot       afford the additional expenditure of anaesthesia;
					</li>
					<li>
						where administration of       anaesthesia can pose a medical risk; and
					</li>
					<li>
						where administering anaesthesia       is practically difficult due to a large number of such patients being        posted for ECTs, e.g. in mental hospitals.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Thus, any legislation  against unmodified ECTs will be an injustice to a large number of the mentally  ill in India, with potentially disastrous consequences for the patients and their  families. Dr Max Fink <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Max Fink (personal communication). 'Current status of ECTs', The MASTERMIND Seminar, Hotel Meridian, Mumbai, September 9, 2002." id="5">(5)</a>, an American psychiatrist and an international  authority on ECT, said during his recent visit to India: 'If we have to choose  between a modified ECT and an unmodified one for a seriously mentally ill  patient, the choice is certainly a modified one. But if the option is between  an unmodified ECT and 'no ECT', without doubt, it has be an unmodified ECT.'
