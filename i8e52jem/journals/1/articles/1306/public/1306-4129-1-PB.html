					Unlike in the West, few  of our medical professional bodies have bothered to lay down guidelines or to  implement them. Nor are there any serious attempts to set standards in any  field. The National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories,  New Delhi (NABL), has been in existence for a long time, but has had its scope  widened about three years ago to include clinical laboratories. In this time  frame, only three laboratories -- all in the private sector -- in  the country have been accredited. Interestingly, the institutions to which the  members themselves belong, are themselves not among the three. Accreditation is  currently not compulsory (unlike in the West). However, as Dr  Kanangasabhapathy, one of the convenors, states, "It is better to get your  laboratory accredited when it is voluntary than when it is compulsory."
				</p>
				<p>
					A  meeting on the topic of accreditation of laboratories was recently held at a  private diagnostic laboratory in Bangalore. Many pathologists and laboratory  physicians attended this informal meet where they were able to clarify their  doubts and clear misconceptions. A substantial number were persuaded by the  speakers to consider applying for the accreditation programme, after, of  course, completing the necessary paperwork. Although there is a long way to go,  this is at least an encouraging beginning.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same meeting, a Dr  Bhattacharya, a non-medical person associated with the NABL, made a comment:  "Medicine is now a semi-noble profession." Indeed, it is so. The other  word, apart from 'noble', used for centuries to describe the medical profession  -- 'learned'-- is also in danger of being in disuse, because of past misuse.
				</p>

					Most of the people attending the seminar were those from the private set-up,  either with their own laboratories or from the corporate hospitals. I suspect  that &ndash; as and when the ruling does come into force &ndash; government establishments  will be exempt from it. After all, even with the COPRA, government hospitals  are not covered under the Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a matter of shame that such a meeting has to be held by a private medical  establishment and not in a government hospital. This establishment, by the way,  is one the best known ones in the city and state and maintains excellent  standards.. For instance, their library (yes, a foreign concept to many in  private practice) would shame most 'leading' Indian medical libraries.

					Contrast this with two separate news items that have appeared in the newspapers  recently. In mid-April, it was reported that the Karnataka cabinet had approved  of a new medical college and had increased seats in various medical and dental  colleges across the state. (A proposal for an Ayurveda college in Mangalore,  though, was rejected). Twenty-one new medical colleges will be given  Essentiality certificates soon. The Karnataka Junior Doctors Association and  the Indian Medical Association oppose this because it will be detrimental to  the interests of doctors and would create unfair competition among doctors.  While the Bhore Committee had recommended a doctor: population ratio of 1:3,000  (and WHO recommends 1:3,500), it is already 1:1,100. Besides, according to the  Mudaliar Committee's criteria, there should be only 12 medical colleges in the  state (one medical college with 100 seats for a population of 50 lakh).  Currently, there are 2,700 new doctors graduating every year from 23 colleges.  Twenty-one more colleges &ndash; help!
				</p>
				<p>
					A report about a month and a half later is telling : two medical colleges &ndash; the  Father Muller's Medical College, Mangalore and the Khwaja Bande Nawaz  Institute, Gulbarga &ndash; have been barred from admitting students to the MBBS  course for the academic year 2001-2002. Further details are, unfortunately, not  given.

					An article in <em>The Hindu</em> refers to the fact that doctors often keep their patients waiting. This of  course has been true for decades and most doctors &ndash; and many patients,  unfortunately &ndash; explain it away by saying: "Was caught up in an  emergency". This is undoubtedly true in some cases, particularly say, when  a surgery takes longer than expected. The vast majority, unfortunately, simply  don't care. "Patients must learn to be patient," as somebody recently  said to me. Many doctors give appointments to patients knowing fully well that  they will be elsewhere at that time. Principle 10 of the Code of Medical  Ethics, 1972, states, "A physician should endeavour to add to the comfort  of the sick by making visits at the hour indicated to the patients."

					As I write this, I learn that the Prime Minister's knee replacement will be  performed in a few hours. This time the hype seems to be less than last year.  Why is this? Probably because the newspapers have said all that one needs to  know about knee replacements already. That the Prime Minister's office has not  paid heed to the beliefs of those few people who voiced their views that the  Indian PM should ideally be operated in India by an Indian citizen, is, of  course, obvious.
				</p>
				<p>
					No such problem for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha. Today's newspaper mentions  that he will undergo renal surgery while in the USA later this week. Apparently  Indian urologists are not yet 'there'.
