				<h4>Quill TE. Dying and decision making&mdash;evolution of  end-of-life options. N Engl J Med 2004;350:2029-32.</h4>
				<p>
					The  author describes the choices that he and his family made to make his father's  death peaceful. His father's condition had begun to deteriorate rapidly from an  ill-defined dementing illness. The father had made his wishes clear: he did not  want to prolong dying. The family struggled to find a way to honour the  father's wishes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  past 13 years, palliative care has come to focus on relief of uncomfortable  symptoms and improving the quality of life for severely ill patients and their  families. Unlike hospice care, palliative care is offered alongside the active  treatment of a patient's underlying disease, regardless of the prognosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospices  only accept patients with less than six months to live, who are willing to  forgo all treatments. Unfortunately, patients like to receive some potentially  effective treatments even when the chances of success are low. Therefore, few  dying patients receive hospice care. Recently, hospices broadened their  criteria to include patients with end-stage illnesses lasting longer than six  months. The author's father was accepted into one such local community hospice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discussions  about last-resort practices have also evolved. Although the US Supreme Court  had ruled in 1997 that there was no constitutionally protected right to  physician-assisted suicide (PAS), the court indicated that it would not  interfere with state-based efforts at legalisation. The justices were concerned  about the current inadequacies of access to and delivery of palliative care,  and about the absence of empirical data of the risks and benefits of  legalisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  Oregon, where PAS was legalised by referendum in 1998, it has accounted for  less than 0.1% of deaths per year. Most of these patients had been enrolled in  hospice programmes. They were primarily motivated to choose PAS by loss of  autonomy, loss of control of their bodily functions, decreased ability to enjoy  life and tiredness of waiting to die. Unrelieved pain and clinical depression  were never a factor. This is an important point as groups that oppose PAS have  insisted that if these two factors are adequately addressed, there would be no need  for PAS.
				</p>
				<p>
					What  might be the other last-resort options available to patients like the author's  father? Table 1 from the <em>New England Journal of Medicine,</em> shows the five main  options in rough order of consensus about acceptability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  author's father had been a staunch advocate of choice at the end of life.  Because he had now lost the capacity to make decisions for himself, the family  had to decide on his behalf. In collaboration with the hospice team, his  primary physician and other consultants, the family elected to try low-dose  phenobarbital to reduce his relentless agitation and insomnia. With this mild  sedation, he appeared more peaceful. He awakened periodically to exchange a few  words, but he almost completely stopped eating and drinking. He died peacefully  five days later.

				<h4>Commentary</h4>
				<p>
					By the late 1970s, Americans became concerned with the high cost of dying (80%  of the total individual life-long health care expenditure occurs in the last  year of life). The futility of the expenditure and the undignified impersonal  lonely death in an ICU led to the passage of the 'death with dignity' laws that  required hospitals to ascertain the patient's wishes (advance directives and  DNR [do not resuscitate] orders) at the time of admission <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cassel CK. ICD-9 code for palliative or terminal care. N Engl J Med 1996;335:1232-4." id="1">(1)</a>. The logical  conclusion of this trend was the approval, by referendum, twice, of the Oregon  Physician Assisted Suicide law in 1997 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sullivan AD, Hedberg K, Hopkins D. Legalized physician-assisted suicide in Oregon, 1998-2000. N Engl J Med 2001;344:605-7." id="2">(2)</a>.

					When a  conservative government committed to 'right to life' came to power in 2000, the  Federal government challenged the constitutionality of the law. In April, an  appeals court dismissed the government's suit saying that the voters had  approved the bill by referendum, and the Federal government had no legal basis  to challenge the will of the people of Oregon.

				<h4>How is this article relevant to India?</h4>
				<p>
					The life expectancy for people of India has been increasing steadily. This is  particularly true for most of the middle class where life expectancy is rapidly  approaching that of their counterparts in the West. Inevitably, we see many more  elderly patients with debilitating chronic illnesses such as terminal chronic  heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD),  malignancies and dementias. Many such patients need 24-hour care for several  months. Most are cared for by their families and/or hired caregivers when  families can afford them. Our social ethos and family structure still enable  most people to die peacefully at home.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients  and families are clear that it is not death that they are afraid of&mdash;it is the  process of dying that terrifies them. Of the options mentioned in the table,  the first two could be done at home when there is a clear understanding between  the doctor and patient/family. Patients may refuse nourishment towards the end  and this too can be managed at home as has been done in the USA <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Quill TE, Lo B, Brock DW. Palliative options of last resort: a comparison of voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, terminal sedation, physician-assisted suicide, and voluntary active euthanasia. JAMA 1997;278:2099-104." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ganzini L, Goy ER, Miller LL, Harvath TA, Jackson A, Delrot MA. Nurses' experiences with hospice patients who refuse food and fluids to hasten death. N Engl J Med 2003;349:359-65." id="4">4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many  families are emotionally unable to handle the prolonged suffering of their  loved ones and want to take the patient to a local hospital to ease the  suffering. What happens next depends on the level of communication between the  doctor and patient/family. The family may run into a situation where the  doctors, under the impression that they are legally required to do so, may use  high-tech medicine to keep the patient alive, even if the patient and family  don't really want it. Doctors have been accused of using aggressive measures  simply to make more money! Often, doctors get confusing and contradictory  requests from a large extended family. Few patients designate a single person  as their surrogate to make health care decisions in case they get  incapacitated. In such a situation, the doctors and hospital administrators do  not want to withhold treatment in case this leads to filing of a law suit later  by an aggrieved relative whose wishes were ignored.
				</p>
				<p>
					Terminal  patients need a hospice that provides comfort care, rather than a hospital  which provides aggressive medical care. Many readers of this Journal may agree  that we do need such nursing care facilities as the nuclear families, which are  increasing in number, are unable to handle the 24-hour care for weeks. Hospice  personnel make home visits to assist the family or administer the needed  treatment within the hospice facility itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is reluctance on the part of both the medical community as well as the patient/family  to talk about distressing details. Doctors need to start talking to patients  and their family about the futility of treatments that only prolong death.  Until this major block is overcome, we will not be able to proceed to the next  step&mdash;putting the wishes of the patient in writing such that they are legally  binding on the medical profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advance  directives, such as no extraordinary life-sustaining measures, need the backing  of laws to be enforceable in medical institutions. We also need to educate  people about the advisability of awarding power of attorney for health care to  a trusted family member. This person can liaise between the medical staff and  patient/family to make appropriate decisions and submit a copy of the advance  directives, if needed. These decisions have to be made widely known among the  family members, so unseemly and emotionally unsettling squabbles are avoided  towards the end.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  US, where most care is paid for by third-party payers such as insurance  companies or the government itself, the payers have a strong incentive for  avoiding futile expenditure. Thus, laws were enacted to facilitate DNR orders  and advance directives. What will be the stimulus for such changes in India?
