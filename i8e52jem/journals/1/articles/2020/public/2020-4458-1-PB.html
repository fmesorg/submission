				<h4>In a minority, but not alone</h4>
				<p>
					Dr Bawaskar, in his two pieces in the last two  issues of the journal, has briefly shared with us his principled, ethical  conduct in his clinical professional work <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bawaskar HS. Am I a bogus doctor? Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 138." id="7">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bawaskar HS. General practice in rural areas. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 14." id="8">2)</a>. I am writing this to say that  he is not alone. There is a small but significant section of doctors who have  been keeping away from the lures of drug companies and other medical companies,  and trying to do justice to their patients. What is needed is that such doctors  should keep in touch with each other, share their experiences, and act  together, whenever there is such a chance, to oppose unethical practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					One blatantly unethical practice is being promoted  currently by the NORMA company, which sells compression stockings for varicose  veins etc. A flier by this company offers doctors one Parker pen for every  'client' brought by the doctor to the company. This flier announces
				</p>
				<p>
					"Write a NORMA prescription worth Rs. 500/-  get a parker pen worth Rs. 50/- free. Send us the prescribed patient's order  form along with a D.D. of the appropriate amount."
				</p>
				<p>
					What can we do collectively to stop this practice?  The first step is to appeal doctors through various professional journals not  to be party to this 'trade-off'. Second, some of us can jointly write to the  concerned company that it should stop this unethical marketing. If we can get  some well-known doctors to sign this letter, it will have more impact.
				</p>
