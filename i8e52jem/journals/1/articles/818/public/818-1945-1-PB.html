					Ethical  practice requires that researchers should ensure the safety and welfare of  participants, and protection of their rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaccines  are considered the most cost-effective prevention tools for infectious diseases  such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) where behavioural change may  not always be successful. There are some advocates of a therapeutic vaccine <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thomas J. Unmet ethical concerns of the proposed preventive HIV vaccine trials in India. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;1:87-8." id="1">(1)</a>, but in view of the relative success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in  suppressing viral load and opportunistic infections, and in improving the  quality of life, it is difficult to imagine how therapeutic vaccines would work  better&mdash;though they might act as an adjunct to ART. Further, recognising the  limitations of secondary prevention, an ideal public health prevention strategy  should focus on primary prevention directed at a much larger vulnerable  population.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even  with increased financing for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, the AIDS  vaccine effort remains grossly inadequate <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Klausner RD, Fauci AS, Corey L et al. The need for a global vaccine enterprise. Science 2003;300:2036-9." id="2">(2)</a>. Nevertheless, there is a global  endeavour for the development of AIDS vaccines.
				</p>
				<p>
					AIDS is  a chronic, currently incurable and inevitably fatal disease that carries social  stigma. Ethical concerns in AIDS vaccine trials are related not only to the  nature of the virus, but also to the social stigma <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kirby M. HIV vaccine: ethics and human rights. Canadian HIV AIDS Policy Law Newsletter 2000;5:16-20." id="3">(3)</a>. They focus on the  physiological and psychosocial risks to trial participants, issues related to  informed consent, and complex trial design, access to treatment within a trial  and access to an effective vaccine afterwards <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Slack C, Lindegger G, Verdas E, Richter L, Strode A, Wassenaar D. Ethical issues in HIV vaccine trials in South Africa. South African Journal of Science 2000;96:291-5." id="4">(4)</a>. The research must have high  social value and scientific validity, and should be conducted fairly and with  appropriate independent review. People from the target population should be  included in decisions on the design and implementation of the trials <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mabunda G. Ethical issues in HIV research in poor countries. J Nurs Scholarsh 2001;33:111-14." id="5">(5)</a>.

				<h4>Undertaking  HIV vaccine trials in developing countries</h4>
				<p>
					The AIDS epidemic in some developing countries in Africa and Asia has led to an  eagerness to initiate AIDS vaccine trials. Trials may be initiated even with  economic constraints, sub-optimal infrastructure and technical capacities, low  levels of awareness among politicians and the community, inadequate experience  on protection of human rights and limited access to health care <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guenter D, Esparze J, Macklin R. Ethical considerations in international HIV vaccine trials; summary of a consultative process conducted by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS [UNAIDS]. J Med Ethics 2000;26:37-43." id="7">(7)</a>.  Policy-makers, programme managers, researchers and the community should decide  to initiate a vaccine trial only after carefully reviewing the level of  programmatic, scientific and community preparedness in the host country.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethical  review of research</h4>
				<p>
					There are international guidelines for ethical conduct of research and clinical  trials. Although international trials are sometimes reviewed by international  ethics committees (ECs), ethical review has to be done in the country hosting  the trial <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Center for Immunization Research, Johns Hopkins University. Note for guidance for good clinical practice&mdash;Selected ICH Guidelines and Declaration of Helsinky. 1995-2002. pp. 1-49." id="8">(8)</a>. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has published a  set of guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects that are on par  with other international guidelines <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Guidelines for bio-medical research on human subjects. New Delhi: ICMR, 2000." id="9">(9)</a> and will be applicable to Indian HIV  vaccine trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics  committees reviewing research must examine the safety and protection of  vulnerable human participants, value of the research, appropriateness of the  methods, balance of the risks and benefits, and arrangements for taking  voluntary, informed consent from participants. They must ensure that research  is not restricted to specific populations, is inclusive of future beneficiaries  and that local regulations are followed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  guidelines of the International Council of Harmonization on good clinical practice  in research recommend that the ECs should provide public assurance that  research participants are protected <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Center for Immunization Research, Johns Hopkins University. Note for guidance for good clinical practice&mdash;Selected ICH Guidelines and Declaration of Helsinky. 1995-2002. pp. 1-49." id="8">(8)</a>. Other international guidelines note  that local ECs must focus on questions such as whether the researcher is  suitably qualified, the research environment is appropriate, facilities are  available, and information is provided in the local language <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wainwright P, Saunders J. What are local issues? The problem of the local review of research. J Med Ethics 2004;30:313-17." id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The  process of informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					The ethical guidelines of the Council for International Organizations of  Medical Sciences (CIOMS) require that ethical standards governing human subject  research be no less stringent in developing nations than in developed nations <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects. Geneva: CIOMS, 2002." id="11">(11)</a>. This can be difficult if the levels of literacy are lower, understanding  about the nature and causation of diseases is sub-optimal, and personal  identity and individuality are not considered important <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rothman DJ. Clinical trials in developing countries: is there a special Third World ethic? Z Arztl Fortbild Qualitatssich 2003;97:695-702." id="12">(12</a>, <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Moodley K. HIV vaccine trial participation in South Africa&mdash;an ethical assessment. J Med Philos 2002;27:197-215." id="13">13)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  following information must be made clear to potential participants of a  clinical trial:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						They  are being asked to participate in a research study to test a vaccine against  HIV.
					</li>
					<li>
						They have the right to refuse to participate or withdraw at any time  without losing the benefit at the trial site.
					</li>
					<li>
						They will need to commit to a specified number of visits involving  certain procedures and collection of specimens.
					</li>
					<li>
						The vaccine being tested is of an experimental nature with no proven  safety and efficacy in humans.
					</li>
					<li>
						In a placebo-controlled trial, they may receive a placebo. In a blinded  trial, they will not be aware of what they receive
					</li>
					<li>
						They may experience some expected and/or unexpected side-effects of the  experimental vaccine.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Potential  participants should also be told about the kind of care that would be provided  to them during and after the trial, and steps that would be taken to maintain  confidentiality, with details of who would have access to trial-related data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Informed  consent of competent potential participants must be taken without fraud,  inducement or coercion. Investigators should document informed consent, which  may be subject to both external and internal monitoring, and audit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Researchers  must also confirm that trial participants have understood the information given  to them. In the case of AIDS vaccine trials, they must understand that the  vaccine is experimental and not yet proven to be protective, and hence they  must always practice safe behaviour. Comprehension tests can range from  multiple choice tests to essays and oral questionnaires. Community advisory  boards can advise on the appropriate method in a particular population.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Use  of placebo controls</h4>
				<p>
					There are generally no concerns about the use of placebos when testing  interventions for conditions that have no proven treatment or prevention  effect. There is an overall agreement that trial participants who received a  placebo in the clinical trial of a vaccine should be offered the vaccine once  it is licensed.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Inducement</h4>
				<p>
					It is universally accepted that subjects may be paid for the inconvenience  caused to them, the loss of wages and the time spent, and they should be  reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with their participation in  research. They may also receive free medical services. However, the payments  should not be so large or the medical services so extensive as to induce  prospective subjects to consent to participate in the research against their  better judgement and wishes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Standard  of care for trial participants and treatment of those who get infected with HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Though trial participants will be counselled to engage in safer sexual  practices, initial test vaccines are not likely to be 100% effective. There  will be a predictable and unavoidable incidence of HIV infection among vaccine  recipients. There will be infections among those in the control arm who  practise risk behaviour despite counselling. There are different views on  researchers' responsibility to provide treatment in such situations. These  range from providing the 'best proven treatment' to 'the prevailing standard of  care available in the host country'. Antiretroviral drugs are expensive, their  availability is limited, and need to be taken lifelong. Among the ethical  questions to be considered is: When the intervention being tested is a vaccine  and not therapy, are sponsors or investigators ethically obliged to provide  treatment? <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guenter D, Esparze J, Macklin R. Ethical considerations in international HIV vaccine trials; summary of a consultative process conducted by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS [UNAIDS]. J Med Ethics 2000;26:37-43." id="7">(7)</a> Requiring provision of the best treatment available globally can  undermine biomedical research aimed at improving global health <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brody F, Miller FG. The clinician-investigator: unavoidable but manageable tension. Kennedy Inst Ethics Journal 2003;13:329-46." id="14">(14</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Killen J, Grady C, Folkers GK, Fauci AS. Ethics of clinical research in the developing world. Nat Rev Immunol 2002;2:210-15." id="15">15)</a>. On the  other hand, in many developing countries, the prevailing standard of care can  be equivalent to no care at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					If  ethics demand that treatment be given to individuals infected with HIV in  vaccine trials, should vaccine trials be conducted in developing countries if  the cost of therapy is prohibitive? Will a decision to provide the best  available therapy constitute unreasonable inducement? If ART is initiated,  should the commitment be for the duration of the trial, for a specified time  after the termination of the trial, or for life? There are no definitive  answers. The CIOMS guidelines state that provision of services beyond those  necessary for research, including treatment of an infectious disease contracted  during the trial of a vaccine against that disease is not required but is  'morally praiseworthy' <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects. Geneva: CIOMS, 2002." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Provision  of insurance and ART for a stipulated period has been advocated by many <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fitzgerald DW, Pape JW, Wassenheit JN, Counts GW, Corel L. Provision of treatment in HIV-1 trials in developing countries. Lancet 2003;262:994." id="16">(16</a>, <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tucker T, Slack. Not if but how? Caring for HIV-1 vaccine trial participants in South Africa. Lancet 2003;262:995." id="17">17</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Berkley S. Thorny issues in the ethics of AIDS vaccine trials. Lancet 2003;362:992." id="18">18)</a>. Developing countries hosting a vaccine trial should have a clear  policy on these issues. They should negotiate the required arrangements with  the trial sponsors and share some responsibility as well. If researchers and  sponsors cannot make adequate commitment for treatment and care, this should be  clearly explained during the informed consent process.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Compensating  for injury</h4>
				<p>
					International ethical guidelines require that participants be compensated for  research-related injuries since they put themselves at risk in these trials.  Although there is often a provision for compensation for physical injuries,  non-physical injuries or 'social adverse events' such as loss of a job, housing,  income, insurance, medical care or reputation, often cannot be materially  compensated. Further, provisions for survivors in case of uncommon events such  as a participant's death (likely to be a rare event in a vaccine trial) need to  be delineated in the trial protocol. The CIOMS guidelines suggest that  financial or other assistance should compensate participants and the survivors  equitably for any temporary or permanent impairment or disability related to  the trial <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS). International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects. Geneva: CIOMS, 2002." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Potential  participants should be aware of the provision for compensation in case of  physical injury, and the circumstances in which they or their dependants would  (or would not) receive it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Post-trial  access to a vaccine</h4>
				<p>
					There is a general agreement that any vaccine, which is proved effective, must  be made available to the populations in the countries where the trials are  conducted at an affordable cost. However, two questions arise: How can  accessibility be ensured and how broadly can the product be made available?  Should access be limited to those at risk for acquiring the infection or be  extended to the general population? Even before initiating the trial, the  host countries should review their economic and political mechanisms, and their  infrastructural abilities to determine if they can ensure such access. Some  strategies to ensure availability of vaccines to populations that need them the  most are financial rewards to enable manufacture, technology transfer and  negotiation of intellectual property <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guenter D, Esparze J, Macklin R. Ethical considerations in international HIV vaccine trials; summary of a consultative process conducted by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/ AIDS [UNAIDS]. J Med Ethics 2000;26:37-43." id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conducting  HIV vaccine trials in India</h4>
				<p>
					Sustained advocacy at the socio-political level is needed to prioritise  resources for development and testing of HIV vaccine in India. The community  must be informed and involved for success of the trials. Acquiring truly  informed consent will require engagement of the communities in which the trial  has to be done <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Berkley S. Thorny issues in the ethics of AIDS vaccine trials. Lancet 2003;362:992." id="18">(18)</a>. The trial will be influenced by stigma, illiteracy and  gender norms. For example, members of our Community Advisory Board stressed  that involvement and concurrence of men would be needed for married women to  participate.
				</p>
				<p>
					While  India is on the verge of initiation of Phase I HIV vaccine trials, there will  always be questions about the ability of Indians to make informed decisions to  participate in vaccine trials, the use of vulnerable populations, quality of  the regulatory infrastructure, safety monitoring mechanisms and transparency <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="homas J. Unmet ethical concerns of the proposed preventive HIV vaccine trials in India. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;1:87-8." id="1">(1)</a>. It is important that the government, researchers, sponsors and the  community have a clear understanding of how various ethical issues related to  the HIV vaccine trial will be addressed in the upcoming trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  India, trials involving investigational products come under the purview of the  Office of the Drugs Controller General of India. The ICMR approves biomedical  research and also convenes a national EC for ethical review of all protocols of  national importance, and local institutional ethics committees also provide  their approval. These bodies should ensure that information sheets and consent  forms are appropriately designed with in-built mechanisms for the research team  to verify comprehension by the research subjects. The study materials should be  simple, adequately explanatory and informative. It is important to involve the  community from the beginning in the whole process. To ensure transparency, the  mass media should be closely involved. Community members and potential  volunteers need to be fully informed about the vaccine trial process, the use  of placebos, randomisation and blinding. This could be done through peer  educators <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="van Loon KV, Lindegger GC, Slack CM. Informed consent: A review of the experiences of South African clinical trial researchers. XIV International AIDS Conference, Barcelona, Spain, 2002." id="19">(19)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lengthy  documents, such as consent forms, requiring signatures might be viewed with  suspicion in India. Every consent form ends with a disclosure statement which  states that the purpose of the research, risks and benefits, information  related to procedures and rights of the participating individual have been  explained to the participant, that questions or doubts have been cleared and he  or she is willing to participate in the research study of his or her own free  will. This is followed by signatures of the participant and a witness. While  this signifies protection of individual autonomy, it also makes assumptions  about people's legal status, literacy and capacity to comprehend medical  information. In India, people often equate signatures with legal documents.  Therefore, it might be necessary to develop pictorial or audio-visual consents  to facilitate the informed consent process.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a  traditional society with overall low levels of awareness, trial participants  may be considered at 'high risk' of AIDS and thus face discrimination <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="UNAIDS. Guidance document on ethical considerations in HIV preventive vaccine research. June 2002." id="20">(20)</a>.  Researchers should ensure that participants of a vaccine trial are protected  from such harm by disseminating information and keeping in touch with the  community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants  of a vaccine trial will need sustained risk-reduction counselling, which is a  scientific and ethical requirement. Sensitive monitoring of trial participants'  behaviour would ensure adequacy of counselling procedures <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kippax S, Crawford J. Prophylactic vaccine trials: what is different about HIV? Venereology 1995;8:178-82." id="21">(21)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A major  challenge, if the vaccine proves effective, is to set up mechanisms to ensure a  sustained supply of the vaccine to the population. Fortunately, India has the  expertise, and the biotechnological and pharmaceutical infrastructure to make  this happen with the support of trial sponsors. Some Indian industries, with a  proven track record of vaccine manufacture, have been recently involved in  discussions to explore the possibility of their manufacturing the HIV vaccine,  if it proves to work.
				</p>

				<p>
					The government will have to take decisions on post-trial care and providing ART  to trial participants thoughtfully and with caution because decisions once made  need to be adhered to in future larger trials as well. Merely talking about  global access does not help. In spite of the major research achievement of ART,  these drugs are not easily accessible in resource-poor countries. In view of  the proposed Indian AIDS vaccine trials, this issue was discussed in a national  consultation involving public and private agencies. There was a consensus that  a corpus fund should be raised for the purpose and the sponsors, government and  society should make contributions. There was also a consensus on sponsors  supporting trial-related injuries and on exploring the possibility of providing  insurance to cover injuries occuring during the trial. The mechanism to decide  the causality of lasting injuries and to address disagreements through an  arbitration board has been defined in the context of the upcoming HIV vaccine  trial in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  necessary to establish a national HIV vaccine policy outlining a vaccine  development plan, an operational plan and an action plan to steer the country  from Phase I to Phase III of the clinical trials and beyond.
