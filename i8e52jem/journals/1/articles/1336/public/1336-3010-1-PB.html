				<h4>Why drugs cost so much...</h4>
				<p>
					Controversy surrounds  the price of prescription drugs in the US. In 1999, when drug industry profit  margins were higher than most other sectors of the US economy, drugs accounted  for 44% of the total increase in health care costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the post-development  costs of drug manufacture are only 20-30% of the sale price, the industry  justifies the rest on the basis of two factors. The first is that modern  pharmaceuticals, apart from providing therapies for conditions which were  previously untreatable, have reduced spending for hospital stays, surgery and  other costly treatments. The second factor is that the industry needs to recoup  the enormous overall cost of drug development where for one successful drug, the  industry screens 5,000 compounds in the lab and 10 are subjected to expensive  clinical trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					While there is some  truth in the first argument, in that drugs have reduced cardiovascular  mortality and lowered elective surgeries for diseases like peptic ulcer disease  and prostate hyperplasia, the cost of long-term drug therapy spread out over  many years is very high and therefore may not save much.  Cost-effectiveness analyses are being used in Australia, over the strenuous  objection of the industry, as a constraint on drug costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are the large costs  associated with drug development justified? Computer-assisted drug development  is expensive and has produced only a tiny number of drugs. Use of genomics in  drug development may be even more costly because the genetic component of most diseases  involves multiple rather than single genes which interact with environmental  factors to cause disease. Therefore genomics will need to tailor drugs to the  hundreds and thousands of multi-gene variants in individual patients resulting  in enormously expensive drugs applicable to a very small market.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead of government  price controls on drugs, or regulation by a non-profit institute set up by  private insurers and government, the industry could voluntarily lower prices.  The prime beneficiaries would be patients. Health care systems would be able to  spend the saved dollars on other badly needed basic medical services. Primary  payers such as government and employers would benefit from these reduced costs.  The pharmaceutical industry also would benefit. Its less-than-public spirited  image would improve and in addition it would reduce the threat of government  regulation which is a major concern to the industry.

				<h4>And the other point of view...</h4>
				<p>
					This article was  commissioned by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America as a  counterpoint to the above article.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pharmaceutical price  controls are being proposed to curtail increases in health care costs. However  the increase is caused more by an increased use of drugs and switching to  newer, more effective drugs than by an increase in price of existing drugs. The  industry's position is summarised below.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Pharmaceutical  research is motivated primarily by the possibility of large profits from the  rare success in research. Financial calculations suggest that after accounting  for risks and the role of research and development as an investment,  pharmaceutical industry profits have not persistently exceeded competitive  levels.
					</li>
					<li>
						Drug price controls  cannot rest on objective, predictable standards including the benefits or costs  of individual drugs, as medical and economic benefits cannot be determined  until well after marketing (depending on the size of treatable population,  changes in medical practice etc.). Research costs are shared among numerous  drugs and, sometimes, firms. Advertising costs, though considered wasteful by  some, make markets more competitive and are socially beneficial as advertising  overcomes information deficits of patients and doctors.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the absence of  objective standards for price control, price regulators would reduce drug  prices below levels sufficient to reward innovative research. Decisions would  be dominated by political forces and advocacy groups who would each try to pass  on the cost to other groups. Drugs already on the market would continue to be  available as long as prices remain above cost but a drug in development would  suffer as there would be no group advocating to price it above its cost which  would be unknown at that time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Research firms would  anticipate the effects of price controls and curtail research because potential  payoffs would be reduced. Firms undertaking the small probability, high payoff  research that is essential to pharmaceutical advances would have reasons to  doubt that they could obtain the financial returns necessary to recoup their  costs and sources of funding would dry up. The deleterious effect of price  control is evident in the slow progress on drugs for such massive problems as malaria  as the nations where malaria is a major problem are likely to exert price  control through disregarding patent rights to a breakthrough drug.
					</li>
					<li>
						Finally, once  established, price controls would tend towards complexity and  entrenchment of vested interests and could become permanent regardless of the  harms that they cause. In summary, pharmaceutical price controls offer  short-term gains for a small proportion of patients at the cost of curtailing  research that promises to bring far better therapies in the future.

				<h4>Participating in direct to consumer advertising</h4>
				<p>
					Direct-to-consumer  advertising (DCA) may be conducted through print media, television, audiotapes  and videotapes. DCA serves two purposes: it informs patients about a product  and it attempts to persuade them that one company's product is superior to that  of its competitors. Although DCA may be regarded as educational, it is also a  marketing tool. Pharmaceutical or medical device companies may solicit  neurologists to participate in DCA. This Practice Advisory is based on the  following tenets: 1) Patient education material produced by pharmaceutical or  medical device companies will provide education as well as advertising and  should therefore be regarded as DCA; 2) Mass marketing through DCA may promote  a drug or device that is unsuitable to an individual; 3) Participation in DCA  may harm a neurologist's professional reputation and trusted relationship with  patients; 4) The relationship between neurologists and industry merits further  analysis and improvement; 5) Public information about advances in therapy should  be conveyed from impartial sources. Neurologists may participate in DCA by  writing or editing material that is used as an insert in an article from the  sponsoring company, by authorising excerpts of their oral or written  presentations for video/audio tapes or pamphlets. Neurologists who participate  may be motivated by the belief that they are providing useful information to a  wide group of patients. However, the neurologist's contribution may be  distorted or her/his participation may be wrongly interpreted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Distortion could occur  if the neurologist's qualifying or cautionary statements are omitted from the  final product. Opinion could get presented as fact. A neurologist's preference  may make it harder for another neurologist to recommend an alternative medication.  Conflict of interest may occur if a neurologist has accepted compensation for  DCA. She/he may not be completely objective when assessing the relative merits  of competing products. Full disclosure to the public is the most common means  of mitigating a conflict of interest. Recommendations - A neurologist who  participates in DCA should insist on the following conditions:
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						She/he should have  the opportunity to review the finished product for accuracy and fairness and to  withdraw it if it cannot be modified to her/his satisfaction.
					</li>
					<li>
						The neurologist's  participation should be contingent upon the inclusion of a disclosure statement  similar to those used for scientific meetings and publications. It should  indicate the payment or other compensation received and should clearly state  conflict of interest, if any.
					</li>

				<h4>Reflections of a medical professional and editor</h4>
				<p>
					George D. Lundberg, a  distinguished pathologist and editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American  Medical Association for 17 years, knew that his sacking in 1999, as editor, was  inevitable. He had upset too many people for too long a time. His editorial strategy,  he has said, was 'to deliberately give (readers) something to complain about'.  This had eroded the patience of his corporate supervisors at the AMA. In the  end his editorship collapsed not on a point of principle or integrity but over  his decision to publish a study of students' attitudes about oral sex during  the public travails of President Bill Clinton. Lundberg is rueful about the  outcome: "The Monica Lewinsky affair resulted in the loss of my job,"  he writes, "but not Bill Clinton's."
				</p>
				<p>
					Lundberg begins with a  series of stinging indictments of the AMA. The present organization has 'lost  its credibility' and 'lacks leadership'. It has 'bloated senior staff', along  with 'a group of pampered voluntary officers' and executives enjoy 'inflated  per diems and multiple junkets'. According to Lundberg, the fact that over  two-thirds of physicians in the United States refuse to join its ranks proves  that the AMA is reviled by its constituency. He watched as the AMA adopted  staunchly pro-Republican policies, campaigned for the interest of the doctors  rather than patients, failed to protect the fragile mantle of professionalism  surrounding physicians and preferred to fight within its own committees rather  than openly on behalf of the public.
				</p>
				<p>
					He is equally scathing  about his clinical colleagues. There has been a 'disastrous severance of  trust', the origins of which lie in the ways in which doctors, their egos  inflated by the prospect of unbridled affluence, have sought new ways to make  money from the sick. As a result, professional standards have plummeted.  Medicine has been seduced by business. Lundberg wants doctors to take back  their profession and he believes they can do so only if they provide a package  of basic health care to all citizens. To achieve such an ambitious goal,  rationing must be embraced, not resisted. As unpleasant an idea as this might  seem, the benefits in tackling health inequalities and quality assurance, would  be overwhelming. On the whole, his account of a life and its times has the ring  of honesty. He also recognises that his expulsion from the AMA was to the  journal's eventual advantage. Stronger systems to safeguard editorial  independence are now in place for which his successor owes him a huge debt.
