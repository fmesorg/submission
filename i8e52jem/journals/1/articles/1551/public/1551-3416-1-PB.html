				<h4>Ethics and morals</h4>
				<p>
					Medical ethics is merely one branch of general ethics, therefore it would be  wrong to divorce ethics in medicine from the ethics of everyday life. Professor  Dunstan gives a succint but good definition of medical ethics- <em>"obligations of a moral nature which govern  the practice of medicine"</em> . It is important to dwell briefly on this definition to  understand the implications of <em>"obligations of a  moral nature"</em> and <em>"the practice of medicine",</em><em>"Moral"</em> and <em>"ethical"</em> are for practical purposes interchangeable  words. The term <em>"moral"</em> raises the .practical issues of good and evil,  of right and wrong, and of one's obligations as a physician to choose the good  or the right course. This is not always easy because one moral obligation may  conflict with another different but equally righteous moral obligation in a  given situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Morals have a basis either in religion,  philosophy or sociocultural traditions. Different concepts in religion,  philosophy or in socio-cultural traditions will lead to differing moral  principles. It can become increasingly difficult to establish an agreed ethical  code in a number of situations where there is a wide variation in the moral  base. Even so, the absolute values of good and evil, right and wrong, and the  belief in the sanctity of human life, are remarkably similar in all societies.

				<h4>Medicine- a search  for truth</h4>
				<p>
					Thus, the three basic, accepted, moral obligations in a doctor-patient  relationship in all societies are, beneficence (and its companion-in-arms,  non-malficence), patient autonomy and justice. It is the judicious balance  between these obligations that determines ethical decisions in a given clinical  situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The practice of medicine, in a very broad  philosophical sense, is a search for truth, and ethical and moral principles  are in-built and inseparable within this search. In a more pragmatic sense,  the practice of medicine is both an art and a science. The aspect of science in  medicine is more easily understood. For example, it may constitute accurate,  measurable observations that lead to a hypothesis, the truth of which is  subsequently validated by relevant observations. The art in medicine is an  immeasurable, indefinable quantum. It indeed approaches the realm of philosophy  which according to Bertrand Russell is the art of rational conjecture . It is  no surprise that physicians have been some of the best philosophers through the  ages, and have_ translated abstract theories of classic philosophy into  practical philosophic or ethical action at bedside.

				<h4>Medical education and  practice</h4>
				<p>
					The practice of medicine requires education, knowledge, and wisdom born of  experience. It has to be taught and its path illuminated, so that the student  who aspires to this practice is shown the way. It is the moral obligation and  ethical responsibility of a civilization or a society to ensure that this is  done. The need to equip a physician with the right attributes and to inculcate  a breadth of vision that transcends the mere acquisition of knowledge, is even  more imperative in a fast changing, increasingly technologyoriented world. If  this is neglected, the physician of today and tomorrow may do more harm than  good and may well be a hazard to those he ministers. It is unfortunate that  this basic objective in medical education seems to be increasingly ignored in  our country.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical education all over the world involves  selection for admission into medical schools, undergraduate study, postgraduate  study and qualification, specialist training and research. I shall briefly  consider the problems that plague each aspect of medical education in our  country.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Admission to medical  school</h4>
				<p>
					Entry into medical schools necessitates a selection from a large number of  applicants. Universally this is attempted through results of a pre-medical  examination in basic sciences relevant to medicine, and a personal interview of  aspiring candidates. It is the height of absurdity that the average level of  marks required for admission to medical school at the premedical entrance exam  in Mumbai is over 95%. One would have expected brilliance of an extraordinary  character (amounting to genius) from these students.
				</p>
				<p>
					Far from it, the standard at most is average  and often pathetic.. The fault obviously is with the premedical education and  the premedical exam. Surely a system of examination can be devised where the  exceptional few would get more than 70%, the very bright around 60% and the  average pass marks are around 50%. A system of .examination (as it exists  today) where the difference of half or one mark decides admission into medical  school, and where so many entrants to medical schools in Mumbai, mediocre  though they may be, score near about lOO%, is not .only absurd, but morally and  ethically unjustifiable. It needs drastic change and with a little effort this  is possible. The system of examination again should not only be different, but  should be patently fair. It should be so organized and conducted that  allegations or leakage of papers and unfair marking practices are laid to rest  once and for all.
				</p>

				<h4>Undergraduate medical  education costs</h4>
				<p>
					Medical education as I see it today, is confused in method, content and  purpose. The old disciplines in medicine continue to expand taking up time and  attention, only to be challenged by claims of newer disciplines which have  opened fresh vistas of knowledge. Good teaching involves a balance between what  is old and trusted and what is new and changing. Medicine knows no frontiers.  Even so, the main thrust of undergraduate medical education in our medical  schools should affecting the immediate be oriented to the health problems and  the people of our community country. Yet the current trend is to lay greater  stress on problems afflicting the West, and a passing or poor reference to  diseases that ravage our communities. It is of ethical importance to teach  medical students various aspects of community medicine, as only then are they  aware of practical health problems that beset the people of this impoveris hed  country. This of course does not mean that we should turn a blind eye to what  goes on in medicine in the rest of the world. It only means that we structure  our priorities in teaching and in health care correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The method of teaching in our colleges leaves  views, much to current methods and desired. It is dull, dry, didactic and  tabulated. techniques, and often does not utilize the more recent modes It  takes of imparting education as for example the use of slides,novideo  recordings, student seminars, project work, clinico-pathological conferences,  the use and study of key references that illuminate a subject or that excite  interest and curiosity. Good teaching though concentrating on essentials must  question dogma, must arouse and encourage an attitude of inquiry, a thirst for  knowledge, and serve as stimulus for further study. Above all, a good teacher  should use the patient as the chief source of education. The patient is the  centre or the fulcrum on which medical education rests. It is wrong for a  teacher to ignore this basic. tenet.Ward rounds should be rounds where the  patient speaks and instructs directly or indirectly, and the medical teacher  with consummate art serves as the medium through which the patient instructs.
				</p>
				<p>
					All teaching whenever possible should be  imbued with an ethical slant. Ethics in medicine need not be taught in didactic  lectures, but should be illustrated at every opportunity at the patient's  bedside. Ethical principles are imbibed by example and precept, so that a good  teacher besides teaching well will have a tremendous moral influence on his  students.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is thus both the form and content of  teaching that needs to be revamped in all our medical schools. It is the moral  and ethical obligation of the medical school that teachers discharge this  responsibility to the best of their ability. The sadness of medical education, to  my mind, is the paucity of good teachers and good teaching in our colleges.  This is ethically indefensible and is the fount of numerous unhealthy trends  that beset the medical profession.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Costs</h4>
				<p>
					Medical teaching  should always be the prerogative medical schools and teaching hospitals. It is  morally wrong to allow or to encourage medical teaching at a fantastic cost and  price through tuitions or coaching classes outside teaching hospitals. What is  even more ethically insufferable is the allegation that some of these expensive  coaching are run by teachers currently employed i n medical classes schools. It  is one of the tenets of the Hippocratic oath that teacher will teach his  students what he knows as a duty and not for a fee.
				</p>
				<p>
					The practice of coaching classes that claim to  assure a successful exam result, and also perhaps ensure marks high enough to  get good teaching resident posts, is not only unethical in principle, but is  also fraught with numerous other unethical possibilities. . There is always a  probability, or at least a possibility, of a nexus between the coaching grades,  distinctions and prizes at the university examinations. The tentacles of  corruption and nepotism can further undermine a system that already leaves much  to be desired. The standard of doctors would further fall,medicine as practiced  by these doctors would inevitably be even more oriented towards mere profit,  and the profession would degenerate into a mercenary business where patient  care may become secondary or even non-existent.
				</p>
				<p>
					But then we must pause and ask ourselves-  could these unethical eyesores (termed coaching classes) ever have come into  existence in our city if teaching in our medical school was interesting,  stimulating, instructive and comprehensive? Indifferent teachers and poor  teaching in medical schools is ethically .wrong, and is undoubtedly a factor  responsible for the spawning of private coaching classes. This again  illustrates a principle in medical ethics one wrong often begets another and  another, so that we end up with a chain of wrongs.

				<h4>Private medical  colleges</h4>
				<p>
					Over the last two decades there has been a mushrooming of private medical  colleges in our country, charging capitation fees of several lacs of rupees.  Should such colleges be permitted and even encouraged, or are these colleges  unethical eyesores that make a mockery of medicine?
				</p>
				<p>
					Private medical schools funded by trusts,  foundations or even by individuals are not uncommon in other countries  particularly in the United States. On principle there is nothing unethical in  privately funded medical education, provided the following criteria are met:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						The raison d'etre is altruistic and  divorced from all profit motives.
					</li>
					<li>
						The college has the necessary infrastructure for good teaching, and has a  hospital with sufficient number of beds to permit clinical study in all  important disciplines of medicine.
					</li>
					<li>
						The college is well equipped and has qualified teachers in basic sciences and  in clinical subjects with an acceptable student-teacher ratio. "
					</li>
					<li>
						The funding and all sources of finance are transparently honest, and the fees  charged are solely directed towards maintaining and improving medical education  and facilities.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is accountability in the medical school's administration, and in all  its other functions.
					</li>
					<li>
						The standard is on par with all other schools in the country. There are very  few schools that meet these standards. If, as is alleged, business ventures  come in the guise of private medical schools, the standard of medicine would be  deplorably poor and the practice of medicine an unmitigated disaster.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Examinations</h4>
				<p>
					There is even today a  great deal of mistrust over the fairness of both undergraduate and postgraduate  examinations. We read of favouritism, nepotism and even corruption. The degree  of canker afflicting the honesty and propriety of examination results is  impossible for an outsider to determine, but again it is the moral obligation  of the universities to ensure that exams are fair and impartial, on par with  those conducted in teaching centres all'over the world.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Postgraduate education</h4>
				<p>
					If undergraduate education in the doldrums, post graduate education is bound to  suffer. Unfortunately, the majority of graduates if they could, would elect to do  their postgraduate studies and specialize. Freedom of choice needs to be  'tempered by ability, aptitude and resources. Ethically speaking it is  preferable to have fewer but well trained postgraduates and specialists, rather  than have a veritable army of postgraduates and specialists whose training by  international standards leaves much to be desired. It is our ethical  responsibility to ensure this is so. An inadequately trained specialist is an  even greater danger to health than the poorly taught and trained general  practitioner or community doctor. Such a specialist often practices in an  uncritical workshop of technocracy, pays homage to and feeds the machine which  benefits him, looks at his patients in specialist frenzy but with blinkers, and  loses the all important holistic approach to medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is ethically imperative that all invasive  procedures, diagnostic or therapeutic, in specialist medicine should be taught  and then supervised by peers in their respective fields. It is imperative, as  in most countries in the world that to independently qualify to do a  potentially dangerous invasive procedure, a specialist needs to do and thereby  practice, a minimum acceptable number over a period of a year, and then  continue to do so. This is sadly lacking in some specialties today and  unquestionably contributes to iatrogenic morbidity and mortality.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>
					The last, yet, an  important aspect of medical education is research. There are undoubtedly some  who are born to research rather than patient care. Research again should be on  subjects of topical interest. There is indeed great scope for clinical research  in our country because of the wealth of clinical material we possess. There is  also an equally tremendous scope for epidemiological research- an aspect of disease  that is shrouded in ignorance. Is it morally justified to allocate sparse funds  for research on some aspect of disease which has already been researched upon a  hundred times over? This has more often than not become the rule rather than  the exception in our country. It is important for concerned authorities to  realize that one good research publication is superior to a hundred research  papers which repeat what has been said many times over. Integrity in research  has deteriorated the world over; the motto "publish or perish" is the sword of  Damocles hanging over the researcher's head. He compromises on scientific  standards, on truth, on honesty, and often also on his ethical approach to  methods employed to further his research.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, ethics should relate not only to  the practice of medicine but to all facets of medical education. Only then will  the practice of medicine flower and flourish as it should. That "there is  something rotten in the kingdom of Denmark" is obvious in relation both to the  practice of medicine and to medical education. I shall not dissect the cause of  this canker except to state that this is due to a sharp, progressive fall of  values all over the world, more so in our country. When one loses one's sense  of values, when the value system is corrupt, the edifice this system supports  and embellishes, crumbles and disintegrates. One cannot expect the profession  of medicine in all its varied aspects to remain a bastion of virtue and probity  when it is surrounded by a sea of filth and corruption. The bastion slowly and  surely is bound to be eroded and may well be submerged beneath this sea.

				<em>The significance of  the intimate personal.
					 relationship between physician and patient cannot be too  strongly emphasised, for in an extraordinarily large number of cases both the  diagnosis and treatment are directly dependent on it. One of the essential  qualities of the clinician is interest in humanity, for the secret of the care  of the patient is in caring for the patient.</em>
