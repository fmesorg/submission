				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Studies have shown that the decision to participate or not
					participate in a clinical trial does not necessarily imply that the
					volunteers have completely understood the clinical trial process.
					A study carried out among medical and non-medical student
					volunteers revealed that even though the former group had a
					better recollection of the key facts, their understanding was still
					below expectation. In our study, medical students were invited
					to voluntarily take part in a hypothetical exercise in which they
					were presented with an informed consent form to indicate their
					willingness to participate in an anti-malarial drug trial. They
					were encouraged to clarify their doubts and asked to answer a
					questionnaire to determine their willingness/unwillingness. They
					were asked to state their reasons and recall key information given
					in the informed consent form. Responses were submitted by 155
					students and 51% of the respondents consented to participate
					in the trial. As many as 13.5% did not know the name of the drug
					under study, 14.8% could not recall the main adverse effects to be
					expected, and 12.3% did not know that they could opt out of the
					study, this being significantly more in those who had consented to
					participate (p0.0. As is evident from our study, even presenting
					a detailed consent form containing an explanation might leave
					a considerably large number of potential volunteers with an
					incomplete understanding of the study. Therefore, it is necessary
					to make an active effort to ensure that the counselling of the
					volunteers is based on their ability to comprehend the information
					provided.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Informed consent is a decision to participate in research, taken
					by a competent individual who has received the necessary
					information; who has adequately understood the information;
					and who, after considering the information, has arrived at a
					decision without having been subjected to coercion, undue
					influence or inducement, or intimidation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects [Internet]. Geneva: 2002 [cited 2013 Nov 18]. Available from: http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. The consent
					document is not only central to the volunteer's understanding
					of the study in which he/she is going to participate, but also
					an important component of evidence of the volunteer having
					been recruited into the study after being fully apprised of the
					risks and benefits of participation. An ideal informed consent
					session should be interactive, rather than a matter of the
					participant just reading and signing the document. While the
					comprehensibility of the informed consent document has
					rightly been the focus of many studies as well as regulatory
					guidelines, meagre attention has been paid to the personnel
					providing the information on the study process. Studies have
					shown that the decision to participate or not participate in a clinical trial does not necessarily imply that the volunteers have
					completely understood the clinical trial process (<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="DeCosta A, D'Souza N, Krishnan S, Chhabra MS, Shihaam I, Goswami K.

					The aim of this study was to determine the understanding of
					the information contained in an informed consent document
					among second-year medical students who were about to
					complete the pharmacology course. Medical students were
					considered the subjects for this study as they were fully
					qualified in terms of general and subject-specific knowledge,
					as well as the ability to easily remember the clinical facts
					presented to them. This would make them ideal subjects as
					far as understanding information in informed consent forms is
					concerned.

				<h4>Method</h4>
				<p>
					Fifth-semester students who were about to complete their
					pharmacology course from a medical college in southern India
					were invited to voluntarily take part in a hypothetical exercise
					in which they were presented with an informed consent form to
					indicate their willingness to participate in an anti-malarial drug
					trial. The informed consent form was developed on the basis
					of the World Health Organization informed consent templates
					and the instructions contained therein were adhered to
					wherever applicable <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Informed consent for clinical studies [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2013 [cited 2013 Nov 18]. Available from: http://www.who.int/rpc/research_ethics/informed_consent/en/" id="6">(6)</a>. Approval from the institutional ethics
					committee was obtained prior to the initiation of the study. The
					information in the consent document was presented to the
					students in a group with the help of a PowerPoint presentation.
					The information was read out verbally during the presentation.
					Key information, such as the objectives of the study, the
					intervention, and the risks and benefits, were repeated to
					ensure proper comprehension of the information. The students
					were encouraged to ask questions for further clarification
					regarding the trial process. They were then asked to answer a
					questionnaire to determine their willingness/unwillingness to
					participate in the trial. They were asked to state their reasons
					and recall key information provided in the informed consent
					form. The demographic data collected included the students'
					age and gender, as well as the annual income of the parents.

					The specific questions asked with regard to the information
					in the informed consent form are mentioned in Table 2. The
					influence of gender and the parents' income on the willingness
					to participate in the clinical trial was also determined.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4> Statistical analysis</h4>
				<p>
					The difference between the groups was determined by
					using the chi-square test. A p-value of 0.0 was considered
					statistically significant.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					Of the 208 students invited to participate in the exercise, 155
					participated and submitted their responses. Nine students
					did not answer any of the questions, except those on the
					demographic data and their willingness to participate. Hence,
					their response was not considered when evaluating the
					understanding and recall of key information. Of the total
					respondents, 58.1% were female. Fifty-one per cent of the
					respondents expressed a willingness to participate in the drug
					trial. The economic status of the students did not significantly
					affect their willingness to participate in the trial. The effect
					of gender and the economic status of the parents on the
					willingness to participate is shown in Table 1.
				</p>
				<p>

					The students' comprehension and recall of the information
					pertaining to the study is presented in Table 2. No significant
					gender difference was seen in the responses. However, the
					number of respondents who consented to participate in the
					study formed a significantly large proportion of those who did
					not know that they could withdraw any time without providing
					any reason (p&lt;0.05).
				</p>
				<p>
					The most common reasons provided by the medical students
					for participation/non-participation in the drug trial are given in
					Table 3.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Of the 155 students who took part in the exercise, 51% were
					willing to participate in the drug trial. Altruistic motives
					were the most commonly cited reason for the willingness to participate, while uncertainty regarding the risks involved
					was the main reason for not participating. These reasons are
					comparable to those reported by volunteers participating in
					clinical studies. As this was a hypothetical exercise involving
					medical students, the willingness to participate in a clinical
					study due to a possible personal health benefit was justifiably
					not the common reason (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shah JY, Phadtare A, Rajgor D, Vaghasia M, Pradhan S, Zelko H, Pietrobon R.

					financial benefit did not appear to be a significant factor. As
					many as 12%-16% of the students did not answer one or more
					of the questions correctly. More importantly, 14.8% could not
					recall any of the main adverse effects, while 12.4% did not
					know they were free to opt out. The lack of understanding
					of the freedom to opt out of a study has been observed in
					other similar studies <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B, Raveendran R, Pandian DG, Sujindra S.

Incomplete comprehension of each
					point of the information in Table 2 might lead to incomplete
					participation (an incomplete understanding of the duration
					of the study and the number of visits), a loss of faith in the
					healthcare providers, and a feeling of injustice (in the case of adverse effects). It may also result in participation due to fear.
					The gender or economic background of the students did not
					make any significant difference.

					A study carried out to test the recall, following surgery, of the
					information provided in informed consent forms among Indian
					patients showed that approximately two-thirds of both males
					and females were able to recollect the details, there being hardly
					any difference between the genders <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sanwal AK, Kumar S, Sahni P, Nundy S. Informed consent in Indian patients. J R Soc Med. 1996 April;89(4):196-8." id="10">(10)</a>. Older and poorer
					patients found it more difficult to recall the facts explained
					to them before surgery. Comprehension of the information
					seemed to improve with increasing education. Depending on
					the social and cultural setting, female patients may not readily
					give their consent to participation in a trial as they may not be
					in a position to take independent decisions <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B, Raveendran R, Pandian DG, Sujindra S.

					Health literacy has a significant bearing on the level of
					comprehension of information provided to volunteers. National
					assessment of adult literacy data indicates that only 12% of
					the adult population in the USA has proficiency in health
					literacy skills <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kutner M, Greenberg E, Jin Y, Paulsen C.

Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education; 2006." id="11">(11)</a>. While the consent forms are designed to be
					understood by a lay person, most health professionals are not
					aware of their patients' low levels of health literacy or the fact
					that most patients are too embarrassed to let their healthcare
					providers know that they have not really understood their
					instructions <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kickbusch IS. Health literacy: addressing the health and education divide. Health Promot Int. 2001 Sep;16(3):289-97." id="12">(12)</a>. Several methods have been studied to
					improve patient volunteers' understanding of the information
					presented in consent forms. While the use of multimedia,
					enhanced consent forms, questionnaires and feedback can play
					a role in improving comprehension, it is probably the role of the
					investigator or the trained personnel providing the information
					that needs more attention <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Flory J, Emmanuel E. Interventions to improve research participants' understanding in informed consent for research: a systematic review. JAMA. 2004 Oct 6;292(13):1593-601." id="13">(13)</a>. A meaningful discussion with
					a trained person, who can gauge the degree of the volunteer's
					comprehension of the information and address the deficient
					areas appropriately, is important.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study has certain drawbacks. The response of the medical
					students was obtained as a part of a hypothetical exercise.
					Being aware of the hypothetical nature of the exercise, the
					students might not have been as attentive and involved as they
					would have been in a real scenario. This might have affected
					their response.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<p>
					While proper care might be taken to obtain the informed
					consent of the participants in a trial, they might not be fully
					aware of all the important information presented to them. This hypothetical exercise, conducted among well-educated medical
					students with a knowledge of pharmacology, highlights
					this issue. Presenting a consent form with an explanation
					of the details might still leave a considerably large number
					of potential volunteers with an incomplete understanding
					of the study they would participate in. Therefore, an active
					effort is necessary to enhance the level of the volunteers'
					comprehension, which can be achieved by counselling them
					on the basis of their ability to understand the information
					provided.
