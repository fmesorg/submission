					The  successful completion of the human genome sequence can be counted as one of the  most important scientific achievements in biology in recent times. The analysis  of the draft sequence by two groups, the human genome consortium and a private  company <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Genome International Sequencing Consortium : Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome. Nature 2001; 409: 860-921." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Venter JC et al; The sequence of the human genome. Science 2001; 291:1304-1350." id="2">2)</a>, has revealed astonishing insights into the genetic blueprint of  the human race. It has also provided tantalising clues as to what makes us a  unique species.
				</p>
				<p>
					To cite a  few examples, the analysis of the draft human genome sequence has revealed that  (a) humans have a total of only about 31,000-39,000 genes which is only  fractionally higher than the 18,000 genes of Caenorhabditis elegans &mdash; a worm &mdash;  and 26,000 genes in Arabidopsis- a plant (compare these with 6,000 genes in  yeast and 13,000 in Drosophila - a fly). (b) Less than 1.1-1.4% of the 3.2  billion basepairs codes for a functional gene products while the rest 98% are  mostly repetitive DNA with an as yet unidentified function. (c) About 50 % of  the genome consists of the four classes of repetitive DNA segments, many of  them interspersed as large islands throughout the genome. (d) There are vast  stretches of DNA deserts devoid of any genes at all on certain chromosomes,  while there are dense gene clusters on others. (e) More than 1.42 million  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP, these indicate the degree of variability  of an allele in a population) have been identified in the draft version of the  genome with many more likely to be identified in the near future. These  polymorphisms are likely to be the hotspots of genetic variations and the  probable cause of various genetic pathologies and hence are likely to be the  first search targets by medical researchers.

					Much of  this knowledge was unheard of even a year ago. New, mind-boggling facts are  being unravelled about our genetic make-up almost every day. New results and  hypotheses on human genetics are being proposed, tested and in some cases  disproved <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Michael J. Stanhope MJ, Lupas A, Italia MJ, Koretke KK, Volker C &amp; Brown JR.: Phylogenetic analyses do not support horizontal gene transfers from bacteria to vertebrates. Nature 2001; 411; 940-944" id="3">(3)</a>. New technologies are demonstrating their potential to unravel  useful medical information from the genetic data. The first glance at the raw  sequence data has yielded important insights on phenomena like addiction <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nestler EJ, Landsman D: Learning about addiction from the genome. Nature 2001; 409:834-835" id="4">(4)</a>.  Numerous key protein targets have been identified for targeting by  immunomodulatory treatments <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fahrer AM, Bazan JF, Papathanasiou P, Nelms KA, Goodnow CC: A genomic view of immunology. Nature 2001; 409: 836-838." id="5">(5)</a> and more than 10,000 of disease causing genes  in humans and their causal mutation have been catalogued <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="McKusick, V.A.: Mendelian Inheritance in Man.

					It is  clear that even by conservative estimates, the impact of this research on any  field of human biology &mdash; especially medicine &mdash; is likely to be staggering.  While there may be little in terms of immediate benefit to the general medical  practitioner (especially in India), there is much cause for optimism as the  genome sequence is likely to provide a fertile hunting ground for medical  researchers to probe the molecular underpinnings of many diseases. This is  evident from the unprecedented increase (in the developed world) in investment  of manpower and financial resources in both academia and commercial ventures in  research projects that exploit the new information. Many suspected cases of  rare medical anomalies go unnoticed during routine investigations in Indian  hospitals. Cheap and rapid screening methods that are likely to emerge in the  near future could enable the 'doctor on the street' to quickly screen the  average patient with little investment in cost and manpower.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is  however a darker side to this story. Led by the prospects of untold riches and  the urge to gain biotechnological leadership, there has been a scramble among  commercial ventures to patent DNA sequences which are suspected to be involved  in critical disease processes and thus have potential commercial value. The  rapidity with which this field has advanced has given little time for  legislatures to formulate laws on complex genome related legal and ethical  issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Indian contribution to the genome endeavour has been dismal from the beginning,  almost non-existent. Like in most cases, Indian science has adopted the  wait-and-see approach even as the genomic gold mine lies bare in front of us  with all its prospects. Today India with its diverse population base  distributed over a vast geographical area is uniquely placed to gain from these  evolving technologies. The multicultural and multiracial nature of our society  has a rich and diverse genetic resource inherently embedded in it.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of  the main reasons for the success of this project was the tremendous advancement  made in various technologies like automated sequencing methods, increase in  computational power and advanced algorithms for sequence assembly and annotation.  Many of these techniques were unthinkable even five to six years ago. It is  clear that if India is to benefit from these technologies and realise the full  potential of its vast genetic resources, there must be a paradigm shift in the  manner in which basic and applied research is practised, be it in isolated labs  or large collaborative studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Biomedical  and genomic technologies existing today can tinker with the genetic makeup of  reproductive cells. This can have profound consequences on and affect lives of  millions of people at a fundamental level. Will this knowledge be used to  benefit us in hitherto unforeseen ways? Or will it unleash new ghosts from the  Pandora's box? These are questions for the future. Nonetheless, it is clear  that new ethical and moral questions are likely to be hotly debated in  scientific circles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need  of the hour is to create awareness, among biomedical research personnel and  practitioners, of the new opportunities &mdash; and the dangers - in emerging  technologies. There should be a concerted effort among the academic scientific  community and medical practitioners to rapidly (albeit cautiously) apply the  new technologies to problems of immediate national concern. This has to be  correlated by an appropriate increase in funds available for projects which  focus on the use of these methodologies for problems relevant in the Indian  context. The decision of the department of biotechnology, to fund areas in  stem-cell research on cataract and the brain is a step in the right direction.  The impressive strides made by indigenous academic research centres and  commercial laboratories in stem cell research are indeed commendable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regulatory  bodies which monitor the ethical practices of medical personnel, and those  monitoring the preservation of indigenous genetic material, will have  additional responsibilities. They must set up ethical and regulatory standards  on experimental protocols so that the interests of subjects are safeguarded.  Ethical and responsible conduct is going to be increasingly necessary in light  of the power of the emerging technologies <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Editorial: Defining a new bioethic. Nature Genetics 2001; 297-298." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This will  go a long way in restricting the 'drain' of the nation's valuable genetic  resources while exploiting the full potential of local resources, with which  India is richly endowed.
