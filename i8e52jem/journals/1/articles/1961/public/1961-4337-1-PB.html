				<h4>Cross practice</h4>
				<p>
					The editorial <em>Cross  practice at the cross roads (Issues in Medical Ethics</em> 1996; 4: 103-104) aptly  represents the landmark judgement of the Supreme Court against non-allopathic  doctors practising allopathic medicine and vice versa. It also clearly states  that such practices violate, per se, the Indian Medical Council Act, constitute  medical negligence and attract fines or imprisonment.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a disgrace for the Medical Council of  India that such a judgement became necessary. Does this august body know that  in Mumbai nursing homes and private hospitals are under the care of non  allopathic resident medical doctors employed by allopathic owners? These non-allopathic resident doctors not only manage general wards but also critical  areas such as intensive care units and intensive cardiac care units. They not  only attempt to interpret traces on cardiac monitors but also proceed to treat  them and even administer DC shocks on their own judgement. The specialists who  run such intensivecare units depend heavily on the findings conveyed by such  doctors over the telephone and proceed to recommend changes in therapy on the  basis of this information.
				</p>
				<p>
					A recently announced Heart Brigade attached to  a private nursing home sends out a non-allopathic doctor to the patient's home  when it receives emergency calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are those employing such non-allopathic  doctors not liable for medical negligence?
