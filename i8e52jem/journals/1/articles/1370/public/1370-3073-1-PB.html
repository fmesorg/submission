					As a counsellor for  families of psychiatric patients, I have come across many instances of  questionable behaviour among psychiatrists. While it may be difficult to  describe them outright unethical, they seem to prevent people from getting  effective psychiatric help, and increase the burden carried by patients and  their families.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surekha was the only earning member of an educated Indian middle-class family.  When she lost her father in her final year of college, she was forced to look  for a job in order to shoulder family responsibilities. Luckily for her, it was  not difficult to find a job in a private company in Delhi, though her lack of  experience meant she had to be content with a low salary.
				</p>
				<p>
					The family consisted of  three sisters (of which Surekha was the oldest), an elder brother, and an  ageing mother. The brother suffered from schizophrenia, a devastating illness  that affects one per cent of the population. In this condition both patient and  family face several traumatic situations. The illness triggers off  uncontrollable symptoms, in the patient, such as fragmented thoughts accompanied  by hallucinations, anxieties and, very often, violence. Without an  understanding of the nature of this illness, the family is unable to handle  such behaviour and help the person get better. The majority of patients  suffering from schizophrenia can function normally if the problem is detected  early, and they are given adequate treatment and counselling along with  psychotropic medication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like Surekha, there are hundreds of young men and  women who are facing the challenge of handling a family member suffering from  schizophrenia. In the beginning the families try to deal with the situation  within the family environment but when there are frequent bouts of violence  they must seek psychiatric help.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus begins their ordeal of dealing with endless trips to psychiatrists. Many  private practitioners do not reveal facts to the patients as they feel they may  lose their regular income and hence keep giving false assurances like "there is  no problem", "continue the same medication", "do yoga", "come next week", etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, people are unsatisfied with the treatment and go from one doctor  to another, seeking treatments from various doctors and in various hospitals.  People who could have been treated successfully if the problem had been  identified early end up chronically mentally ill. Some are abandoned in asylums  by their families.
				</p>
				<p>
					Schizophrenia does not have a definite cure; it can only be contained and  requires specialised care and treatment in hospital. Thereafter, when the  patient is stabilised he or she requires constant medication along with  counselling and some kind of vocational training which cannot be done in a  family situation. They need to be handled in a halfway home where everything is  provided in a balanced manner. Such sustained, specialised care is available in  very few halfway homes. Those that offer such services are not affordable for  middle-class families like that of Surekha.
				</p>
				<p>
					For Surekha, the challenge of looking after an affected elder brother, two  younger sisters and an ageing mother was very traumatic. She walked into my  home one evening to ask for help with her brother who was showing acute  symptoms of schizophrenia. He had stopped going out of the house, had become  highly abusive, and displayed demanding and violent behaviour. She looked  harassed and wept bitterly, telling me she saw no charm in living and wanted to  commit suicide.
				</p>
				<p>
					I advised her not to take that extreme step. I told her that years earlier I  too had been in a similar situation, Today, I said, I was there to help her  out, as a counsellor for families with such problems. I suggested that she talk  to a psychiatrist and get her brother sedated in order to admit him to a  hospital. Unfortunately in Delhi only private hospitals have facilities for  dealing with emergencies like sending an ambulance with wardens to handle  psychotic patients. A reference from a psychiatrist simplifies matters.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next day, I explained the case to a reputed psychiatrist. I requested him  not to charge Surekha since she was only seeking guidance on how to admit her  brother to the hospital, and the people she could approach for this work. On  enquiring from Surekha later, I found out that the psychiatrist had charged her  Rs. 450 &mdash; just to tell her to contact the concerned hospital for calling an ambulance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, I understand if the patient had been taken to the doctor for treatment and  the doctor had prescribed medicines after an assessment. But should a doctor  charge a fee just to give simple advice?
				</p>
				<p>
					A few weeks later, Surekha met me again. Her brother had been admitted in a  prestigious but expensive hospital in Delhi. She was finding it hard to bear  the costs of treatment here. I suggested that she send her brother for further  treatment and rehabilitation to the National Institute of Mental Health and  Science (NIMHANS) at Bangalore. It would be more affordable in the long run.  However, when she asked the doctors to discharge her brother so she could take  him to Bangalore, they told her that NIMHANS was a mental asylum and her  brother would be mistreated there. Now, NIMHANS is a premier organisation for  mental health in India. Were the doctors behaving responsibly by creating such  fears in the minds of this family about such a well-known organisation? Could  they offer Surekha better options?
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead of helping Surekha make a choice that would help her brother while  preventing her from going bankrupt, the doctors had created new fears and made  her situation even more difficult. Was this ethical behaviour?
