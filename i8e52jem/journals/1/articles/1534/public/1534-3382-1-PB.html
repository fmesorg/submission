					The sociologist's view of medicine as a practising profession and as a societal  institution is eclectic and still not fully developed. The range of issues  subjected to their inquiry depend on the social and cultural milieu of the  community under consideration. Advances in bio-medical technology, with rapid  growth in complexity and consequently increase in the costs of diagnostic and  therapeutic medical care, are important considerations in a developing country  like India. It is a different matter that cost containment is now relevant even  in rich countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Government policy for the liberalisation of  the economy has caused some confusion in the analysis of costs in health care  offered by public and private sectors. Factors that contribute to such  confusion include:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The easy availability of knowledge about the  latest biomedical technology even while it is at a developmental stage and its  true role remains undefined.
					</li>
					<li>
						This advanced technology is available,  though at an extremely high cost, at public sector hospitals depending on the  clout of doctors involved in using that technology.
					</li>
					<li>
						The influence of the technological  innovations on the decision making attitudes of the physicians involved in  providing medical care varies.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wide publicity given to these high-tech  modalities of treatment in the media influences the recipients of health care -the patients.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Technological innovations increase costs and  cause a financial crisis in providing health care.
				</p>

				<h4>Commercial and political  forces</h4>
				<p>
					An even more insidious process is that of an industry being built around the  medical innovations with the in-built mechanisms of lobbying and media  projections. These innovations are proclaimed not only to be safe but as the  only scientific methods for treating the relevant illness. The medical  community and the public are thus stampeded toward the use of expensive best-of-the-latest gadgetry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inevitably, this leads to monopolistic medical  hegemony with very high hidden costs to society. Illich has proposed in his  essay that Western society has been made to subscribe to the view that the  human body is a mechanical entity capable of responding to mechanical attempts  to correct malfunction. This assumption facilitates the role of technology in  medical treatment, which is further advanced and reinforced through individual  and mass media channels. Business and political interests make their not-so-subtle impact and expensive technology gains general acceptance without  rigorous and critical appraisal.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are aware of the setbacks suffered by the  arms and ammunition industries in the West with the end of the cold war and  should be vigilant on the new warfare started by the medical technology  industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical sociologists must inquire into this phenomenon.  Their conclusions will befit patients, the medical community and governments in  formulating rational health policies.

				<h4>Areas of concern</h4>
				<p>
					There are four areas that cause anxiety:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						the physician's belief in efficacy of the  procedure without scientific validation;
					</li>
					<li>
						the physician's training and professional  and psychological need to use the latest procedure and the attendant  technology;
					</li>
					<li>
						patients' demand and need for the treatment  which in turn has been fanned by the media and
					</li>
					<li>
						financial considerations.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>A case study</h4>
				<p>
					I have chosen the treatment of cardiac diseases as an example only because of  my familiarity with it. Similar conclusions can be drawn on treatment of other  diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Biomedical technology has made tremendous  advances possible both in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac ailments.  First came the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the 1970s and 1980s.  Then followed innovations like angioplasty, use of the rotablator, atherectomy  and stents. These have attracted widespread attention as compelling examples of  medical technology running uncontrolled. CABG and percutaneous transluminal  coronary angioplasty (PTCA) have become household terms. Balloon dilatation in  the treatment of mitral stenosis or closure of small holes in the heart with  expensive devices are other examples of technology leading decision making by  physicians when effective,safe and less expensive surgical alternatives are  available and have been validated by time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Extensive media coverage biases patients into  demanding non-surgical procedures. This adds to costs and advances the already  enormous role of technology and further growth of the medical-industrial  complex.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proliferating cath-labs/ angio-suites  and cardiac surgical facilities all over the country along with attendant  facilities like stress test, echocardiographic and colour Doppler laboratories  have already gathered the momentum of an industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Governments find it increasingly difficult to  afford these facilities in public hospitals and are, at the same time, unable  to restrain or curtail these. The lack of rigorous evaluation is deplorable,  many of these procedures being adopted without medical justification.
				</p>
				<p>
					The budget allocations for health are, as  such, low and fixed. Adoption of these sophisticated and often unjustified  machines and techniques in teaching hospitals results in diversion of already  meagre funds from other disciplines which are more important but with a low  profile.
				</p>

				<h4>Critical appraisal of  new technology needed</h4>
				<p>
					The introduction of new biomedical technology therefore needs critical  evaluation before it is employed. When justified, the introduction of expensive  machines must be controlled not only in hospitals funded by public money but  also in private hospitals which are established with a view to high returns on  every investment. The range of new drugs and equipment available is such that  it is no longer possible for medical professionals to keep track of -leave alone  evaluate -all the advances. Health care personnel are being provided more and  costly options without proper guidance. Funds remain limited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Policy makers need to make tough choices and  enforce them. That the responsibility to use new technology cannot be left with  the healthcare professionals alone was realised by no less a body than US  Congress way back in 1972. A Congressional Office of Technology Assessment was  established (OTA) to evaluate, analyse and coordinate data on new machines and  techniques from different sources. Healthcare Technology Assessment (HCTA) is  routinely carried out today in many advanced countries like the UK, Sweden,  Australia, France, Spain, Canada, Italy and Finland.
				</p>
				<p>
					We desperately need such institutions in  India. They can be established under the auspices of the Health Ministry but  must be granted independence and autonomy if they are to remain credibile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Till such bodies are available, it is  imperative to form guidelines for evaluating the utility of new procedures  based on technology alone. Such an evaluation should also decide as to what  amount of resources can appropriately be devoted to cost-intensive,  technology-based treatment decisions specially where effective and economical  alternatives are available. Such evaluation and regulation based on it will in  turn help the government to maintain costs as well as standard of medical care  at an affordable level.
