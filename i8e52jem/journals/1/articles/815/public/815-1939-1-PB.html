					The  World Association of Medical Editors (WAME) has recently released  recommendations on Publication Ethics Policies for medical journals so that the  publication process is thorough, objective and fair. The detailed guidelines  are available at http://wame.orgpubethicrecom.htm.  The association suggests that these recommendations be the base on which  individual journals make their guidelines. However, these principles should  either be published or maintained on the website so as to be accessible to  readers, authors and reviewers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some  facts that would interest readers of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> are  stated below.
				</p>
				<p>
					Informed  consent by participants should always be sought. If not possible, an institutional  review board must decide if this is ethically acceptable. Journals should have  explicit policies as to whether these review board approvals must be documented  by the authors, or simply attested to in their cover letter, and how they  should be described in the manuscript.
				</p>
				<p>
					Who  will be an author and in what sequence should be determined by the participants  early in the research process to avoid disputes and misunderstandings which can  delay or prevent publication of a paper.
				</p>
				<p>
					Journals  should discourage 'honorary' authorship. A conflict of interest results if some  fact known to a participant in the publication process is revealed later and  makes a reasonable reader feel misled or deceived (or an author, reviewer or  editor feel defensive). Reviewers as well as editors of the journal should also  be asked to routinely declare any similar competing interests, financial or  non-financial, that might affect their work for the journal. If peer reviewers  suspect misconduct, they should notify the editor in confidence. There should  be an explicit written policy on the procedure that will be followed if an  author appeals a decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Re-publication  of a paper in another language, or simultaneously in multiple journals with  different audiences may be acceptable, provided there is full and prominent  disclosure of its original source at the time of submission of the manuscript.
				</p>
				<p>
					Authors  should be discouraged from holding press conferences to publicise their  abstract results, as these results are preliminary and generally the complete  report has not yet undergone peer review. Journals should address these  concerns in their formal policies on originality of submitted materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Self-plagiarism  refers to authors' practice of using portions of their previous writings on the  same topic in another publication, without citing it in quotes. If journals  have developed a policy on this matter, it should be clearly stated to the  authors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Editorial  decisions should not be influenced by advertising revenue or reprint potential.  Commercial advertisements should not be placed adjacent to any editorial matter  that discusses the advertised product nor adjacent to any article reporting  research on the advertised product, nor should they refer to an article in the  same issue in which they appear. Journals must have the right to refuse any  advertisement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Journals  should have a clear policy on handling concerns or allegations about misconduct  of authors, reviewers, editors and others to help protect the integrity of  public scientific records. Journals should have an explicit policy describing  the process by which they will respond to allegations of misconduct. Such  allegations should be kept confidential.
				</p>
				<p>
					Journals  should have a policy describing their governance and relationship to the  sponsoring society. The relationship between owners and editors-in-chief should  be based on mutual respect and trust, and recognition of each other's authority  and responsibilities because conflicts can damage the intellectual integrity  and reputation of the journal, and its financial success.
