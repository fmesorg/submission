				<h4>Invitation to help design an online module for ethics teaching</h4>
				<p>
					The Workshop on <em>Promoting professionalism and ethical practices in medicine</em> was held on January 10, 2014, in Kolkata. One of the aims of the workshop was to promote professionalism and ethical practice by global Indian doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					To address the problem of the lack of a designated under graduate curriculum on Medical Ethics we plan to develop a high quality online ethics module so that universities and medical colleges can use them. We hope to involve a group of experts to create a concise, user friendly module with the hope of reaching out to many students who can learn from the module.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want the learning resources for undergraduates to be interesting, concise and include 3-6 hours self-learning [of course to get essential ethics in that format is going to be a challenge].
				</p>
				<p>
					We have the support of people's uni as a platform for the module <a href="http://courses.peoples-uni.org/" target="_blank">http://courses.peoples-uni.org/</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>We invite interested people to be involved in this exciting and challenging new venture.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Experts, researchers, post graduates, and anyone with an interest in this project is welcome to join the project. All you need is time, interest and the will to help and share your expertise. </strong>
