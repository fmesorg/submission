				<h4>Prof. Campbell moves <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jones G, Campbell Alistair V: Pastoral theologian and bioethicist.

					The Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, has inaugurated a new chair  of Medical Ethics. Alistair V Campbell who was the Director of the Bioethics  Research Centre [Otago, New Zealand] and Professor of Biomedical ethics from  April 1990 to July 1996 is the first appointee to the chair. Professor  Campbell, a theologian and a non-medical person is a well known figure in the  field of bioethics. He is the founding editor of <em>Journal of  Medical Ethics</em> and is the author of <em>Practical  Medical Ethics</em>, <em>Rediscovering  Pastoral Care</em> and <em>Paid to Care:  The limits of professionalism in pastoral care</em> - clearly indicating his ability and expertise  in two fields which are apparently quite diverse. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jones G, Campbell Alistair V: Pastoral theologian and bioethicist. Otago Bioethics Report 1996; 5: 1-2." id="1">(1)</a> In an interview, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Otago Bioethics Report 1996; 5: 5-6." id="2">(2)</a> he  explained that the fundamental task of any ethics committee was to take an  objective look at the risks and benefits of a procedure or trial. He also  stated that a clinical trial was of two types - therapeutic and safety trial.  In a safety trial, the aim was to confirm that a substance had no adverse side- effects and was safe; a therapeutic trial has to be beneficial to the  participants. It is important to differentiate between the two for ethical  reasons.

				<h4>Humanities in medicine <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Horowitz H W. Poetry on rounds: a model for the integration of humanities into residency training. The Lancet 1996; 347: 447- 449" id="3">(3)</a></h4>
				<p>
					There is little doubt  that the present generation of doctors are more materialistic and less humane  than their predecessors were. In Bombay, attempts to counter this have led to  the formation of the Forum for Medical Ethics and this journal. A recent  article in the <em>Lancet</em> suggests that the introduction of the humanities in medical  studies may also make a difference. Harold Horowitz introduced poetry  recitation and discussion sessions among members of his unit on his rounds.  This allowed them to expand on health related aspects which are not  conventionally taught during the course of a medical education as well as on  life in general. His impression at the end of the sessions was that the  discussion of poetry improved interpersonal relationships among team members of  the unit and improved patient-doctor rapport.

				<h4>Euthanasia <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ryan C J, Kaye M K.

				<p>
					Euthanasia is a topic  that has been discussed in the columns of this journal before. We now learn  that the parliament of Australia's Northern Territory has passed an act that  makes voluntary euthanasia legal. This act allows physicians to prescribe and  even administer lethal substances to terminally ill patients who wish to end  their lives. There are of course, a number of clauses to be satisfied in order  to avoid mistakes or foul play. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ryan C J, Kaye M K. Euthanasia in Australia- the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally ill Act. New England Journal of Medicine 1996; 334: 326- 328." id="4">(4)</a>

					The state of Oregon, USA had passed a similar  ruling in 1994, a decision which was stayed in 1995. In a study conducted among  physicians in Oregon , [before the ban], 60 % thought that physician - assisted  suicide should be legalised while 46% would be willing to prescribe a lethal  dose of medication, if required to do so. Surprisingly, half of all the  respondents were not sure what drug to prescribe for euthanasia, nor were they  confident of recognising terminal illness [less than six months to live].  Further, 28% were unsure of being able to recognise depression in patients.  Euthanasia, then, would appear to be a more complicated issue than expected. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lee MA et al.

					While on the subject of euthanasia, Jack  Kevorkian, the American pathologist who has been aiding patients in their  attempts to die without suffering, has once again been acquitted by a Michigan  court. Kevorkian has assisted 28 people since 1990. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roberts J, Kjellstrand C. Jack Kevorkian : a medical hero.

				<h4>Drugs in Maharashtra <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Collier, J. Medicines mismatch. The Lancet. 347; 212: 1996" id="7">(7)</a></h4>
				<p>
					An editorial in <em>The Lancet</em> refers to the findings of The Foundation for Research in  Community Health on the provision of medicines in Satara, a district in  Maharashtra state. It appears that government spending on drugs for the public  sector amounted to only 2.6 % of the total drug budget for all people in  Satara. The reason for this low figure is probably due to irregular supply of  drugs, substandard materials, and lack of supply. For instance, Adrenaline was  available for less than 25 % of the days in the primary health centres - a  finding which does horrifies us, but does not surprise us. We are aware of  larger hospitals in big cities which can boast of the same record. Is anyone  listening ? The authors conclude by saying that better and continual education  of medicos and paramedical staff, better drug supplies and prevention of the  excessive influence of drug companies would be effective in curing more people  at the same cost.

				<h4>Views on ethics <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jacobsen G, Hals A. Medical investigators views about ethics and fraud in medical research. Monash Bioethics Review 1996; 15: Ethics committees : A special supplement, pages 2-9." id="8">(8)</a></h4>
				<p>
					What do medical investigators in Norway think about ethics and fraud in medical  research ? Jacobsen and Hals set out to find the attitudes of over a hundred  investigators and learned that there was both, good as well as bad news. About  80 % felt that ethical considerations had influenced their research and 70 %  found that the suggestions of the ethics committees were useful and relevant.  The disturbing part was that only 43% stated that they would never publish  scientific data obtained from studies that were ethically unacceptable and a  similar proportion believed that ethical considerations were sand in the  machinery. The authors conclude that committees make a major contribution to  quality assessment in medical science .Importantly, they, as  well as many of the participants, feel that the committee should also assess the scientific  validity of the study.
