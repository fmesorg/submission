				<h4>Noble intentions can be dangerous</h4>
				<p>
					A long time ago, I had a T shirt, on the front of which was written: "I took the least travelled path and look where the hell I am!" Dr Binayak Sen's case is no different. Dr Sen, who languished in jail for nearly two years (for a crime which is yet to be established), has taught me some things both about being an Indian and being a doctor. First, in India you cannot be an atheist because if the mighty state machinery wants to keep you behind bars and destroy your peace and well being: only God can save you. So you do need to believe in the almighty! Second, if you are a doctor, be very careful if you intend to practise in the under-served areas of the country. Many young doctors have such noble ideas but they should learn from Dr Sen's experience. Many of us think of going to a downtrodden rural area to serve the ill and the poor. Dr Binayak Sen had the courage to do this, and look where he ended up.

					I would like to congratulate the Chhattisgarh government for accomplishing what not many a despot can even think of doing, and that is to demoralise a whole generation of Indians like me through the methodical use of executive and judicial powers. It is even more frightening that the ruling BJP intends to use the so-called "Chhattisgarh model" across the country if it is voted to power in the current elections. I earnestly hope that their dream (and my nightmare) remains unfulfilled so that we do not see many more Binayak Sens languishing behind bars.
