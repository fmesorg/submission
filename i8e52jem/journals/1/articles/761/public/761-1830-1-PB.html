  <h4>Jerome Groopman, MD. The anatomy of hope: how people
    prevail in the face of illness. Random House, New York 2004,
  ISBN 0-375-50638-1.</h4>
  <p>Dr Groopman, a member of the haematogy-oncology faculty at
    Harvard Medical School, USA, has written many popular articles
    explaining intricacies of medicine. In this, his third book, he
  describes how people cope with serious illness.</p>
  <p>He starts out by recounting the story of a young orthodox
    Jewish woman with advanced breast cancer. She asked Dr
    Groopman, who is Jewish, to be part of her treatment team
    even though he was just an intern. After surgery she confided
    to Dr Groopman that she had had an affair with her boss and
    the cancer was retribution for her sin. As a penance she initially
    refused chemotherapy. When she ultimately agreed, it was too
  late to change the outcome.</p>
  <p>Young physicians were only taught to diagnose and treat
    illnesses but not how to interact with patients where hope is
    interwoven into their background and beliefs. Dr Groopman
    was unable to work through the patient's beliefs and lead her to
  hope for a different life.</p>
  <p>The author then illustrates the difference between false and true
    hope. He describes a patient with advanced colon cancer being
    held in check by increasingly strong chemotherapy. Whenever
    the patient or her daughter was seen by Dr Groopman, he
    maintained a positive attitude despite a bleak prognosis. As the
    end neared, the daughter expressed resentment that she and
    her mother had not been told the truth. Dr Groopman says that
    he felt guilty that the patient and her family had been given a
  false sense of hope.</p>
  <p>True hope is based on knowledge and facts and not on denial
    of adversity. Dr Groopmans encountered this when a senior
    colleague and mentor battled his stomach cancer, a disease
    with poor prognosis. Colleagues were saddened to see the
    physician ask for, and receive, the latest aggressive treatments.
    They thought he was unreasonably optimistic. He proved their
    predictions wrong. When Dr Groopman asked how he continued
    treatment despite the grim statistics, the physician said he hoped
    that he would be among the slim percentage that survived, a
  hope based on a realistic assessment of his chances.</p>
  <p>Groopman argues that hope is constructed from a rational
    deliberation of options and an amalgam of past experiences
    and feelings. He describes a man who refused treatment for a treatable lymphoma because he had seen his close friend die
    an agonising death from a similar cancer. He relates his own
    tenacious struggle with severe pain and limitation following
    spinal surgery and how hope kept him going with daily physical
  therapy.</p>
  <p>Groopman is critical of Dr Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's work on death
    and dying. She encouraged patients to keep hoping for a miracle,
    until the end. "Hope need not be a miracle," says Groopman. Hope
    can have purpose and meaning. He describes the prolonged
    course of a patient with breast cancer who accepted that there
    was no cure for her disease. What was possible was a remission,
    a waiting period of indeterminate length. During these periods
  the patient continued an active meaningful life.</p>
  <p>Finally he examines the biological basis of hope. Can hope
    contribute biologically to recovery? Groopman finds that the
    popular media promotes charismatic methods to channel the
    mind's energy towards healing. The implication is that if the
    problem persists then the patient is somehow at fault. He feels
    that the occasional mysterious recoveries should be investigated
    scientifically. When he discusses this with a psychiatrist who has
    been studying the mind-body connection, he is told, "The mind
    is a manifestation of the brain. Products of the mind, thoughts,
    feelings, emotions, are a mix of chemicals and electrical circuits
    that have evolved over millennia..." The mind-body connection
    is an artificial construct. Placebos work through beliefs and
    expectations and placebos produce physiological results by
    altering brain pathways and chemicals. Variability in genetic and
    environmental factors may explain why some respond better
    than others. Past and present environments may shape brain
    circuits that produce neurotransmitters to produce different
    effects. Dr Davidson, an experimental psychologist, aims to
    understand how the brain generates enabling emotions. To
    him, hope is an interaction of cognitive and affective parts.
    Hope modifies how people reason. Fear, another brain emotion,
    counter balances hope. Without fear a person may be excessively
  optimistic which Groopman considers false hope.</p>
  <p>Groopman has learned that "it takes much more than mere
    words to communicate information and to alter affect. ...Each
    disease is uncertain in its outcome and in that uncertainty we
    find real hope because a tumor has not read the text book and
    a treatment can have an unexpectedly dramatic impact. ...This
    is the great paradox of true hope: Because nothing is absolutely
    determined there is not only reason to fear but also reason to
  hope."</p>
