					Unsafe abortions,  criminal or illegal, are a cause of excessive maternal morbidity, mortality and  misery. Human experimentation with new methods of abortion in contravention of  stipulations and guidelines fall in the same category.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anybody who inflicts, encourages  or condones unsafe abortion in contravention of the law commits a crime. Yet,  articles in journals describe unsafe abortions and identify the person who  conducted it, and the place where it was performed. The articles published in  the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sinha R, Bara MM.

None of these  mention the steps taken against the culprits.
				</p>
				<p>
					All cases of maternal mortality due to unsafe and unlicensed abortions are  cases of double homicide (murder) and are required under law (CrPC. Section 39  and 174 read with IPC Sections 201, 299, 312 and 314) to be reported to the  police, subjected to inquest, and criminal prosecutions launched. By not doing  so, the authors are presumed to be siding with the criminals. The documentation  of these murders should not be published as research articles. Such  publications amount to documented defiance of law and criminal justice.
				</p>
				<p>
					As regards the editor's  responsibilities, they must be satisfied that authors reporting a crime through  their journal have done all that they were legally required to do in that  particular case.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research in the cases of septic and unsafe abortion has to cover two aspects:  injuries and their treatment, and the possible cause of the injury. A properly  done medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) should not cause injury to the  bladder or gut. If this occurs, there must be either some unrecognised  abnormality in the patient or a lapse in the procedure. The researcher must try  to elucidate it to prevent its occurrence in future.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, illegal abortions are apparently not considered criminal and are not  reported to the police, even when they prove fatal. This attitude is  exemplified by the observations of the attending doctors in the report of an  illegal abortion done by a 'dai' with a stick that resulted in gas gangrene.  The abortion was done by an unauthorised person and it was an unnatural death  with manifest evidence of foul play on the record. Exactly the same assertion  has been made <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sinha R, Bara MM. Maternal mortality in unsafe abortion. J Obstet Gynecol India 2001;51:123-125." id="1">(1)</a>, when the authors state 'Autopsy was advised in all these  cases, but refused by relatives', exemplifying the attitude of medical  professionals not to report unnatural deaths in women.

				<h4>Chemical  abortificeant paste</h4>
				<p>
					As a result of an unhealthy enthusiasm to popularise abortions for population  control, Fetex paste was licensed and publicised as an abortificient. This  paste has been reported to cause severe peritonitis, gangrene of organs and  kidney failure in many patients. In a 1985 report of three cases <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatt S, Bandi S. The dangerous Fetex paste. J Obstet Gynecal India 1985;35:27-29." id="7">(7)</a>, two died  and the third survived renal failure but her 'whole vagina and cervix were  sloughed and necrosed' after the illegal abortion with 'Fetex paste'. The  authors pleaded 'Advertisements...should be stopped and the product should be  withdrawn...'. The Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India was one such  journal advertising the Fetex paste. Following these reports, this preparation  by Gambers Laboratory, was 'withdrawn' and 'banned'. However, in a recent report  of the death of 34 women who died of septic abortion, in 25 'kutchi' was used  by 'dai/quack', Fetex paste was used in 3 patients by general practitioners  (GPs) <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reddi Rani P, Bupathy A, Balsubramanian S. Maternal mortality due to septic abortion. J Obstet Gynecol India 1996;46:73-76." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					What can be a worse reflection on the prevailing professional standards, ethics  and the role of drugs control machinery than the fact that year after year of  reports of severe adverse effects and fatal outcomes from the use of the  chemical abortificeant paste, nobody questions how this obviously dangerous  paste was permitted to be licensed as an abortificeant paste? Was it ethical  for the practitioners of medicine to use this Ayurvedic preparation? Was it  ethical to advertise it in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology of India,  the official organ of the Federation?

				<h4>MTP: saga of inhuman  experiments</h4>
				<p>
					Any form of physical or chemical interference with the fetus is potentially  noxious enough to cause abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy during which MTP  is permitted. Even introduction of a fine needle for aspiration of amniotic  fluid may result in abortion. But simply because MTP is permitted does not mean  one can experiment with any substance or method. Yet, some studies <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Desai P, Patel P. Prospective comparative evaluation of intra-amniotic versus extra-amniotic routes for ethacridine lactate for second trimester MTP: no difference.

These have  been used to experiment and re-experiment upon thousands of women and have been  reported as research publications.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these are human experiments. No good journal today publishes a report  unless the authors provide a proof of ethics committee clearance. Recruitment  of patients has to be on the basis of informed and free consent. Any substance  or device used in the human body is a drug. Even an approved drug when used for  a different purpose or by a different route or different dose schedule or  combination constitutes a new drug, the human trial of which needs prior  approval of the drugs controller.
				</p>
				<p>
					None of the aforesaid 'studies' appear to conform to the ethical standards for  human experiments. How could instillation of distilled water <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kaur D, Shergill S, Saini S, Singh N. Comparative evaluation of ethacridine lactate, normal saline and distilled water in mid-trimester abortions. J Obstet Gynecol India 1997;47:160-163." id="9">(9)</a>, boiling  water, a powdered tablet <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nayak AH, Shah BP, Alwani CM. Extra-amniotic instillation of tablet primprost with ethacridine lactate for termination of second trimester pregnancy. J Obstet Gynecol India 1996;46:753-758." id="13">(13)</a> or rubber catheter <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh A, Roy H, Dixit P, Manav N, Roy S. Termination of pregnancy by combined intrauterine catheter and laminaria tent. J Obstet Gynecol India 1996;46:618-623." id="12">(12)</a> be permitted? Imagine the  indignity and discomfort of a Foley's catheter introduced in the uterus, its  balloon inflated and left in a pregnant woman for 6-18 hours. How does it  differ from the use of a sterile stick and cow's urine by quacks?
				</p>
				<p>
					In my book 'Miscarriage of Medicine' (Panchsheel Prakashan, Jaipur, 1993,  chapter entitled 'Merciless assault on mother's womb' p. 34), I had quoted  papers from the early 1980s which gave data on similar studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the rationale of  repeating these experiments when the disadvantages of many of them have already  been adequately evaluated? There is no evidence that any thought has been given  to plan these trials to obviate biased inferences. As a result, most of the  studies are exercises in futility. Why increase the risk to the women  undergoing these trials? There is no evidence that clearance of the ethics  committee was taken before conducting the trials. No informed consent was  taken. And worse, the Indian Council of Medical Research is a party to it all  by commission and omission.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anybody doing anything to terminate pregnancy is not only permitted to do so  but the act goes unchallenged even if it kills or cripples the woman. It is no  exaggeration to state that medical termination of pregnancy has come to be a  'pragmatic termination of maternity'.
