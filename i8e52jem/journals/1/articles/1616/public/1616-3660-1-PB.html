					Hon. Minister for Health and Family  Welfare,
					<br>
					Govt. of India,
					<br>
					New Delhi
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Subject:</strong> Request for appropriate response by the  MOHFW to the illogical and distorted manner in which Medical Council of India  is seeking to interpret clause 6.8 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional  Conduct, Etiquette and  Ethics) Regulations, 2002.
				</p>

				<p>
					Respected Shri Ghulam Nabi Azad,
				</p>
				<p>
					We, the undersigned, representing  the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), the  Medico Friends Circle (MFC) and the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME),  would like to bring to your notice the need for a prompt and appropriate response  by MOHFW to the tendentious and distorted manner in which the Medical Council  of India (MCI) has recently sought to interpret clause 6.8 of the Indian  Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.  The above organizations represent nationwide coalitions of social  organizations, health professionals and academia working for people's health  rights, equitable access to essential medicines, and the upholding of ethical  norms and values by the medical community.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you would be aware, in the recent  meeting of the Executive Committee of the Medical Council of India on 18th  February 2014, it was decided to interpret clause 6.8 of the Indian Medical  Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 in a manner  that would exempt 'Professional Associations of Doctors' from the purview of  the Medical Ethics committee of MCI. It should be noted that amendment 6.8 of  Ethics regulations was added in December 2009, following the widespread misuse  of the loopholes in Ethics regulation 2002 by professional associations of  doctors, including the Indian Medical Association. It is logically untenable  and highly objectionable that the MCI should exclude associations of medical  professionals from the ethical standards that are expected of individual  doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is surprising that this amendment  was not demanded of MCI by any professional association of doctors, neither did  any court direct them to do so. This decision, as suggested by the minutes of  the above-mentioned Executive Committee meeting, was purportedly linked to the  'the proceedings of a case filed by Max Hospitals in Delhi High Court in 2013',  which actually bears no substantive relationship to the decision that was  taken. While the MCI Executive Committee's linking of 'Max Hospitals vs. MCI  case' with its decision is quite bereft of any conceivable rationale, <strong><em>MCI's  move to abdicate its own responsibility to regulate the ethical conduct of  professional associations of doctors is nothing short of being grossly irresponsible</em></strong>.  We cannot conceive how an action that is ethically impermissible for an  individual doctor can become permissible if a group of doctors carry out the  same action in form of an association. It may be emphasised that the Code of  Medical Ethics was amended in 2009 by specifically adding the section "6.8 code of  conduct for doctors <strong>and professional association of doctors</strong> in their  relationship with pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry" (emphasis  added), to bring  professional associations of doctors, in addition to the individual medical  practitioners, under the jurisdiction of ethical regulation by MCI.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is notable that specific punitive actions against office bearers of Indian  Medical Association (IMA) are currently pending with the ethics committee of  MCI, particularly related to the contract signed between IMA and PepsiCo foods  in 2008, wherein IMA had agreed to publicly endorse certain PepsiCo products.  We appreciate that you personally had made a statement in the Lok Sabha in November,  2010 in which you had declared that action would be taken by MCI against the  office bearers of IMA, due to their illegal and unethical endorsement of  PepsiCo products. Given this context, the recent biased interpretation of the  Code of medical ethics by MCI, which would exonerate IMA of all responsibility  for its grossly unethical actions, poses extremely serious questions regarding  the underlying motives of MCI executive members while taking the said decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  this context, speaking on behalf of ordinary citizens and ethical health  professionals, the undersigned organisations would like to strongly suggest  that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should take urgent action  in context of the retrograde and ill conceived move by the Medical Council of  India, to prevent the proposed misinterpretation of clause 6.8 of MCI  regulation, 2002 which seeks to exempt professional associations of doctors  from the purview of ethics regulation by MCI. This is necessary to protect  ordinary people from the consequences of unethical actions by professional  medical associations like IMA, and to give a strong public message that  promotion of the health rights of ordinary people would override the narrow  commercialised interests of certain associations of medical professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking  forward to appropriate action by your office,
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours  Sincerely,
				</p>
				<p>
