					According to estimates of the National AIDS  Control Organisation, there are 4.58 million people living with HIV/AIDS in  India <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma S. The world vs. AIDS, 2004. India's growing AIDS problem. World Press Review 2004;51. Available from URL: http://www.worldpress.org/article_model.cfm?article_id=1858&dont=yes (accessed June 18, 2004)." id="1">(1)</a>. An effective vaccine is considered to be one of the strategies to  deal with the rapid spread of HIV infection in the country <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jayaraman KS. India targets local HIV strain in test of AIDS vaccine. Nature 2004;427:185." id="2">(2)</a>. I suggest that  an overemphasis on preventive HIV vaccine research in India undermines the  therapeutic HIV vaccine research needs and violates the ethical principle of  distributive justice. Further, the vaccine campaign must address the  vulnerability of potential trial participants and limits of regulatory  mechanisms.

				<h4>The choice between  preventive and therapeutic vaccine</h4>
				<p>
					Preventive HIV vaccines are designed to  prevent HIV infection whereas therapeutic HIV vaccines are designed to boost  the immune response of a person already infected with the virus <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Institutes of Health. Vaccine glossary, 2000. Available from URL: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/GLOSSARY.htm (accessed on May 6, 2004)." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethical dilemmas of promoting a preventive HIV  vaccine over a therapeutic vaccine in developing countries have been  acknowledged by some commentators <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Berkley S. Thorny issues in the ethics of AIDS vaccine trials. Lancet 2003;362:992." id="4">(4)</a>. Leading proponents of distributive  justice advocate that members of society should have equal resources and the  power to use these resources <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sen AK. Inequality Reexamined. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992." id="5">(5)</a>. The selection of research direction, emphasis  of research, choice between preventive and therapeutic vaccine are not value  neutral decisions in the Indian context. The distribution of public goods,  including the products of scientific discovery, is unequally structured on the  lines of caste, socioeconomic status, geographical location, sex and age.
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of people living with HIV infection  in India are unaware of their vulnerability and their HIV status. Many live in  grinding poverty and are deprived of the basic health care facilities. The  urgent needs of these people should take priority on the research agenda. A  preventive HIV vaccine may not bring dramatic changes in the quality of life of  these people.
				</p>
				<p>
					The results of preliminary trials and other  scientific data indicate that commercial production and distribution of a  preventive HIV vaccine are several decades away <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Esparaza J, Bhamarapravati N. Acclerating the development and future availability of AIDS vaccines. Lancet 2000;355:206-6." id="6">(6)</a>. The continuing genetic  mutation of the virus could even make a universally effective HIV vaccine an  unrealistic expectation <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Collins C. Policy issues in AIDS vaccine development. 2001. http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite.jsp?page=kb-08-01-11 (accessed on June 18, 2004)." id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some researchers have argued that a preventive  vaccine represents the best long-term hope for HIV/AIDS control <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Esparza J, Osmano S. HIV vaccines: a global perspective. WHO-UNAIDS HIV vaccine Initiative. Geneva: WHO, 2003;183-93." id="8">(8)</a>. I suggest  that even if a universal HIV preventive vaccine becomes available, the long-term  hope for HIV/AIDS prevention is in political commitment, in programmes that  reduce the vulnerability of specific population groups, and in addressing  health inequities nationally and globally. A biomedical solution will not  provide an exclusive long-term solution <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Johnson RP, Kalams S. The science of HIV vaccine development.1998 http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/nSite? page=kb-02-01-06" id="9">(9)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					About 90% of HIV transmission among adults is  through unprotected sexual intercourse. Reduction in HIV transmission through  sex is possible through consistent and correct use of condoms. However,  vulnerability to HIV transmission and the ability to identify and reduce are  unequally distributed according to sex and socioeconomic status <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Loewenson R, Whiteside A. HIV/AIDS implications for poverty reduction. UNDP Policy Paper, 2001." id="10">(10)</a>. A  programme for universal HIV prevention vaccination will face similar obstacles.
				</p>
				<p>
					HIV prevention strategies must also address  structural factors contributing to the vulnerability of women and marginalised  populations, and social support needs of people living with HIV infection <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bloom DE, Sevilla J. HIV/AIDS and development in Asia and the Pacific. A lengthening shadow. Asia Pacific Ministerial meeting, Melbourne, Australia, 2001." id="11">(11)</a>.  This proposal may be weakened by unrealistic expectations created by advocacy  for an HIV preventive vaccine in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this context, one must carefully analyse the  ethical implications of investing only in a preventive HIV vaccine, and weigh  the opportunity costs of not investing in a therapeutic HIV vaccine.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Why therapeutic HIV  vaccine research must take precedence in India</h4>
				<p>
				Therapeutic HIV vaccines offer greater  opportunities to strengthen the broader response to the epidemic and immediate  benefits to health care delivery systems. A therapeutic vaccine could  contribute to the reduction in burden of disease and enhancing the quality of  life of people living with HIV infection. Advocacy for preventive vaccines must  not compromise the need for a therapeutic HIV vaccine.</p>
				<p>Due to the lack of data and experience in dealing  with HIV therapy in resource-poor settings, the Indian generic pharmaceutical  industry's capacity to provide cheaper anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs is not fully  exploited by health care providers. The current standardised ARV therapy may  soon run out of therapeutic options, as they become less effective on large  populations. An aggressive therapeutic HIV vaccine research programme can offer  alternative solutions. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Testing on vulnerable  populations</h4>
				<p>
					Careful considerations are to be made in testing  an HIV vaccine on vulnerable populations. It is necessary to ask questions  about HIV preventive vaccine research in developing countries: Are all  individuals equally capable of taking informed decisions irrespective of their  sociocultural context? Are individuals entirely responsible for the  consequences of their 'informed decisions'? Will clinical trial investigators  ensure the best interests of clinical trial participants?
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of participants in preventive vaccine  trials are to be recruited from vulnerable populations. They will have to take  a number of unquantified risks-the biological risk of getting infected with  HIV; unknown side- and long-term effects of the vaccine; unmet treatment needs;  social and economic consequences such as loss of income; loss of existing  insurance cover, incidental costs such as travel, cost of seeking legal and  medical advice, disturbance of domestic life and potential stigma and  discrimination.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need to further discuss the conflict of  interest between trial volunteers who surely want to stay uninfected at all  costs, and researchers 'needing' some people to become infected to prove that  those vaccinated are genuinely protected.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Need for data on  behavioural and social issues</h4>
				<p>
					Discussion on the ethics of a preventive vaccine  must be based on information on people's beliefs about HIV illness and vaccine  efficacy; factors influencing willingness to participate in trials and their  understanding of technical concepts such as placebos and the double blind  methodology. There must be data on issues such as the meaning of inducement in  resource-poor settings; minimum standards of informed consent processes,  counselling procedures and confidentiality requirements.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Regulatory framework</h4>
				<p>
					Commentators have noted that Indian regulatory  agencies are weak and medical councils refuse to act against errant doctors  <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mudur G. Use of antibiotic in contraceptive trial sparks controversy. BMJ 2004;328:188." id="12">(12)</a>. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the key partner in the  Indian HIV vaccine consortium, has so far not been able to punish those who  violate its ethical guidelines. In the absence of a comprehensive legal  framework, how will ICMR demonstrate that it can enforce its ethical  guidelines?
				</p>
				<p>
					In developed countries, Data and Safety Monitoring  Boards are committees of independent clinical research experts who review data  while a clinical trial is in progress and ensure that participants are not  exposed to undue risk. They are empowered to review data and may also recommend  that a trial be modified or stopped if there are safety concerns, or if the  trial's objectives have been achieved. Is such close scrutiny possible in  India?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Transparency</h4>
				<p>
					Investigators are obliged to make a statement on  ethical issues relating to their research and its resolution. There is no  evidence that members of the ethics committees of the vaccine trial have  rigorously analysed the ethical implications of the proposed trials. In the  absence of a detailed clinical trial protocol of the proposed HIV vaccine trial  in India, with details of risk and benefits- and how they were assessed-the  value of community consultations is reduced to a public relations exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consultation on the HIV vaccine trial in India  should be based on a 'white paper' on the risks and benefits of participating  in the trial and an in-depth debate on the priority and relative merit of a  preventive vaccine versus therapeutic vaccine.
