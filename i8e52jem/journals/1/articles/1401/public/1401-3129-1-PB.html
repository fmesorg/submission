					The following accounts  describe how hospitals in two different countries responded to the fact that  some of their patients may have been exposed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an  infectious and fatal neurological condition which is being increasingly documented  in the West. Are these concerns remote for Indians? Given the quality of  infection-prevention protocols, hospital-acquired infection is a serious  problem in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following her delivery by caesarean section in Hospital P, Ms Q returned home  but was later shifted to another hospital when she displayed symptoms of a  deteriorating neurological condition suggestive of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease (nvCJD). The infant was admitted along with the mother since it was  failing to thrive and appeared to have neurological signs &mdash; possibly the first  case of vertical transmission of this prion-based disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					The hospital where Ms Q delivered her baby was notified, and hospital  authorities identified the kit used on Ms Q. Though they immediately removed it  from circulation, they confirmed that seven other women had had caesarean  sections using the same theatre kit, after Ms Q, and before the hospital was  notified. The family obtained a court injunction prohibiting anyone from  publishing the name of mother or child or the name of any hospital at which  they were treated in newspapers, TV or other media.

				<h4>Should the seven patients have been traced and informed?</h4>
				<p>
					It was pointed out that if the authorities were sure of the instrument  disinfection process, if they could not identify the disease, but believed that  it could have been transmitted from mother to foetus, and there was nothing to  test or treat possible contacts, and no risk of further spread, there was no  point in pursuing this issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, a local newspaper ran a feature on CJD and Ms Q's case, as well as  the possibility of vertical transmission. As they could not name the hospital  because of the court injunction, they created a panic reaction for every woman  in the region who had recently given birth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Public health authorities could have responded by tracing the seven women,  telling them of their exposure and then putting out an announcement that no one  else need worry because the seven women had been told. They would inflict the  problem on the seven women in order to save everyone else distress.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the authorities were advised that this policy could cause the seven  women significant harm. It could create anxiety, provoke reactions from family  members, result in loss of their insurance, and so on. They recalled the early  days of HIV where sufferers whose status was accidentally discovered and  communicated to them without warning. Some women committed suicide.
				</p>
				<p>
					They therefore decided to make the information available to anyone who wished  to know, but giving patients the choice of knowing their particular status. A  public phone line was set up. Callers not from Hospital P were told not to  worry, as were for callers from Hospital P, who had given birth outside the  relevant period. Callers from Hospital P in the relevant period were issued a  special number at the hospital through which they reached a team of counsellors  who would contact the woman and discuss her risk.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					That's how one set of  authorities handled the problem. In another instance, 10 people who may have  contracted the CJD as a result of a breach of infection control, were informed  directly of their exposure by the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					A neurosurgeon treated a patient with dementia who may have had CJD, and reused  the equipment on 10 other patients, though according to the hospital's protocol  for brain biopsy where there is a risk of CJD, the equipment should not be  reused until a CJD diagnosis is excluded. The equipment was sterilised but the  risk of CJD is not eliminated by normal cleaning and sterilisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The hospital made the decision despite warnings that the information could  cause serious distress among some people, leading to suicide attempts. While  the risk to these patients is very low (a one in one million chance), there is  no test to determine whether a patient has caught CJD, and no treatment. The  argument was rejected that not all patients would comprehend how remote the  chances were of developing the disease, even with extensive explanations and  counselling, and there was a real risk of this distress leading to suicide.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the 10 patients potentially exposed to CJD died of an unrelated  condition. The other nine patients face a wait of up to 30 years to find out  whether they have contracted CJD because there is no accurate test for the  disease prior to symptoms surfacing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The health minister said patients and the public had a right to know about such  breaches of infection control procedures. "If patients, staff and the public  had heard of the infection control breakdown by other means, they would have  been extremely concerned. It would have also led to a potential panic or fear  among other patients at the hospital."
