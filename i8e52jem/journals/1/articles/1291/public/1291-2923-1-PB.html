				<h4>Prabha Krishnan, Health Care-Earth Care. Interrogating Health and Health Policy in India. Earthcare Books. Mumbai. 2000. 444 pages.</h4>
				<p>
					In this trenchant  critique of the health care system in India, Prabha Krishan argues that modern  medicine is reductionist and detrimental to the health of men and women. Her  book is divided into two sections - the first elucidating the problems and  limitations of modern medicine and science, the second looking in some detail  at the Health Awareness Centre in Mumbai that offers an alternative to these  systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Krishnan begins with an  analysis of the impact of multinational companies on Indian resources. She  studies the Bretton Woods institutions that ushered in the era of  neocolonialism, creating a market for American domination and a source of raw  material in the East. The Indian ruling classes have been complicit with this  process as they suffer from a sense of shame about Indian culture. This  includes a rejection of Indian traditions, dress and medicine. Thus the ruling  classes have actively supported the grafting of incompatible systems upon  Indian culture and the opening up of the market to foreign companies. Other  than the cultural aspect, however, the middle classes have been the main  beneficiaries of the liberalisation process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Krishnan points out that  within this paradigm, aspects of Indian traditions are accepted, if at all, in  fragments. Ayurveda is seen as alternative therapy not a way of life. It is  commercialised by drug companies that fragment it into pre-packaged products.  The health policies of the Indian State have reflected the class and gender  bias of the policy makers. Krishnan gives the example of the family planning  programme. The socially and politically dominant middle classes have a fear of  rising population among the poorer sections of society. This is seen as  dangerous, hence the bourgeoisie actively propagates coercive family planning  programmes that are unleashed primarily on the poor. The author points out,  however, that there is often a lack of internal or ideological coherence within  health policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book enumerates the  results of liberalisation on the Indian health sector. The substantial  reduction in state spending on health and other social sectors has led to the  poor being left out of health care. At another level, the State has displayed a  lack of commitment in providing good health to its people. For example,  reducing restrictions against foreign investment in tobacco firms completely  negates official policies on health.
				</p>
				<p>
					The issue of  environmental degradation is treated as arising out of human agency. Forty  years of modern farming have led to soil depletion and a drop in the nutritive  value of agricultural produce. Krishnan makes a convincing case against the  mantras of modern development paradigms that focus on increase in production  and better distribution, and argues instead for village level self-sufficiency  and distributive justice at the level of the means of production.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book addresses the  attitude of medical science towards women. The analysis is that women have been  the repositories of traditional wisdom and medicine, which has been  marginalised. Besides, there is little effort to understand the links between  the social oppression of women and its consequences for women's health. Instead  women are seen as 'social problems' and 'targets' by health planners. Health  care systems deal with the symptom, rather than the person and the social  milieu in which he or she is placed.
				</p>
				<p>
					All this arises out of a  reductionist attitude to health that focuses on disease elimination rather than  a daily commitment to the self and community. The body is seen as a machine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regarding some ethical issues in modern medicine, Krishan argues that modern  medical science belies our unstinting faith in it. There is a lack of rigour in  testing medicines; cases of medical negligence are frequent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book focuses on  efforts by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and people's groups to vest  accountability on the state. Two of the NGOs that she studies in some detail  are the Lok Swastaya Parampara Samwardhan Samiti, and the Vaishya AIDS Mukabla  Parishad, Maharashtra. Such groups perform a range of services including  creating village nurseries, herbal gardens and medicinal forests and providing  personal health care for sex workers. Some of these organisations  simultaneously question the use made of donor agency funds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other movements that  pose a more direct challenge to the development paradigm include the Narmada  Bachao Andolan and the Chipko movement. These redefine the concept of  development through the prism of 'ordinary' men and women.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second part of the  book is a detailed case study of the Health Awareness Centre in Mumbai. The  Centre opposes the germ theory that views disease as an external attack by  viruses and microbes, and believes that illness is caused by wrong life  practices. Good health can be attained through nutrition and proper lifestyle.  Ayurveda supports this theory.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book examines a  range of issues, raising concerns of ethics within modern medical practice.  Modern medicine is based on a relationship of inequality between the provider  and the seeker. It is reductionist in its approach to the human body and to  disease. The process of liberalisation has exacerbated the process of  alienation of people from policy makers and health providers. The book however  ends on a note of hope by looking at efforts that actively question modern  medical practices.
