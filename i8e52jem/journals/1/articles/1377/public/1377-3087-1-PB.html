				<h4>Suggestions for IME</h4>
				<p>
					I feel bad that the  journal, which is perhaps the only representative of any remnants of ethical  core of health care in India, is floundering due to problems with funds.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have thought about it  - with empathy born of having to sustain a bulletin on medical education myself  - and feel that there are many reasons for this problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your cover MUST look  more appealing; not the same sepulchral black border and depressing images  every time. After all, two colours are being used on the cover; why not design  it better? Maybe a layout artist can help. With a mix and match of the two  foreground colours, plus the background white, the cover can really be made  attractive and refreshing every time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Announce some prizes  (more like a citation or a certificate which costs little but means a lot) for  the best letter, the best essay on a topic (for medicos?). The winners could be  offered a special subscription.
				</p>
				<p>
					The content need not be  depressingly pessimistic. There are doctors and health facilities all over  India doing ethical and humane work. Such positive items could be highlighted.  For example, The Hindu covered a survey of people's beliefs on corrupt  professions (I think in 1998); the medical profession was voted the lowest  while the law and politicians scored highest on the corruption scale! What I  mean is there is a need to appreciate that at least half the cup is filled,  even while lamenting that the other half is empty.
				</p>
				<p>
					You do quite a few book  reviews. Most of these books find it difficult to get sold. You can try a symbiotic  approach: for subscribers of the journal, offer a discounted sale price of the  books. It may help all the three parties concerned - the writer to increase  sales, the subscriber to get more value for money spent and yourselves in terms  of increasing subscriptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a need to put  on the "what is in it for me" cap and plan out an allwin strategy.
				</p>
				<p>
					This may be a bitter  medicine for you, but I think you can allow sponsorship by ethical firms, just  displaying their name and logo without any advertising on their products. It is  not unethical to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I have written  a book entitled Trick or Treat, to be published with the help of the Consumer  InternationalRegional office for Asia Pacific (CIROAP), Penang, Malysia. I can  submit one chapter per issue of Issues in Medical Ethics; there are 52 chapters  big and small, and this could go on for a few years as a serial. I can also  work out a big discount for your subscribers. This is the least I could do to  support your cause.
