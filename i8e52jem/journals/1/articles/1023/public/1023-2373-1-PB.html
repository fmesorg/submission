				<h4>The case of the controversial cervical cancer vaccine.</h4>
				<p>
					The advertising campaign by the multinational drug firm Merck
					promoting its high profile cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil has
					left Indian households confused and health workers worried.
					The 15-second commercials on Indian television urge parents
					to get their young daughters inoculated with the vaccine
					to protect against cervical cancer which is caused by the
					human papilloma virus (HPV). But they fail to emphasise key
					information, and they also create panic.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is also under wraps is that the vaccine has been mired in
					controversy in the US since its launch in 2006. The controversy
					is over its potential side effects, its efficacy and the ethics
					of administering it to girls as young as nine years of age.
					According to medical ethicists, advertising prescription drugs
					on television is unethical enough, but using fear to sell them is
					worse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Key information about the safety and risk profiles has not
					been made available to parents. Reported"serious" side effects
					include seizures, blood clots, and paralysis. Less serious side
					effects include fainting, fever and headaches. However, US
					health officials and Merck have dismissed the adverse events as"unrelated to the vaccine".
				</p>
				<p>
					Another ethical issue raised is that the vaccine can only prevent,
					but not treat, HPV infection. Since HPV is sexually transmitted,
					the vaccine needs to be given before a girl becomes sexually
					active -- ideally at the age of 11. This has led some to suggest
					that it might encourage sexual promiscuity post vaccination.
				</p>
				<p>
					With many unanswered questions, critics say that the Indian
					health ministry acted in haste to put the Merck vaccine in
					chemist shops before the results of clinical trials on Indian
					women (16-23 years) were published. If it was really serious
					about tackling cervical cancer it should have, instead, promoted
					the inexpensive Pap test, a screening test that costs Rs 200. The
					vaccine is exorbitantly priced for the Indian market at Rs 5,800.
				</p>
				<p>
					The vaccine's long-lasting effectiveness is unclear, as no clinical
					trial participants have been followed for more than five years.
					And it does not protect against 30 per cent of HPV strains. This
					means that even vaccinated women should continue screening
					by regular Pap tests.

				<h4>Drug approved despite violation of Indian drug laws</h4>
				<p>
					Questions are being asked about a clinical trial of a cancer drug
					that led to the drug's approval for infertility treatment in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Letrozole is approved for breast cancer treatment in postmenopausal
					women in 30 countries. Until recently, it was
					not approved for fertility treatment anywhere in the world.
					However, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) recently
					gave it marketing approval for fertility treatment in premenopausal
					women.
				</p>
				<p>
					The DCGI is reported to have disregarded warnings by the
					original manufacturer, Novartis, about the unsuitability of
					letrozole for infertility treatment in pre-menopausal women.
					According to CM Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical
					Specialities India, the DCGI also ignored rules governing safety
					of clinical trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Letrozole first created a controversy in India five years ago. The
					Indian drug company Sun Pharmaceuticals was promoting
					letrozole with infertility specialists, despite the fact that it is
					illegal to promote a drug's use for an unapproved condition.
					Reports from these doctors were then used by the company to
					encourage the off-label use of the drug.
				</p>
				<p>
					When a <em>MIMS</em> report on this practice caused a nationwide
					uproar, Sun Pharma found a way to get the drug approved by
					conducting a clinical trial of sorts. This"phase 3 trial" had only
					55 participants, though a minimum of 100 are required for
					phase 3 trials. Further, phase 3 trials of an approved drug for
					a new indication must be preceded by phase 1 and phase 2
					trials, for the same indication, that establish the drug's safety in
					healthy pre-menopausal women and the dose for treatment.
					The trial protocol papers do not provide such evidence and the
					permission is therefore flagrant violation of Indian drug laws,
					according to Dr. Gulhati.

				<h4>Kerala debates euthanasia</h4>
				<p>
					A law commission in Kerala has recommended the legalisation
					of euthanasia and assisted suicide as part of the Kerala
					Terminally Ill Patients Act. The commission has argued that
					terminally ill patients should have the right to consider
					euthanasia after taking responsible medical opinion on the
					prognosis of the illness and the scope for a normal, pain-free
					life. The commission also wants to delete Section 309 of the
					Indian Penal Code which makes suicide an offence.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the proposal runs counter to a host of Supreme
					Court rulings that have declared euthanasia or mercy killings
					homicide, irrespective of the circumstances under which they
					take place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should it be approved, the proposed law would allow
					terminally ill persons to put an end to their life under medical
					supervision and also give competent patients the right to
					refuse treatment, including breathing machines. If patients are
					incapable of making an informed decision, or have not taken an informed decision, medical practitioners can evaluate what
					treatment to offer, or decide to withhold it altogether.

				<h4>Indian doctor pursues unproven stem cell treatment</h4>
				<p>
					Leading Australian scientists have issued warnings about the
					growth of stem cell tourism in India. An Indian doctor speaking
					at a fund-raiser in Australia reported developing embryonic
					stem cell lines and using them to treat people with conditions
					including spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's and motor neurone
					disease. The doctor claimed that the therapy was safe and
					reported that it had resulted in improved movement and
					sensation in limbs in a number of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Critics have stated that use of human embryonic stem cells
					for such purposes has not been properly tested, and there is
					no evidence of the procedure's effectiveness and safety. Such
					practices are dangerous and irresponsible. The doctor's methods
					need to be subjected to independent scientific scrutiny.

				<h4>Tobacco industry puts pressure on the government</h4>
				<p>
					The government has succumbed to pressure from the tobacco
					industry to tone down its plans for pictorial warnings on
					tobacco products. This information was obtained by an NGO
					under the Right to Information Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pictorial warnings on tobacco products are intended to
					increase consumer knowledge of the deadly health effects of
					tobacco consumption and to encourage people to stop using
					tobacco. Pictorial warnings also reach across linguistic and
					cultural barriers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The central government admits that it is under pressure, not
					only from the bidi industry, but also from other interested
					parties. The government stated that the group of ministers
					entrusted with the responsibility has recommended
					weaker pictorial warnings on tobacco products. Further, the
					implementation of this programme has been postponed to
					May 2009-by when parliamentary elections will be over.

				<h4>Insurance coverage refused to visually impaired</h4>

					Insurance companies are refusing coverage to the disabled.
					An ex-bank employee who lost his eyesight after an accident
					approached Reliance General Insurance officials for an
					insurance policy. He was told that the company had no
					provision to give insurance cover to visually challenged people.
					He then went to the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation.
					LIC rejected his papers as well. He then went to New Delhi and
					called on the chief commissioner for persons with disability
					(Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment) to complain
					about LIC's refusal. He has lodged a case against LIC, calling on
					them to abide by the Persons With Disabilities Act 1995 which
					does not allow for discrimination against visually challenged
					persons. He has also called on the Centre to delegate more
					powers to authorities to execute the provisions of the PWD Act,
					both in the public and the private sector.

				<h4>India uses controversial brain scan to convict</h4>

					independent study or peer-reviewed.

					A women accused of poisoning her former fianc&#233; with arsenic
					was subjected to the Brain Electrical Oscillations Signature test,
					developed by an Indian neuroscientist. When details of the

				<h4>TV broadcast of assisted suicide in Britain</h4>
				<p>
					It is illegal in Britain to aid, abet, counsel or procure suicide. Only
					a handful of places, including Switzerland, the Netherlands, and
					some states in the US, allow assisted suicide, and only according
					to stringent criteria. In the last decade, about 100 Britons have
					committed suicide at a Swiss clinic called Dignitas, whose slogan
					is"Die with dignity". The clinic has been accused of profiting in
					assisting people die.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently a man chose have his death broadcasted on Sky
					Television, in the film,"Right to die!" supported by Digitas. It is said
					to be the first broadcast on British television of the moment of
					death in a case of voluntary euthanasia.
				</p>
				<p>
					This incident added fuel to an already contentious debate.
					But while the law is clear, its application is murky. Authorities
					periodically prosecute people who have assisted in suicides
					in Britain. They are rarely sent to jail, but face many months
					of distress while waiting to stand trial. Parliament has been
					reluctant to reconsider its position, and Prime Minister Gordon
					Brown said that he opposed legislation that would allow assisted
					suicide.

					with severe penalties. Transplant tourism is also being tackled.

					The Ministry of Health is also trying to set up an opt-in system

				<h4>Unreliable diagnostic tests sold in developing
				countries</h4>
				<p>
					An inquiry has found that many tuberculosis tests being sold in
					developing countries were missing more cases than they found.
					The evaluation of 19 commercially available rapid diagnostic
					tests, which detect antibodies to tuberculosis bacteria, found
					that on average they could identify only about a quarter of
					cases. Most detected less than half and one test identified
					less than one in a 100 cases. This means that 99 out of 100 TBinfected
					people would continue to go about their daily lives
					coughing and infecting people, according to a report by the
					WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical
					Diseases which conducted the research.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem is particularly acute in the case of rapid diagnostic
					tests which have been hailed as the solution to providing
					affordable and timely point-of-care diagnosis in developing
					countries. While certain rapid tests on the market are effective,
					many others do not work effectively or reliably, leaving people
					with undiagnosed conditions or infections that could be lifethreatening.
					Unfortunately, very few countries actually look at
					the quality of the products before they are allowed to go on
					sale.
				</p>
				<p>
					Experts have called for a global body to regulate diagnostic
					tests, particularly those used in the control of diseases that
					disproportionately affect developing countries. Such a body
					should set standards for tests, provide guidelines for their
					evaluation, ensure that participating manufacturers adhere to
					a code of conduct and provide a"seal of approval" for quality
					products.
