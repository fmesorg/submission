				<h4>FMES activities: some highlights</h4>
				<h5>The General Body Meeting of the Forum for Medical
				Ethics Society was held on September 2, 2001.</h5>
				<p>
					Some of the subjects discussed were: our subscription
					base, themes for future issues, and other projects for the
					organisation. We need to do a systematic analysis of
					who subscribes to IME, who renews and who doesn't.
					Our current strategy for increasing subscription
					includes a small number of complimentary
					subscriptions in the hope that they will eventually
					subscribe. We also depend on the enthusiasm of our
					members. Some themes for future issues: medical ethics
					in general practice; violence by, and against, doctors;
					the cut practice: a debate; medical records; the
					influence of managed care, and guidelines for
					interaction between the pharmaceutical and medical
					supplies industries and the medical profession. Among
					future projects are: organising meetings with our
					contacts, and an anthology of the last nine years of the
					journal. We also hope to have regular quarterly
					meetings for discussions on current issues relating to
					medical ethics.

				<h5>Discussion on the proposed Maharashtra Clinical Establishments Act was held on October 28, 2001.</h5>
				<p>
					The discussion included both members of the FMES and
					others concerned with the subject. The MCEA is a
					proposed revision to the Bombay Nursing Homes
					Registration Act. Current revisions are the consequence
					of an earlier campaign in relation to a case of medical
					negligence in a private hospital. FMES was one of the
					organisations represented at a workshop on the MCEA,
					organised on behalf of the Maharashtra Health Systems
					Project. The MCEA is considered important because it
					will affect all aspects of medical practice. One question
					is: will it be an effective tool to make the private sector
					more accountable?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Future plans:</strong> In September, we also held two
					workshops, which were mentioned in the last
					activities report. The April 2002 issue should carry
					these workshop reports in more detail. FMES is
					regularly being approached to organise such
					workshops, on various aspects of medical ethics. The
					next one, in collaboration with the Kerala Health
					Studies and Research Centre in Trivandrum, will be on
					research ethics, to be held in late January 2002.
				</p>
				<p>
					The last few months have also been a time for laying
					down the foundation for future work. It is becoming
					clear that the organisation will need funds in order to
					grow further, whether in terms of IME's subscription
					base, or the quality of the journal, or other activities
					such as bringing out other publications, reaching out
					to a larger readership, developing our site and
					interacting with the medical/health community within
					India, as well as in elsewhere in the world. In the last
					two months, we have made tentative steps for such fundraising,
					and will report in more detail as these progress.
					We also hope to carry a discussion on plans for the
					organisation, and funding these plan, in a future issue
					of the journal.
