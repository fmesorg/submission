					Some large hospitals in Bombay insist that every patient seeking  investigation or treatment should undergo tests to check for Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV).
				</p>
				<p>
					This is done on the following grounds: (1.) In view of the known  spread of this disease, it is essential to test every one presenting at the  hospital for the patient's own safety. If the test for HIV is positive,  appropriate measures can be instituted in an attempt at preventing the  development of AIDS. (2.) Hospital personnel must be protected against this  disease which, at present, has no known therapy against it. This can only be  done if each and every patient is tested. (3.) The data collected will  facilitate epidemiological studies. <h4>Problems posed by such  insistence</h4>
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						All patients are forced to undergo a test, not performed gratis  by the hospital, irrespective of their willingness to do so. There is, thus, an  abrogation of the right of the patient to choose. The hospitals argue that an  unwilling patient is free to seek investigation or therapy elsewhere. This, in  effect, deprives the patient of his right to choose where he will seek advice  and treatment.
					</li>
					<li>
						No clear guideline exists on disclosure of the report when it  is positive for HIV. The assumption that it will remain confidential is not  borne out by the facts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Should the test for HIV be positive, the patient and his family  are ostracised by the hospital, doctors, nurses, other staff and society at  large. In a recent instance in Bombay, a middle aged man, who tested positive  for HIV, was accused by his own children of having indulged in promiscuous  sexual intercourse out of wedlock. Untold agony followed till it was shown that  he had probably contracted the disease from his wife who had been given  contaminated blood as transfusions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Should We, using the same principle, not test all patients for  each of the variants of the hepatitis virus, the acid fast bacilli causing tuberculosis  and leprosy, Treponema pallidum and other such infections?
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>A plea for sanity</h4>
				<p>
					Our collective behaviour at present resembles that in the recent  past against persons with leprosy, tuberculosis and the venereal diseases. The  almost hysterical attitudes adopted by individuals and groups who should know  better against the person testing positive for HIV need imniediate correction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Theres can be no argument against taking reasonable precautions to  prevent transmission of AIDS from the patient to anyone else - doctor, nurse,  other attendant, relatives or society at large. Simple, common sense measures  against contamination are adequate. The virus is easily killed by a number of  methods of sterilisation. Such as autoclaving and the use of disinfectants.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is, however, no excuse for treating the patient as a pariah.  This is against the ethos of a doctor.
