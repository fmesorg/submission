				<p>
					I swear by Apollo the  physician, by Asclepius, by Health, by Panacea and by all the gods and  goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my  ability and Judgment, this oath and this indenture; to hold my teacher in this  art equal to my own parents: to make him partner in my livelihood; when he is  in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his family as my own  brothers and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it, without fee or  indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other instruction to my  own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured pupils who have taken the  physician's oath, but to nobody else. I will use treatment to help the sick  according to my ability and judgment, but never with a view to injury and  wrong-doing. Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do  so, nor will I suggest such a course. Simliariy, I will not give a woman a  pesssary to cause abortion. But I will keep pure and holy both in my life and  art. I will not use the knife, not even verily, on sufferers from stone but I  will give place to such as are craftsmen therein. Into whatsoever houses I  enter, I will enter to help the sick, and I will abstain horn all intentional  wrong-doing and harm, especially from abusing the bodies of man and woman,  bond or free. And whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my  proffession as well as outside my professsion In my Intercourse with men,if it  be what should not be published abroad, I will never divulge holding such  things to be holy secret. Now if I carry out this oath, and break It not, may I  gain for ever reputation among all men for my life and for my art; but if I  transgress If and forswear myself may the opposite befall me.
