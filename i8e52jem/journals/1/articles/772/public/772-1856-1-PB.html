					The  race for the launch of new drugs, brands and combination drugs has resulted in  nearly 50&ndash;80 new entries in the market in the year 2002 alone. Is it 'healthy'  to have such a flooding of the market with new drugs? Do these new drugs really  have benefits over their older congeners as most of them claim to have? To  answer these questions, we need to look at two important aspects in the field  of new drug marketing: safety and claims of superiority.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Safety  of new drugs</h4>
				<p>
					The  health sector is faced with the issue of safety of all new drugs. In the  present system, before a new drug is introduced into the market, it is  mandatory to go through different stages of laboratory and clinical trials.  These are aimed at establishment of therapeutic efficacy as well as the safety  profile of the new drug. The various phases of the clinical trial are <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Laurence DR and Bennet PN. Clinical Pharmacology. 7th ed. Edinburg,UK: Churchill Livingstone, 1997:42." id="1">(1)</a>:
				</p>
				<p>
					Phase I  trials test the drug on a sample of 25&ndash;50 healthy volunteers to establish its  safety. Phase II trials test 50&ndash;300 patients for the drug's therapeutic effect.  In Phase III trials, between 250 and 1,000 patients participate in a randomized  clinical trial comparing the drug with a placebo to confirm the drug's  efficacy. Phase IV 'trials' are post-marketing surveillance of the drug's  safety in the general population and can cover between 2,000 and 10,000 people.
				</p>
				<p>
					From  these figures, one can see that the number of people actually exposed to the  drug in the first three phases are few (a maximum of 1,350). If there are no  serious adverse effects at this point, the drug is approved for marketing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is a  number of 1,350 enough to detect a rare adverse effect? Let us examine this  issue by looking at the following situation: In a case where the adverse drug  reaction to a particular drug has an incidence of 1 in 1,000 (occurs in 1  patient out of 1,000 treated), we would need to screen a minimum number of  3,600 patients for the confirmation of its absence <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ferner RE, Hazards, risks and reality. Br J Clin Pharmacol 1992;33:125&ndash;8." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As  3,600 people are usually not involved in the first three phases of a clinical  trial, it is possible that a drug with a rare but fatal adverse reaction could  be used by the general population. The process of monitoring for safety should  thus continue. This monitoring is done in Phase IV, termed as 'post-marketing  surveillance'. The spectrum of adverse effects of any drug range from the  common (detected during these trials and documented), to the rare (unidentified  in early studies and yet important). It is these rare side-effects, usually  undocumented in trial settings, which may subsequently have serious  consequences for the population taking that drug. This makes the post-marketing  surveillance an even more important tool to get the entire spectrum of the  drug's activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  takes some time before such large numbers of patients get treated and observed.  Thus, we see a delay of many years before such significant reactions are  reported. The risk of 1 in 1,000 went undetected for 3&ndash;7 years in the following  instances: pulmonary embolism due to oral contraceptives, halothane-induced  jaundice, lincomycin-induced colitis <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ferner RE, Hazards, risks and reality. Br J Clin Pharmacol 1992;33:125&ndash;8." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In many  occasions, the incidence of a potentially fatal adverse reaction may be smaller  than this. This therefore means that it may be even more difficult to detect  them in the population and would need a larger number of patients on the drug,  and a more intensive surveillance programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are a few other issues to be highlighted regarding post-marketing surveillance.  The first issue, that of who conducts the surveillance and who are the  subjects, is an important one with respect to its credibility. In most of the  cases, these are conducted by pharmaceutical companies, and therefore the issue  of potential bias comes into play. The other aspect is that the surveillance  done in western countries for adverse effects is often extrapolated to the  Indian population. Considering the genetic differences as well as diet and  nutrition, the extrapolation of such reports may not give the true picture in  the Indian setting.
				</p>

				<h4>Claims  of superiority</h4>
				<p>
					Post-marketing  surveillance is not only about reporting adverse effects. It is also done to  see the performance of these drugs as compared to the existing ones. Often,  doctors are exposed to various claims of pharmaceutical companies that their  drug is 'superior' to existing drugs, with the standard phrase being 'the  initial results are very promising'. Hence, it is essential to consider the  factors affecting the feedback from the case reports of patients receiving any  new drug. One of the most important factors emerges when post-marketing  surveillance is subject to an effect called the Weber Effect <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO international drug monitoring: cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. WHO Drug Information 2002;16:8&ndash;11." id="3">(3)</a>. This  phenomenon, first described by Dr Peter Weber, denotes the combined effects of  rapid increase in the use of, and interest in, a new drug, leading to a high  rate of reporting. However, comparisons with older drugs with stable reporting  can be misleading. Therefore, both the general over-reporting, for the new  drug, combined with the Weber Effect, should be considered when comparing new  drugs with drugs already existing in the market.
				</p>

				<h4>A  possible solution</h4>
				<p>
					In the  Indian scenario, general practitioners, with an outpatient base and limited  facilities for adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring tend to be among the  first ones to use these 'latest' drugs. Even the patients seem to prefer these  'new' drugs for their treatment without realising the risk that they are  putting themselves through.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  solution to most of the above problems associated with the use of new drugs can  be derived from the example of the policies of the Japanese health ministry <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Postmarketing system to be revised. WHO Drug Information 1999;13:240." id="4">(4)</a>. In their set-up, the pharmaceutical companies are required to provide  their product to a limited number of medical institutions for a period of three  months following the launch of a product and conduct focused post-marketing  surveillance. After inspection of the results of this surveillance, the  companies are then allowed to expand the number of medical institutions using  the product. Requiring companies to limit sales to a small number of medical  institutions and collecting information in this way makes it easier to respond  to adverse drug reactions of newly approved products. It needs to be examined  whether this practice can be transcribed to the Indian situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  imperative that the drug control authorities and other governmental agencies  strengthen the post-marketing surveillance programme in India. They need to  look at ways of minimising risk to the population due to rare adverse events  when new drugs are introduced into the market. Any doctor or hospital, when  deciding on the use of a new drug, should objectively compare it to the  existing drugs. A balanced judgement needs to be made without blindly following  the tall claims of superiority made by drug manufacturers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  conclusion, an awareness of the importance of post-marketing surveillance is  the need of the hour, at all levels, whether it be the government, the health  professional or the patient. An official surveillance programme needs to be  initiated and subsequently evaluated. Till then the question remains, 'Are all  new drugs 'healthy'?'
