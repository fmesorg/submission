					The  case presents the problems grappled with during a study done as part of  post-graduate thesis work during 2000-2001 among certain tribal communities in  north-central India, and the way they were resolved at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This  sero-epidemiological study was done to estimate the point prevalence of  kala-azar infection in a certain tribe in north-central India. The study was  undertaken because of the high morbidity and mortality due to kala-azar, a  vector-borne disease, among this fast dwindling community. The tribe has  minimum contact with the outside world. Fewer than two per cent are literate.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  study required three drops of blood from the study participants, using the  finger prick method, for the direct agglutination test and the intradermal  leishmanin skin test. In addition, baseline information and patient histories  were to be gathered through individual interviews. Participants were  chosen by systematic random sampling from a population of 9,020. Four padas  (tribal hamlets) were chosen and 182 blood samples were collected for the  study.

				<h4>Seeking  informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					Based on our understanding of the community organisation, we first approached  community leaders in each pada to explain who we were and the purpose of our  study, and to ask for their cooperation in carrying out the study. Then, in  consultation with the community leaders, we scheduled meetings for the next  day. The community leaders sent a local person to prospective participants,  along with our translator, to inform them of the venue and time of the  scheduled meeting. Prospective participants were not informed of the  agenda of the meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					During  the community meetings&mdash;which included other members of the community as they  were held in open public spaces&mdash;the community leader introduced the research  team, namely, the technician who served as the translator, and myself. We then  explained the purpose of the study, and also spoke on topics such as kala-azar,  its manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and vector control. We did not use any  visual media. The technician, who was not familiar with the subject matter,  translated my explanations on the spot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Informed  consent was sought after the meeting got over and before potential participants  were asked to give blood. Following this, individuals were asked to undergo the  finger-prick test, followed by a short (four to five minutes) interview. We  collected information on demographic variables and a brief medical history.  Both tests and interviews were conducted at the place of the meeting. We found  this logistically convenient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Informed  consent forms, prepared in the vernacular, contained information on the purpose  of the study and the possible risks. Since the community was illiterate and  spoke a language unfamiliar to us, we deliberated for some time on the  appropriate method of seeking informed consent. The idea of asking for written  consent&mdash;with signatures or thumb impressions&mdash;was dropped; these are associated  with giving away land rights or signing promissory notes. The following  alternatives were considered:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Codes:</strong> These could be colours, with green representing acceptance and red refusal to  participate in the study, or markings, with a 'tick mark' for agreement and a  cross for refusal. However, the significance of such codes was alien to this  community. <strong>Audio recorded consent</strong> seemed appropriate, but we could not afford  this. We also considered <strong>community consent</strong> of the village head. Another option  was to explain the purpose of the study to the community representative, who  would then discuss it with the community and convey the community's decision to  us. We considered this the most appropriate alternative since this is the way  the community functions traditionally. Community leaders' decisions are binding  on the community as a whole, contrary to modern value systems premised on  individual autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Community consent had an additional appeal; it would mean a phenomenal saving  of time and energy to be invested in translating the consent form, and  explaining it to every prospective research participant. However, our  ethics advisors did not approve of substituting individual consent by community  consent on the grounds that it potentially compromised the autonomous character  of informed consent.
				</p>

				<h4>Some  ethical questions</h4>
				<p>
					Should we thrust, on tribal communities, a value system premised on  'individualism' which potentially could disregard their 'communitarian' value  system? Is it not advisable to design methodologies that accommodate the  socio-cultural practices of the communities being researched? Are we not  overriding the authority of the village head by approaching individual  community members for their consent, when they indicate that the village head's  decision is more important than their own? Should researchers tamper with the  value system of the tribal community to meet their own requirements?
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally,  is providing appropriate treatment to everyone in the community inflicted with  the illness under study an ethical obligation or an inducement?
				</p>
				<p>
					We  expected to come across people in the community with kala-azar who required  health care attention. We were guided on this by the Indian Council of Medical  Research guidelines which state: '.... it is generally considered unethical to  withhold (an) intervention or services' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects. New Delhi: ICMR, 2000:45." id="1">(1)</a>. This guideline indicates that  cases identified during the study should be referred to an appropriate health  care institution, especially if the treatment involved is expensive. Our ethics  consultants recommended abiding by this guideline strictly, as the community  was cut off from health care facilities. So we referred cases of malaria and  kala-azar, detected during the screening, for medical examination and care, and  also bore the expenses. We did the same for those who were not research  participants. By doing so, we won the confidence of the community in general  and study participants in particular. As a result, prospective research  participants also expressed their consent to participate by giving their thumb  impression on the informed consent form, and some younger, literate  participants signed the consent forms.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  fact, providing treatment changed the community's attitude to the study, and  its willingness to give written informed consent. This left us asking: How do  we balance the conflict between the ethical responsibility to attend to the  community's health care needs and the need to avoid inducement to ensure  individuals' autonomous voluntary participation?
