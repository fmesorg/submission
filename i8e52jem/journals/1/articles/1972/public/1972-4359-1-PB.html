				<h4>Modern medical practice</h4>
				<p>
					Abusive modem medical practice
					<br />
					Creates scares about allergies,
					<br />
					osteoporosis,
					<br />
					Cancer, high cholesterol and diabetes.
				</p>

				<p>
					And blows diseases out of all proportion.
					<br />
					People are stampeded into check-ups and monthly tests,
					<br />
					Boosted by sales personnel and advertisers,
					<br />
					Who promote hospitals and 'services',
					<br />
					So that well or ill,
					<br />
					people are subjected to tests.
				</p>

				<p>
					Tests often reveal 'disorders' that cause no disease,
					<br />
					Causmg anxiety on the need for 'intervention',
					<br />
					Converting asymptomatic persons into patients
					<br />
					To whom the doctor now prescribes expensive treatment.
				</p>

				<p>
					Care providers get commissions and bonus,
					<br />
					Good for specialists, laboratories
					<br />
					Pharmacies and lawyers.
					<br />
					Gut not for the patient whose woes worsen
				</p>

				<p>
					Doctors' ineptitude arises,
					<br />
					as they treat trivial complaints by complex means,
					<br />
					Producing doctor-made diseases
					<br />
					cryptically termed iatrogenic.
				</p>

				<p>
					As superfluous tests disturb health and peace of mind,
					<br />
					Superstitions, phobias and socio-cultural influences
					<br />
					Lead to change of physicians,
					<br />
					Pushing many to alternative medical systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is there a cure?
					<br />
					Mushrooming nursing homes and diagnostic laboratories
					<br />
					Must be subject to quality control and national norms.
					<br />
					Health care delivery must be delinked from profiteering.
				</p>

				<p>
					Professionals must bc made to apply medical ethics,
					<br />
					The public must acquire health awareness,
					<br />
					Seek education for healthy living,
					<br />
					And modify life-style to prevent and promote health.
