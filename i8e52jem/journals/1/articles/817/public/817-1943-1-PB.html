					Societal  support to the death penalty in India was high during the public debate  preceding the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee in Kolkata. Community hysteria  was such that some youngsters died in mock re-enactments of the hanging, and  the hangman acquired the status of a celebrity. The support base for the death  penalty has only expanded over the years, with increasing violence&mdash;sponsored by  both civil society and the state. This cuts across political parties and  ideologies, emboldening the judiciary, law-makers and constitutional heads to  use it more often.

				<p>
					In  1980, in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, the Supreme Court, by a four-to-one  majority ruled that the death penalty was constitutionally valid and did not  constitute an 'unreasonable, cruel or unusual punishment'. It should be kept in  mind that the terms 'unreasonable, cruel or unusual punishment' and 'rarest of  rare case' are defined not by objective criteria but subjectively by judges who  are influenced by public opinion. This is also true in the USA <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Annas G. Moral progress, mental retardation and death penalty.

				<h4>Medical  involvement in the death penalty</h4>
				<p>
					In the  past decade, the law and judiciary have made systematic efforts to promote  doctors' participation in the death penalty. In 1995, a two-judge bench of the  Supreme Court decided on a petition opposing the stipulation in the Punjab Jail  Manual that, after execution, the body of an executed person be kept hanging  for half an hour. The petitioner also demanded that instead of hanging,  potassium cyanide should be used for execution. The Court did not accept the  second demand, but agreed that keeping the body hanging for half an hour was  barbarous and ruled that 'A convict shall remain hanging only till he is  declared dead by the medical officer.' As a result of this little-known  judgment, a doctor must periodically examine the person after the hanging, to  look for signs of life. If the person is found alive, the doctor is to ask the  hangman to continue&mdash;to order hanging to kill instead of resuscitating <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A, Vadair A. The doctor's dilemma: a Supreme Court judgment on death by hanging violates medical ethics. Humanscape March 1995;12-13." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further  medicalisation of execution was suggested in 2003, when the Law Commission of  India in its 187th report recommended the use of a lethal injection <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Law Commission of India. Consultation paper on mode of execution of death sentence and incidental matters, 2003. Available from URL: http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/187th%20report.pdf(accessed on September 22, 2004)." id="3">(3)</a>. It is  a matter of time before the Supreme Court decides&mdash;or Parliament enacts a law&mdash;that hanging is barbarous, cruel and unusual, and should be replaced by a  lethal injection. The use of a lethal injection is unique because it simulates  the medical procedure; the setting of the execution looks medical, and due to  the condition of the prisoner it often needs a doctor's assistance to carry  out.

					Historically,  medical professionals have played an active role in designing execution methods  and in helping make existing methods more efficient. In the eighteenth century,  Dr Antoine Louis designed and Dr Joseph-Ignac Guillotine advocated the  decapitating machine as a humane method of execution that became infamous as  the guillotine. Dr Alfred Southwick, a dentist, helped design the electric  chair that was considered 'more humane' for many years. Medical expertise  played an important role in the use of the gas chamber and even in hanging. Dr  Stanley Deutsch, an anaesthesiologist, conceived of a lethal injection along  the lines of intravenous induction of general anaesthesia. The first 'clinical  trial' of the lethal injection was carried out in Texas in 1982 on a  40-year-old African-American man who was injected with anaesthetic agents as  two doctors watched. He was dead within minutes <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Groner JI. Lethal injection: a stain on the face of medicine. BMJ 2002;325:1026-8." id="4">(4)</a>.

					In the  process of an execution, doctors are involved in the care of prisoners awaiting  execution, in preparations such as certifying fitness, procuring chemicals for  lethal injection, sedating the prisoner on the day of execution, advising on or  participating in the execution itself, pronouncing death, certifying death,  removing organs for transplantation, and carrying out an autopsy. Psychiatrists  carry out evaluations of the prisoner's mental state, provide testimony in  capital cases (including 'fitness for execution' determinations) and give or  recommend treatment. Other health professionals may be asked to carry out  doctors' roles when doctors refuse to participate.

				<h4>Doctors  oppose medical participation</h4>
				<p>
					In  1980, the American Medical Association (AMA) and in 1981, the World Medical  Association strongly opposed medical participation in the death penalty. Most  other national and international associations of medical and other health  professionals also forbid participation of their members. In 1992, the AMA came  out with detailed guidelines on medical acts in the process of execution that  do or do not violate medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, American Medical Association. Physician participation in capital punishment. JAMA 1993;270:365-8." id="5">(5)</a>. Accordingly, testifying on competence  to stand trial, testifying on relevant medical issues during a trial,  testifying during the penalty phase of the trial, witnessing an execution in a  non-professional capacity, relieving acute suffering of the condemned and  certifying death after someone else has already verified the death, are  considered within the framework of ethical conduct. On the other hand,  prescribing or administering tranquillisers or other drugs that are part of the  execution procedure, monitoring vital signs, attending or observing the  execution as a physician, selecting sites for injecting, starting intravenous  lines to administer lethal chemicals, prescribing or administering the drugs,  supervising lethal injection devices or personnel and pronouncing death  (examining the executed person to ascertain life) are considered unethical.
				</p>
				<p>
					The AMA  guidelines, however, do not deal with issues such as providing evidence bearing  on competence to be executed, treating incompetent prisoners to restore  competence to allow execution, and issues relating to transplantation of organs  following execution. Ethical problems in these areas are acute and fiercely  debated. Interestingly, though the AMA adopted an anti-death penalty resolution  in 1969, it subsequently remained silent on issues other than regulating  doctors' participation. Medical associations from Europe, with the lead  provided by the British Medical Association, consistently opposed the death  penalty and played a key role in ensuring that it was taken off the law books  of most European countries.

				<h4>Ethical  challenges for health professionals in India</h4>
				<p>
					The  1995 Supreme Court judgment and the Law Commission's report (2003) pose major  ethical challenges for health professionals in India. The 1995 court ruling  demanding that a medical officer monitor vital signs while the person is  hanging severely compromises medical ethics and must be opposed by the  profession. Involving medical professionals in the death penalty, or demanding  that psychiatrists should treat mentally ill persons to make them fit for  execution, puts law and medical ethics on a head-on collision. The ethics  movement must educate the judiciary and law-makers on the subject. Finally, the  Law Commission's recommendation on lethal injection should be firmly opposed as  it tries to give a medical face to an inhuman punishment. Doctors, who occupy a  more powerful position in the medical hierarchy, must support other health  professionals, such as nurses and technicians, forced by administrative orders  to participate in executions.
