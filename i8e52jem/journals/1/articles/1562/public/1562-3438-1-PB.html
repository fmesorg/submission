				<h4>Governmental action  only after catastrophy has struck</h4>
				<p>
					A patient died in a reputed private allopathic hospital in Mumbai due to a  wrong blood type administered during transfusion by an homeopathic doctor. This  death led to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) being filed in the Bombay High  Court raising issues with regard to the quality of care provided by private  hospitals, the type of staff employed, regulation and monitoring systems and  the role of regulating bodies.
				</p>

				<h4>Private hospitals  neither monitored nor regulated</h4>
				<p>
					Till recently only the states of Maharashtra and Delhi had an act for  monitoring private hospitals. Due to the pressure brought by various consumer  organisations, the states of Tamil Nadu and Bihar are in the process of  enacting a legislation. There is opposition by hospital owners and medical  associations of the particular states to the proposed legisration (See item 21  in Vox Populi).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a sad fact that where legislation is  already in place, it is not being implemented. It took a PIL to awaken the authorities  to implement the provision of the act. The chief justice of the Bombay High  Court remarked: "The writ petition has served the purpose of activising the  concerned authorities who seem to have woken up and taken certain steps in the  direction of implementation of the various provisions of the law.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					The Bombay Nursing Home Act of 1949 is quite  inadequate in its various provisions. The act is only meant for registration of  the private hospital. It does not cover minimum standards to be maintained with  regard to space, facilities, staff employed, sanitary conditions, equipment and  other supportive services. It is quite surprising and disgraceful that after  fifty years of independence, private hospitals and nursing homes are  functioning practically unregulated and, when regulation is being brought in,  it is being opposed by vested interests who do not want to be accountable.
				</p>
				<p>
					This unregulated and unaccountable nature of  private hospitals has led to various problems in the delivery of health care.  The quality of care provided varies wildly from one such hospital to another.  In many cases, there is a lot to be desired.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Statistics on private  hospitals not available</h4>
				<p>
					The Government of India and those in the states do not have reliable  information on the number of private hospitals functioning in the country.  According to Health Information of India, 1992, brought out by the Central  Bureau of Health Intelligence, Ministry of Health, Government of India, there  were only 1,319 private hospitals in Maharashtra. But the Bombay Municipal  Corporation, alone, declared the presence of 907 private hospitals in Mumbai  when questioned by the court during the PIL referred to above. Even this figure  from Mumbai is an underestimate.
				</p>
				<p>
					If one was to seek from authorities  information on hospitals by sizes (small nursing homes, medium sized nursing  homes, small hospitals, large hospitals, private teaching hospitals); details  on staff and equipment in each; types of cases treated; diagnosis; type of  treatment provided; outcome of treatment; mortality figures and statistical  analysis of medical data from each hospital one would face incredulous, blank  visages. Such data is just not available. Worse, since no records are  maintained by many of these hospitals, there is no way anyone can ever get such  information!
				</p>
				<p>
					Only in the recent past have attempts been  made by researchers and the media to study various aspects of the functioning  of private hospitals. These studies have shown a variety of unpleasant facts on  the functioning of private hospitals.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Some perturbing  findings</h4>
				<p>
					A large majoritv of the private hospitals in the country have less than thirty  beds and most of them are run by individual proprietors. The number of  hospitals which are run by entrepreneurs and corporate houses who appoint  doctors and other staff to run the hospital is relatively small.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a misconception being perpetuated  that private hospitals provide care of good quality. This is not supported by  facts. The findings of the various studies conducted on private hospitals show  that the condition of many of the private hospitals and the quality of care  provided leave a lot to be desired. This is a consequence of the fact that they  are not regulated and monitored.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the premier city of Mumbai, a study showed  that 62.5% of the hospitals were located in residential premises and 12.5% were  in sheds which had roofs of asbestos or tin. Of the twenty-two hospitals that  were supposed to have operation theatre facilities, only fifteen had a  designated area for this purpose. In seven hospitals the operation theatre was  also used as the labour room. In many hospitals, the operation theatres were  located in the kitchen of the flat, with leakages through their roofs and paint  peeling off their walls. In one instance, the operation theatre was located  below a toilet block and fluid from the toilet was leaking through the roof  into the area where operations were being performed! Seventy-five percent of  the hospitals did not have separate scrubbing and sterilising rooms. Many  hospitals were not equipped to handle emergencies and did not have supportive  services such as generators.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most private hospitals function with  unqualified and inadequate staff. In another study thirty-nine percent of the  hospitals were functioning without either a full-time doctor or a visiting  consultant. 29.6 % of hospitals were run by non-allopaths but these doctors  prescribed allopathic drugs. In 10% of cases, these doctors functioned in  isolation. Patients in intensive cardiac units are left to the mercies of  homeopaths or ayurveds. In one case a non-allopathic doctor also performed  surgical operations using allopathic techniques and drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only three qualified nurses could be found in  the entire sample of fifty hospitals studied. Many doctors boast of the fact  that they have trained the 'nurses' who were also assisting them in the  operation theatres. When asked why these nurses are not certified by the  Nursing Council to ensure adequate training, these doctors remain silent.
				</p>
				<p>
					With regard to equipment and instruments, too,  private hospitals were found to cut corners. An oxygen cylinder was available  in only half of hospitals claiming to be providing obstetric and gynaecology  services. A labour table was available in only three-fourths, and a suction  machine in eight out of ten of them.
				</p>
				<p>
					With regard to surgical services, only a third  of the hospitals studied had an X-ray machine, half had an oxygen cylinder and  a third possessed an electrocautery unit. None of the hospitals had a Boyle's  apparatus for conducting general anaesthesia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sanitary conditions in private hospitals  are also appalling. In both the studies quoted above, the hospitals were seen  to be congested, lacking adequate space, with narrow and crowded passages and  entrances, dirty beds, sheets, pillows, insufficient lights and ventilation and  lack of privacy for the patients. Catering to a patient who suddenly took a  turn for the worse was impossible under these conditions for there was no space  around the patient's bed for any intervention and there was no way such a  patient could be shifted out immediately for transfer to an intensive care  area. The number of toilets and bathrooms were not in adequate proportion to  the number of beds provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					In nearly all the hospitals it was found that  the waste disposal was shocking. Most deposited it into the common garbage dump  of the locality. There was no segregation of gauze and dressings soaked by  blood or exudates. Sharps were not destroyed before disposal.
				</p>
				<p>
					If these are the findings in the city of Mumbai  and in an average district of Maharashtra, can you imagine the condition of  private hospitals in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa and  Madhya Pradesh?
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors in private hospitals tend to ask for  many more tests than are required on clinical grounds and perform unnecessary  operations. The Kerala Shashtra Sahitya Parishad study revealed that of the  total number of Caesarean deliveries conducted, seventy percent were performed  in private hospitals. Tests and cross-consultations are often recommended  because of the kickbacks received rather than for the actual diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					When, however, patients in private hospitals  develop complications, they are promptly referred to public hospitals so that  the doctors under whom these complications developed are not liable when death  follows and their images remain untarnished. Most private hospitals refuse  admission to accident cases (even if the accident occurs next to the hospital)  and those involving medico-legal work even when the patient is in a serious  state.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Fees</h4>
				<p>
					Another major problem related to private hospitals is with regard to the fees  charged. There are no restrictions on what is to be charged and no fixed basis  for levying such charges. There are no guidelines on fees charged by private  hospitals. Fees are often irrationally exorbitant.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Public scrutiny</h4>
				<p>
					What, then, needs to be done if these private hospitals are to be forced to  attain and maintain an uniformly high standard?
				</p>
				<p>
					First of all, we need national, enforceable  guidelines categorising private hospitals, by size and laying down the minimum  requirements to be fulfilled by each hospital in each category. These  guidelines must encompass standards on location, layout, environment,  approaches, architecture, equipment and staff. Stringent guidelines are  necessary to ensure that whilst a fair financial return is ensured to the  person(s) running the hospital, fees are charged on the rational basis of a  nationally and regionally accepted formula.
				</p>
				<p>
					Private hospitals from the humblest nursing  home upwards must be compelled to publish their balance sheets and statistics  on patients treated during each financial year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the dismal. state of our body politic,  such steps are unlikely to be taken for quite some time. Can anything be done  in the meantime?
				</p>
				<p>
					All aspects of the functioning of private  hospitals must attract a closer look by consumers. Citizens must make their  demand for regulation of private hospitals in the country heard by those in  power.
