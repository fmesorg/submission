				<h4>Uninformed consent, but ethical anyway?</h4>
				<p>
					<em>(In  response to the report regarding a mentally disabled man, Prakash, whose kidney  was transplanted into his brother, Subramanyam, we asked readers to send in  their responses)</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Did  Prakash give his informed consent for his kidney to be removed and transplanted  into his brother? <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="What do you think? Issues in Medical Ethics, 1999; VII (2): 38." id="1">(1)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually,  Prakash did not 'donate' his kidney. His mother did it presumably for the  greater good of the greatest number.The patient's family, which included  Prakash himself, wanted to save the life of their sole breadwinner.
				</p>
				<p>
					As Dr  Arun Bal points out <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bal Arun: 'Informed consent: legal and ethical aspects. Issues in Medical Ethics, 1999. VII (2): 56-7" id="2">(2)</a>, informed consent has both legal and ethical  aspects.Legally speaking, Prakash's autonomy was restricted because of his  mental disability.It was also the ethical obligation of the family to save  Subramanyam's life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  mother, in her discretion, presumed her mentally challenged son's consent, a  1:1 possibility if he were mentally sound. The 'donation' might be interpreted  as amounting to 'battery and assault'. It could also eventually protect the  quality of life for the family of five. In the circumstances, it was a family  obligation fulfilled by Prakash without his being capable of understanding his  'humane'act.
