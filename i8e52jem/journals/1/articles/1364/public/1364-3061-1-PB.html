					Multidrug resistant infections are on the increase and include  common community-acquired infections such as typhoid, malaria and  tuberculosis. Multidrug resistant typhoid fever assumed epidemic proportions in  the country some years ago, initially catching physicians unawares. As the  epidemic worsened, many new antibiotics were marketed, and physicians chose  drugs on the basis of whim more than scientific validity or consensus. Most  patients recovered but over a prolonged time.It was clear that the epidemiology  of typhoid fever had changed. Many lessons have been learnt through this  epidemic and need due consideration.

				<h4>Origin of the MDR typhoid epidemic</h4>
				<p>
					Complacence about the  typhoid vaccine and its non-availability, coupled with poor sanitation,  nonpotable water supply and contaminated food &ndash; all led to a higher prevalence  of typhoid fever in children. Large-scale, irrational use of anti-typhoid  antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole and furazolidone for common  diarrhoeal illnesses prepared fertile ground for the development of multidrug  resistance. Physicians treated individual patients "without taking any risks",  with scant regard for scientific rationality, and even at the cost of the  community. This contributed to the present MDR typhoid epidemic.

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Wide clinical spectrum of the disease</h4>
				<p>
					Typhoid fever is a  disseminated systemic disease, but in the majority of patients, its  manifestations used to be localised in the intestines and the  reticuloendothelial system. Complications were rare and confined to intestinal  haemorrhage or perforation. In its epidemic form, however the disease with  involvement of all systems. Liver affection was evident in most patients, as  suggested by raised enzymes and at times even bilirubin. Cholecystitis was a  common feature easily made out on abdominal sonogram. In fact, such findings  offered clues to the diagnosis of typhoid fever. CNS manifestations included  encephalopathy, myelopathy and cerebellar signs. Nephritis, osteomyelitis and  many other lesions were occasionally reported.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Need for obtaining proof of MDR infection</h4>
				<p>
					Most physicians in India  are used to diagnosing infection without bacteriological proof. This practice  evolved from a lack of bacteriological facilities compounded by a lack of  initiative to pursue proof of infection. Physicians prefer to spend money on  different drugs rather than obtain proof of diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same time, patients are trained to expect a cure without  diagnosis. The recent typhoid epidemic has taught many physicians to consider  bacteriological proof to confirm drug resistance in support of poor response to  treatment.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Choice of antibiotic</h4>
				<p>
					In the initial period of  the epidemic, resistance was evident to most of the first line of antibiotics.  Newer antibiotics such as quinolones and cephalosporins had retained  sensitivity. Thus, ciprofloxacin was considered the drug of choice, its merits  being its oral form, convenient dosage schedule and a reasonable safety  profile. A number of clinical studies disproved earlier fears of damage to  growing cartilage. Third generation cephalosporins were inferior alternatives  because they were in parenteral form.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, despite using the newer antibiotics, patients did not  improve over several days. In the earlier days of chloramphenicol sensitivity,  physicians were used to obtaining defervescence of fever within three to four  days of starting the antibiotic. This did not happen with the newer drugs,and  the way was paved for drug combinations, frequent changes of antibiotics and  irrationality in treatment protocols, with no single, drug or combination  proven better than another.
				</p>
				<p>
					Drug resistance started surfacing with newer drugs as well. It was  realised much later that despite retaining sensitivity, MIC levels of the drug  had gone up considerably, necessitating higher doses for adequate  concentrations. Conventional doses led to a poor response even when the strain  was drug sensitive.
				</p>
				<p>
					After this fact came to light, the recommended dose of ciprofloxacin  became 30 mg/ kg/ day and not 20 mg. A single antibiotic in the correct dose  should suffice to treat typhoid successfully and there is no reason to use drug  combinations.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Duration of treatment</h4>
				<p>
					Conventionally, therapy  is continued at least for a week after control of fever. Many physicians change  the drug after a few days from parenteral third generation cephalosporin to  oral second generation, for the sake of convenience. This does not make sense.  A change of molecule, even from the same group of antibiotics, does not  guarantee a similar response.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Expected outcome</h4>
				<p>
					Due to this changing  epidemiology, the disease seems to run a much longer course than expected, even  when a sensitive drug is used in adequate doses. This is partly due to  upgrading of MIC levels of the drug, necessitating a higher dose.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is ironical that many patients on the newer antibiotics take  more than 10-14 days to become afebrile, unlike earlier when chloramphenicol  controlled fever within three to four days. It is a warning for the future.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Changing drug sensitivity in recent times</h4>
				<p>
					With the constant use of  newer antibiotics, the first line of drugs has not been used for some years  now. This has resulted in reversing of sensitivity to the conventional drugs  and the slow appearance of resistance to newer drugs. It is time to reconsider  the first line of drugs, keeping the newer drugs in reserve.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Prevention of MDR typhoid</h4>
				<p>
					The rational use of  antibiotics and propagating vaccination of susceptible people seem to be the  key factors in preventing MDR typhoid. With the advent of MDR typhoid fever in  the community, the market is flooded with different vaccines. Newer vaccines  such as oral TY 21A or Vi are as efficacious as the conventional phenol killed  TA vaccine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MDR typhoid epidemic has taught us a lesson. Physicians have  been largely responsible for this epidemic. Vaccine coverage of the susceptible  population and rational choice of drugs to treat bacteriologically-proven  infections will go a long way in preventing such epidemics in the future.
