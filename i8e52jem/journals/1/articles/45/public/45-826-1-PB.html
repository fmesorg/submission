			<h2>CORRUPTION IN HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE</h2>
			<h3>Corruption in healthcare and medicine: Why should physicians and bioethicists care and what should they do?</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Subrata Chattopadhyay</h4>
			<hr />

			<div class="intro">
				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					Corruption, an undeniable reality in the health sector, is arguably
					the most serious ethical crisis in medicine today. However, it
					remains poorly addressed in scholarly journals and by professional
					associations of physicians and bioethicists. This article provides an
					overview of the forms and dynamics of corruption in healthcare
					as well as its,implications in health and medicine. Corruption
					traps millions of people in poverty, perpetuates the existing
					inequalities in income and health, drains the available resources
					undermines people's access to healthcare, increases the costs of
					patient care and, by setting up a vicious cycle, contributes to ill
					health and suffering. No public health programme can succeed
					in a setting in which scarce resources are siphoned off, depriving
					the disadvantaged and poor of essential healthcare. Quality care
					cannot be provided by a healthcare delivery system in which
					kickbacks and bribery are a part of life. The medical profession,
					historically considered a noble one, and the bioethics community
					cannot evade their moral responsibility in the face of this sordid
					reality. There is a need to engage in public discussions and take a
					stand - against unethical and corrupt practices in healthcare and
					medicine - for the sake of the individual's well-being as well as for
					social good.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>

				<p>
					Corruption is, to say the least, a complex phenomenon and a
					difficult problem. It is complex because of its deep roots in
					the social, cultural, economic, political, legal, and ethical value
					systems of individuals, communities, cultures, and countries. It
					is a difficult problem because it defies easy answers and resists
					any single-track, copy-book model of solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					There was a period in the not-so-distant past when corruption
					was considered, at best, merely an issue of development and,
					at worst, a socioeconomic issue beyond the world of scientific
					medicine. In the recent past, however, corruption in the health
					sector has raised serious concern and received global attention
					among researchers and policy-makers <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T. Review of corruption in the health sector: theory, methods and interventions. Health Policy Plan. 2008 Mar;23(2):83-94. doi: 10.1093/ heapol/czm048.

					2003, the UN General Assembly adopted the United Nations
					Convention against Corruption, which came into force in 2005.
					Other UN agencies have also undertaken anti-corruption
					measures in health. For example, the Good Governance for
					Medicines programme, launched as part of the World Health
					Organisation Medicines Strategy, 2004-2007, incorporated
					corruption as a priority issue. Further, having recognised the relationship between child mortality and corruption, the United
					Nations Children's Fund linked its promotion of child rights to
					good governance <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Programme.

				<p>
					Undermining the moral vision&mdash;and nobility&mdash;of the art of
					healing, corruption is arguably the most serious ethical crisis
					in medicine today. Thus, understanding corruption, its varied
					nature and its adverse effects on health outcomes is absolutely
					necessary for healthcare professionals in the 21st century,
					not only to steer clear of fraud, but also to devise effective
					strategies to tackle the menace and safeguard the moral vision
					of medicine <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abbasi K. Guiding the moral vision of medicine.

				<h4>What is corruption?</h4>

				<p>
					Corruption has been defined as "the abuse of public office
					for private gain" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Bank. Helping countries to combat corruption. The role of the World Bank. World Bank;1997." id="8">(8)</a>. This definition appears to be narrow as it
					does not cover areas other than "public office." Transparency
					International, a global anti-corruption watchdog, defines
					corruption as "the abuse of entrusted power for private gain" <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International. Global Corruption Report 2006. London: Pluto Press; 2006." id="3">(3)</a>. Questions may arise about how terms such as "private"
					(or "public") are defined and whether it would be ethically
					justifiable to abuse entrusted power for <em>shared collective gain</em>.
					Private gain may also be either actual (or immediately available)
					or potential (to be realised in the future), and financial or
					even political. It is thus extremely difficult, if not impossible,
					to provide a definition of corruption which is applicable to
					all its forms, types and degrees across various cultures to the
					satisfaction of all stakeholders. In the absence of such an allinclusive
					and precise definition, "the abuse of entrusted power
					for private gain" may serve as a 'working definition' as it could
					cover, in general, most of the unethical and corrupt practices in
					the health sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corruption is pervasive across cultures and endemic in
					countries, be they small or large, poor or rich, capitalist or
					socialist or in the North or South <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International. Global Corruption Report 2006. London: Pluto Press; 2006." id="3">(3)</a>. Newspapers generally
					capture only startling instances of large-scale corruption. Petty
					corruption, however, has long been a part of, or rather a way
					of, 'normal' life in many parts of the globe. Furthermore, those
					who take or give bribes in a particular setting (eg an office or
					the residence of an official) may claim in another setting (e.g. a
					court) that these were 'gifts'. Thus, cultural interpretations and
					legal implications of what is perceived of as corruption may
					also vary from one context to another.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>What are the forms of corruption in healthcare and
				medicine?</h4>
				<p>
					The problem of corruption in healthcare is of a multidimensional
					nature. Corruption may be involved, for example,
					in construction of health centres/hospitals, purchase of
					instruments, supply of medicines and goods, overbilling
					in insurance claims and even appointment of healthcare
					professionals. Another aspect of the problem is the involvement
					of multiple parties, e.g. policy-makers, ministers, economists,
					engineers, contractors, suppliers, and doctors. All this may
					give rise to innumerable clandestine transactions of a corrupt
					nature among various stakeholders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forms of corruption in healthcare and medicine may include,
					but not be limited to, the following <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T. Review of corruption in the health sector: theory, methods and interventions. Health Policy Plan. 2008 Mar;23(2):83-94. doi: 10.1093/ heapol/czm048.

				</p>
				<h5>Bribes and kickbacks</h5>
				<p>
					Characterised as hallmarks of corruption, bribes and kickbacks
					can be paid by individuals and firms to (i) procure government
					contracts, leases or licences for the construction of healthcare
					facilities, and for the supply of medicines, goods and services,
					as well as ensure the terms of their contracts; (ii) prefix and
					'rig' the bidding process; (iii) manipulate and falsify records,
					and modify 'evidence' to give the appearance of its being in
					compliance with the norms of regulatory agencies; (iv) speed
					up the procedure of permission to carry out legal activities,
					eg obtaining institutional affiliation, company registration
					or construction permits; and (v) influence or change legal
					outcomes so as to avoid punishment for wrong-doing <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International. Global Corruption Report 2006. London: Pluto Press; 2006." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Programme.

Available from: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/anti-corruption/fighting_corruptioninthehealthsector/" id="5">5)</a>.
				</p>
				<h5>Theft and embezzlement</h5>
				<p>
					This may occur as theft of public assets and goods, such as
					instruments and medicines, by individuals for sale, personal
					use or use in for-profit private clinics. The theft of government
					revenues, such as patient registration fees, and the payment
					of salary to deceased or "ghost" workers are other forms of
					corruption <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International. Global Corruption Report 2006. London: Pluto Press; 2006." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Programme.

Available from: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/anti-corruption/fighting_corruptioninthehealthsector/" id="5">5)</a>.
				</p>
				<h5>Intentional damage to public goods for private gain1</h5>
				<p>
					Public assets and instruments in government hospitals may
					also be intentionally damaged so as to make them unavailable
					to patients, with the ultimate aim of ordering the services from
					private clinics in return for financial incentives or "commission."
				</p>
				<h5>Absenteeism</h5>
				<p>
					Perceived somewhat less often as a form of corruption,
					absenteeism (not attending work but claiming salary) in the
					health sector has been a major concern in some developing
					countries <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Programme. Fighting corruption in the health sector – methods, tools and good practices [Internet]. New York: United Nations Development Programme; 2011Oct 31[cited2013 Jul 4]. Available from: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/anti-corruption/fighting_corruptioninthehealthsector/" id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<h5>Informal payments</h5>
				<p>
					In some countries, patients commonly make informal payments
					to healthcare professionals for better services. The imposition
					of such a "tax" on "free" healthcare services has a negative
					impact on access to health services <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Programme. Fighting corruption in the health sector – methods, tools and good practices [Internet]. New York: United Nations Development Programme; 2011Oct 31[cited2013 Jul 4]. Available from: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/anti-corruption/fighting_corruptioninthehealthsector/" id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<h5>Use of human subjects for financial gain</h5>
				<p>
					Clinical researchers get paid by the biomedical industry for
					the recruitment of poor and illiterate, ie vulnerable, human
					subjects for clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous. Illiterate persons not to be used for clinical trials. Times of India[Internet]. 2011 Sep 7[cited 2013 Jun12].

					and physicians use patients is by charging uninsured patients
					and patients with other health plans far more than the actual
					costs involved and what the health insurers pay.
				</p>
				<h5>Institutionalised potential corruption</h5>
				<p>
					In some for-profit hospitals, physicians have contractual
					obligations to admit a fixed number of patients to allotted
					beds and prescribe a number of laboratory investigations (even
					if unnecessary) to generate revenues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whatever the form, corruption has far-reaching consequences
					on patient care, clinical research and medical education, as
					outlined in Table 1.

				<h4>Case studies: windows into how corruption affects
				health sector</h4>

				<p>
					Published reports on the exploitation of human subjects in
					clinical trials and the scam in the National Rural Health Mission
					(NRHM) in Uttar Pradesh (UP), India, give us a window into how
					unethical and corrupt practices can mar clinical research and
					public health programmes, turning them, quite literally, into

					Perhaps this is the price for putting economics before ethics.
					In 2005, as a policy pursuant to economic liberalisation, the
					Government of India amended Schedule Y of the Drugs and
					Cosmetics Act to permit concurrent phase II and phase III
					trials in India <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Srinivasan S, Loff B. Medical research in India. Lancet. 2006 Jun 17;367(9527):1962-4." id="13">(13)</a>. A myriad of factors, such as substantial
					reduction in time and cost in conducting clinical trials, diverse
					population, English-speaking healthcare professionals and less
					stringent regulatory mechanisms, made India one of the most
					attractive locations of clinical trials. Not surprisingly, there was a
					substantial growth in the number of clinical trials held in India
					from 2005. In 2000, the Indian Council of Medical Research
					(ICMR) had issued ethical guidelines for biomedical research
					on human subjects (modified in 2006) and the registration of
					clinical trials was made mandatory by the Drugs Controller
					General of India (DGCI) in 2009. However, the ICMR guidelines
					are not legally binding, while the DCGI is understaffed and illequipped
					to monitor and regulate research effectively. Thus,
					blatant unethical practices, such as providing lucrative financial
					incentives for the recruitment of human subjects, obtaining
					"informed-but-not-understood-consent" from poor illiterate
					"volunteers," and failing to provide compensation for the death
					of participants in trials, have become a part of the booming
					industry of clinical trials in India <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sengupta A.

					Part of the threat that the industry of clinical trials poses
					to India stems from the fact that these trials, conducted
					mostly by the contract research organisations (CROs) hired
					by pharmaceutical companies, are essentially commercial
					ventures in the garb of benevolent medical research. The
					question arises as to whether the drugs tested in India will
					actually benefit or be affordable for needy patients. The crisis
					is further compounded by the dampening "ethical climate"

					in the corruption perception index <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International India. New Delhi: Transparency International India; c2013[cited 2013 Jul 4]. Available from: http://www.transparency. org/country#IND" id="18">(18)</a>. In a country where
					corruption is undeniably an all-pervasive part of life, including
					healthcare and medicine, it is hard to imagine that if at some
					point, provisions are made for ethical oversight of all clinical
					research, such oversight will be of the highest standards and
					that "guinea pigs in human form" will get high-quality care in
					keeping with ethical standards. Questions thus arise whether
					it is ethically justifiable to allow the conduct of clinical trials
					to begin with, in the absence of ethical oversight, effective
					regulatory mechanisms and an appropriate compensation
					policy for the participants, especially in countries plagued by
					corruption.

					Crores of rupees were thus spent on the construction of nonexistent

					This scam not only perpetuated ill health and suffering
					among the rural poor, but also cost six lives. Among the six
					persons who died are top-ranking medical officers, murdered
					presumably as part of a cover-up operation to hush up the
					wrongdoing.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is fearsome is that it is only the tip of the iceberg which
					is visible; the bottom of the "iceberg" of corruption is almost
					untraceable. Sadly, the art of healing has turned into a science
					of stealing and the conspiracy to cover up has introduced
					criminality into medicine. What is scandalous is that doctors
					are not only among the victims of corruption; they are also
					beneficiaries and perpetrators, together with the others
					involved in the larger nexus that is threatening to undermine
					the very foundation of medicine. The question arises as to what
					physicians and bioethicists should do to tackle the menace of
					corruption and to answer this, one must be clear on why they
					should do something in the first place.
				</p>

			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Medical corruption: why should physicians and
				bioethicists care?</h4>

				<p>
					There are a number of good reasons why physicians and
					bioethicists should care about corruption, discuss the problems
					that corruption creates and perpetuates in healthcare and
					medicine, explore possible remedial measures to tackle the
					menace, and take a stand against unethical and corrupt
					practices in the health sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first is, to put it simply, corruption <em>kills.</em> The difference
					between life and death, good health and suffering is often
					determined by corruption. Not surprisingly, the poor suffer the
					most. Three of the UN's eight Millennium Development Goals,
					which are intended to reduce poverty by half by 2015, relate
					directly to health: reducing child mortality, improving maternal
					health, and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corruption in the healthcare system has been revealed as one
					of the factors responsible for the failure to fulfil these goals
					by the target date <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Transparency International. Global Corruption Report 2006. London: Pluto Press; 2006." id="3">(3)</a>. Corruption also exacerbates the harm
					caused by natural disasters. For example, the death toll in the
					earthquake in Haiti was directly related to corruption. Buildings
					certified as earthquake-resistant had not been constructed
					properly because the system was plagued by corruption and
					thus, there was a lack of oversight <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ambraseys N, Bilham R. Corruption kills. Nature. 2011Jan13;469(7329):153-5." id="24">(24)</a>. If physicians are really
					opposed to serving the machinery of death, oiled by corrupt
					practices in medicine, they need to address the issue, discuss it
					and take a stand against it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second is that corruption fosters ill health and prolongs
					suffering. On the other hand, good governance (reduced
					corruption) is associated with better health outcomes. A
					transnational study found that the quality of governance
					was positively associated with higher life expectancy, lower
					mortality rates for children and mothers, and higher levels
					of subjective feelings of health <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Holmberg S, Rothstein B. Dying of corruption. Health Econ Policy Law. 2011 Oct;6(4):529-47." id="25">(25)</a>. By taking a stand against
					corruption and in favour of appropriate anti-corruption
					measures, healthcare professionals may create opportunities
					for good governance and consequently, better health
					outcomes for the population.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirdly, corruption undermines the patient's trust in the
					physician and healthcare delivery system. Trust lies at the core
					of the doctor-patient relationship in medicine. "Trust is critical
					to patients' willingness to seek care, reveal sensitive information,
					submit to treatment, and follow physicians' recommendations."
					<a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hall MA, Camacho F, Dugan E, Balkrishnan R. Trust in the medical profession: conceptual and measurement issues. Health Serv Res. 2002 Oct; 37(5):1419-39." id="26">(26)</a>. Patients would not like to see a doctor they do not trust
					and would be loath to accept such a doctor's advice. By taking
					a stand on corruption, physicians and bioethicists can start
					rebuilding the trust of patients and the people at large.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fourth is that corruption destroys the moral vision of
					medicine. Ethics lies at the heart of medicine-it is difficult to
					imagine a good but corrupt physician. Few would disagree that
					medicine sans morality turns this praxis into one of stealing,
					killing and criminality. Those who have embraced a noble
					profession like medicine cannot afford the luxury of "doing
					nothing" when its ethical foundation is being endangered by
					unethical and corrupt practices <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Campbell AV. Can virtue prevail? Safeguarding integrity in medicine and science Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Jan-Mar;10(1):11-13." id="27">(27)</a>.

				<h4>Towards a new beginning: what should physicians
				and bioethicists do to tackle the menace of
				corruption?</h4>

				<p>
					Corruption in the health sector is not just an issue of
					development, or a legal issue pertaining to fraud and
					abuse, but also an issue concerning ethics. As darkness is
					characterised by lack of light, corruption is characterised
					by a lack of moral values. Regrettably, the word "corruption"
					is conspicuous by its near absence in the agenda and
					vocabulary of academic medicine. At most, mention is made of
					"professional misconduct." Worse still is the deafening silence
					of the medical profession when the cause of ethics in medicine
					is at stake. Furthermore, bioethicists, who are the modern-day
					custodians of morality in medicine, have little, if any, interest
					in addressing this "dull" social problem. Unlike esoteric ethical
					puzzles such as determining the moral status of a part-human
					part-animal embryo, this problem does not trigger enough
					hair-splitting debates to satisfy their philosophical minds. The
					initiation of proactive measures to counter corruption in all its
					manifestations is long overdue. A number of anti-corruption
					measures that could provide a starting point are outlined
					below.
				</p>
				<ol>

					<h5>
					<li>
						Zero tolerance for unethical and corrupt practices in health
					</li></h5>

					<p>
						Physicians, professional medical associations of diverse
						disciplines and the bioethics community should discuss possible anti-corruption measures and implement a publicly
						declared <em>policy of zero tolerance for unethical and corrupt
						practices in the care of patients, clinical research and medical
						education</em>. This entails, among other things, taking appropriate
						measures to counter unnecessary investigations and
						overbilling, censuring members with questionable integrity,
						developing mechanisms to handle allegations of misconduct,
						and promoting transparency and accountability in diverse
						aspects of medicine.
					</p>

					<h5>
					<li>
						Whole-hearted support for anti-corruption measures
					</li></h5>

					<p>
						Physicians and bioethicists should support, whole-heartedly and
						without reservation, the anti-corruption initiatives undertaken
						by the other sections of society and state, such as civil society,
						patient rights groups, voluntary health associations, nongovernmental
						organisations (NGOs), the judiciary, and the media.
						This would help build good governance and a just society.
					</p>

					<h5>
					<li>
						Protection of whistle-blowers
					</li></h5>

					<p>
						Physicians and bioethicists should provide moral support and
						legal help to members of their profession or discipline who
						have dared to expose serious wrong doing in any aspect of
						healthcare and medicine. This is necessary because whistleblowers
						run the risk of facing harassment, if not harm, by vested
						interests. <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Campbell AV. Can virtue prevail? Safeguarding integrity in medicine and science Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Jan-Mar;10(1):11-13." id="27">(27)</a>
					</p>

					<h5>
					<li>
						Legislation
					</li></h5>

					<p>
						Physicians and bioethicists should play a more proactive
						role in pressing for the enactment and implementation of
						legislation and regulations for good governance, transparency
						and accountability in healthcare and medicine. Anti-corruption
						laws are frequently breached because of inadequate regulation
						and monitoring, or the absence of effective penalties. One
						solution could be to set up an office of ombudsman to deal
						with corruption (eg Lokpal) in every district, province and state
						capital. The ombudsman should be equipped with adequate
						resources, infrastructure and real powers.
					</p>

					<h5>
					<li>
						Education
					</li></h5>

					<p>
						The importance of (continuing) education can hardly be
						overemphasised. It is hard to believe that all young men and
						women join medicine only to make money out of people's
						illness. Education in ethics through the use of positive role
						models may reinforce moral values. It would help present and
						future healthcare professionals not only to steer clear of fraud
						and abuse, but also to create a favourable ethical climate within
						the profession <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Campbell AV. Can virtue prevail? Safeguarding integrity in medicine and science Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Jan-Mar;10(1):11-13." id="27">(27)</a>.
					</p>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>

				<p>
					It is time to acknowledge that corruption in healthcare entails
					crimes against humanity. There is no room for complacency-
					history will not forgive physicians and bioethicists if they fail in
					their moral duty to safeguard the cause of ethics in medicine
					when it is necessary.
