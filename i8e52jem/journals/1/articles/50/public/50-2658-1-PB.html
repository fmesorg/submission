				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					<strong>Background</strong>: This aim of this study was to assess the  degree to which the doctors of a public sector hospital in Karachi  adhere to medical ethics during their consultations.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Material and methods:</strong> A cross-sectional study was  conducted in Civil Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan, during April-June 2010.  337 patients from Out Patients Departments (OPDs) and wards were  recruited through consecutive sampling. A pre-tested structured  questionnaire was administered to the participants and they were asked  about their demographic profile, and their doctor's practices regarding  obtaining informed consent, respecting privacy and confidentiality, and  treatment modalities. Written informed consent was taken from all the  participants. Data was analysed using SPSS version 16.0, and a p-value  of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong>
					The mean age of the study population was 38.4 &#177; 15.0 years. There was an equal ratio of males and females. Our study  showed that informed consent was obtained from 66.4% of patients. 56.9%  of patients responded that they were not informed about the side effects  of the prescribed medicines. 74% females were satisfied with the  privacy maintained during the consultation. 64.8% were assured of the  confidentiality of their information. Regarding advertisement by  doctors, 46.5% of patients said it should be done.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> There has been a marked improvement as  compared with the previous practices  of biomedical ethics by the  doctors of this public sector hospital. However, awareness sessions  should be conducted to update/ improve the knowledge of ethics among  doctors to help them translate their knowledge into practice.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Biomedical ethics is the study of morality in medicine <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="McCullough LB, Chervenak FA.

				</p>
				<p>
					There are well-established ethical frameworks in the field of  medicine in the western world <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Humayun A, Fatima N, Naqqash S, Hussain S, Rasheed A, Imtiaz H, Imam SZ.

However, despite the fact that the regulatory body for  medicine, the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), has formulated  a code of ethics for doctors, no significant steps have been taken to  ensure its implementation <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Shiraz B, Shamim MS, Shamim MS, Ahmed A.

				</p>
				<p>
					In recent times, there has been a change in the thinking of  patients, mainly due to the greater influence of information technology,  primarily of the electronic media (radio and television) and the  internet <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shamim MS. Medical Ethics: A slow but sustained revolution in Pakistan's healthcare. J Pak Med Assoc. 2010Sep;60(9): 706-7." id="3">(3)</a>. Thus, due to increasing awareness, patients demand to be fully informed about options, treatment plans and possible complications, aspects which were not present in the past <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shamim MS. Medical Ethics: A slow but sustained revolution in Pakistan's healthcare. J Pak Med Assoc. 2010Sep;60(9): 706-7." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Considering this changing trend and level of awareness, this study  was conducted at a public sector hospital in Karachi, to determine the  degree to which ethical codes of medicine have been put into practice  according to the patient perspective.
				</p>

				<h4>Material and methods</h4>
				<p>
					This cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Civil Hospital  (CHK), a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, the largest city in, and  economic hub of, Pakistan. The data were collected from April to June  2010. Patients between 18 to 60 years visiting the Out Patients  Department (OPD) or admitted into the wards were recruited through  consecutive sampling. However, patients who had been admitted for severe  burn injuries; or diagnosed with any serious psychiatric disorder (such  as schizophrenia, mood disorders); or were agitated due to severe pain,  and/ or comatose; or had a hearing difficulty or a language barrier  were excluded. Patients admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and  those visiting the Emergency Department were also excluded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Totally 337 patients were recruited; on the basis of the  assumption that 50% of the doctors in Pakistan respect confidentiality  and privacy and obtain informed consent from their patients. The number  was also chosen to obtain maximum variance with 6% bound on error and an  addition of 25% for non-responders. The final sample size was  approximately 337 patients. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was  administered to collect information. Pre-testing was done on 5% (17  patients) of the sample size and any changes deemed necessary were made.  The questionnaire comprised two sections. The first section had  information on the socio-demographic profile of patients including age,  sex and marital status. The second section had questions on doctors'  practice of obtaining informed consent: whether written/verbal informed  consent was obtained; whether patients were informed about the  indications for a treatment, possible side-effects, alternative  treatments, the expected benefit of the treatment, etc.), privacy,  confidentiality, doctors advertisement etc. The questionnaire was  developed in English and then back translated for accuracy. The  questionnaire required approximately 30 minutes to complete. Data were  collected by medical students specifically trained for this task.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Ethics Review Board (ERB) of Dow University of Health Sciences  (DUHS) reviewed and approved the study. Written informed consent was  obtained from the participants after the study protocol was explained to  them and they were assured of the confidentiality and anonymity of the  information.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
				<p>
					Data were entered and analysed using Statistical Package for  Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0. Normality of the data was assessed  and mean and standard deviation were computed for continuous and  proportions for the categorical variables. To determine the differences  between gender, chi-square or Fisher's exact test was applied as  appropriate and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically  significant.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					337 patients were interviewed. There were 169 males and 168  females (M: F = 1:1). The mean age of study participants was 38.4 + 15  years. The baseline characteristics of the study participants are  presented in Table 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study showed that 66.4% of the total patients reported that  doctors had taken informed consent. There was no significant association  of written/verbal informed consent with gender, education and location  (OPD or wards), estimated through the chi-square test. Overall, 73% of  patients reported being assured about the confidentiality of their  information. Approximately 80.4% of the male patients reported being  assured of confidentiality of information as compared to their female  counter parts (P=0.003).  However, according to 39% of male  participants, proper privacy was not maintained during their clinical  examination (Table 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					28.5% out of 133 illiterate patients responded that they were not  told about the disease from which they were suffering (P=0.006), making  it more difficult for them to avail of better treatment options.  Approximately 62% (P=0.017) of patients educated below the matric level  were told about the action of the medication. However, 53% (P=0.004) of  them were not briefed on the side-effects of prescribed medicines. An  equal percentage reported that their doctors did not explain alternative  options to their patients (P=0.001) on observing those side-effects  (Table 3).
				</p>
				<p>
					It was interesting to note that while 48.3% patients were  influenced by doctors' advertisements, 46.2% were not influenced by  these advertisements (P=0.0001) (Table 4).
				</p>
				<p>
					Figure 1 depicts that 51% of the patients were in favor of  doctors' advertisements. Nevertheless, about 31% patient responded that  they were not in favour of doctors' advertisements.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Many studies have shown that patients depend on their doctors for  all decisions regarding their illness and its treatment <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yousaf RM, Fauzi ARM, How SH, Rasool AG, Rehana K.

Informed consent–a survey of doctors' practices in South Africa. S Afr Med J. 1995 Dec;85(12): 1273-8." id="13">(13)</a>, also report that the practice  of medical ethics by doctors is not satisfactory and often does not  meet legal requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this study, we set out to determine the extent to which medical  ethics is practised by doctors. The proportion of patients in our study  population reporting that their doctor took their informed consent is  higher than that in other studies conducted in Pakistan <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Amin FM, Jawaid M, Rehman S, Mudassir, Hina, Zakai SB . An audit of information provided during preoperative informed consent. Pak J Med Sci. 2006;22:10-13." id="14">(14)</a>. In our  study informed consent was not taken from almost 30% of the patients. A  study conducted by Humayun et al in Lahore <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Humayun A, Fatima N, Naqqash S, Hussain S, Rasheed A, Imtiaz H, Imam SZ. Patients' perception and actual practice of informed consent, privacy and confidentiality in general medical outpatient departments of two tertiary care hospitals of Lahore. BMC Medical Ethics. 2008Sep 25;9:14." id="2">(2)</a> reported that informed  consent was not taken from about 90% of the patients at a public sector  hospital. This observed difference in study results may be due to the  fact that our study was conducted at a teaching hospital where doctors  may tend to adhere more to the principles of medical ethics as compared  to those at non-teaching hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					A doctor must address five issues in order to take complete  informed consent: the nature of the proposed procedure, its purpose, the  risks, the benefits, and the availability of alternatives <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhurgri H, Qidwai W. Awareness of the process of informed consent among family practice patients in Karachi. J Pak Med Assoc. Jul;54(7):398-401." id="15">(15)</a>. Our  study also highlights the extent to which a physician discusses his  clinical decisions with the patient. The results show that there was a  significant association between the patient's level of education and the  patient's questioning the doctor about his diagnosis. In the study  laboratory investigations and other relevant findings did not have  significant association with the level of education of the patients  (Table 3). However, the level of education was significantly related to  the reported effects, side-effects and alternatives on observing side  effects. These statistically significant associations emphasise the fact  that there is an increasing awareness about healthcare and this has  altered the public's thinking; people are now more eager to know their  complete medical status and the treatment options available.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study also looked at doctors' practice of maintaining  confidentiality. Only 14% of the patients were not completely sure that  their confidentiality was maintained. This was quite different from  other local and international data <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Humayun A, Fatima N, Naqqash S, Hussain S, Rasheed A, Imtiaz H, Imam SZ.

Knowledge of and attitude toward patient confidentiality within three family medicine teaching units. Acad Med. 1998 Jun;73(6): 710-12." id="16">16)</a> With regard to privacy as  well, other reported studies have had a less satisfactory rate as  compared to ours. A study conducted in Karachi <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Imam SZ, Syed SK, Ali SU, Fatima K, Gill M, Hassan MO, Hashmi SH, Siddiqi MT, Khan HM, Jameel OF.

These findings, of an improved system  of informed consent, and better maintenance of privacy and  confidentiality, are important as this enables the patient to speak  frankly of their history and symptoms with the doctors <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shrier I, Green S, Solin J, Duarte-Franco E, Guibert R, Brousseau G, Khanlou N.

				</p>
				<p>
					The opinion of patients on doctors advertising was unanticipated.  48.3% of the sample approved of advertising, despite the fact that this  topic has been a matter of debate globally. A handful of authors, in  recent publications throughout the world, have argued in favour of  doctors advertising <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK. Advertising remains unethical even in the digital age. Indian J Med Ethics. 2001Jan-Mar;9(1):15." id="18">(18)</a>. They have asserted that, as long as the  advertisement does not contain any false or deceptive information, it is  acceptable <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK. Advertising remains unethical even in the digital age. Indian J Med Ethics. 2001Jan-Mar;9(1):15." id="18">(18)</a>. In our study, 46.2% of the patients stated that they  were not influenced by advertisements, as compared to 42.4% of  participants who were so influenced. The inference which could be drawn  from the result was that professional advertisements were acceptable  provided the main intention of any advertisement regarding a doctor's services is to present the information required by the patient to make a decision about the aptness and availability of the health services offered. According to the PMDC, a doctor may advertise his services but only if he observes the code of ethical conduct. The advertisement  should not exaggerate or mislead the public about the services <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pakistan Medical and Dental Council[Internet]: Pakistan: PMDC: c2006. Part V, Complaint against medical or dental practitioner and action thereon. [date unknown. cited 2013 Jan21]; [about 3 screens]. Available from: http://www.pmdc.org.pk/Ethics/tabid/101/Default.aspx#15" id="19">(19)</a>.  However, to the best of our knowledge, this aspect of medical ethics has  not been put before patients in earlier studies, and future research  into this intriguing aspect could yield more insights.
				</p>
				<p>
					As previously mentioned, the role of the doctor as sole decision  maker is changing. A study conducted in 1998 <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Asai A, Kishino M, Tsuguya F, Sakai M, Yokota M, Nakata K, Sasakabe" id="20">(20)</a> reported that patients  were satisfied with the fact that doctors were the ones making decisions  for them. Similar results were seen in another study in Malaysia and in  Kashmir in 2007 <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yousaf RM, Fauzi ARM, How SH, Rasool AG, Rehana K.

Singapore Med J. 2007Jun;48(6): 559-65." id="11">(11)</a>. However, with the public's growing awareness,  people demand to be fully informed of all clinical aspects <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shamim MS. Medical Ethics: A slow but sustained revolution in Pakistan's healthcare. J Pak Med Assoc. 2010Sep;60(9): 706-7." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This study has several potential limitations. The study was  conducted in a single hospital, and the results cannot be generalised  for all public sector hospitals in Pakistan. Second, the participants  recruited from the OPD were interviewed just after their session with  the doctors; while those patients in the wards were interviewed at  different times, which might have led to a limitation to recall bias.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The results of this study suggest that doctors at teaching  hospitals may have improved in the practice of ethics. However, since  the data were collected only at one teaching hospital, we cannot  comment on the ethical practices of physicians from the private  healthcare sector. Nonetheless, to encourage ethical medical practice,  steps should be taken to highlight the importance of the basic  principles of ethics: informed consent, privacy and confidentiality.  Furthermore, awareness building should be conducted for doctors to  improve and refresh their knowledge of ethical principles. Finally,  professional advertisements by doctors should not contain any  information that can be misleading for the patient.
