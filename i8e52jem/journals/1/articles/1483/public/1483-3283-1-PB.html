				<h4>Who decides what's good for my baby?</h4>
				<p>
					The  extraordinary developments in human genetics provide possibilities for the  prevention, diagnosis and treatment of inherited monogenetic diseases as well  as a wide spectrum of more common conditions which involve complex genetic and  environmental interplay. The question to be considered is: how are we to deal  with the new techniques of human genetics?
				</p>
				<p>
					How can  we reap the fruits and also steer clear of the dangers? The author discusses  three alternatives: the Pure Nazi model in which the state chooses a gene pool  and kills those who do not fit in; the Pure Eugenics model in which the state  achieves the same ends, but through forced sterilisation, and the Liberal  model, in which individuals are free to make decisions to control their genetic  contributions. The author argues against a ban on any form of research,  proposing, instead, that individuals be free to make their own choices, there  is individual freedom and there is no socially decided ideal of what is 'good'  or 'healthy'.

				<h4>Organ transplantation and the legal framework</h4>
				<p>
					Barely  30 years ago, organ transplantation was an essentially unsuccessful  experimental procedure conducted in pioneering medical research centres. Today,  renal transplantation is a widespread and routine procedure for an estimated  35,000 patients worldwide each year. However, this success led to an ever  increasing demand, a shortage of donors, and the commercialisation of the donor  supply. "What policies should be instituted to help increase the availability  of these precious tissues?" The author, who earlier wrote an essay in defence  of a commercial market, has reworked his ideas quite substantially. He answers  the question in the context of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994,  while examining its implications and the consequences of commercialisation &mdash; in  terms of organ availability, social justice, exploitation and so on.

				<h4>Sorry, out of stock</h4>
				<p>
					Drugs  offer a simple, cost effective solution to many health problems, provided they  are available, affordable, and properly used. However, effective treatment is  lacking in poor countries for many diseases, including African trypanosomiasis,  Shigella dysentery, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and bacterial meningitis.  Treatment may be precluded because no effective drug exists, it is too  expensive, or it has been withdrawn from the market. Moreover, research and  development in tropical diseases have come to a near standstill. The article  focuses on the problems of access to quality drugs for the treatment of  diseases that predominantly affect the developing world: (1) poor quality and  counterfeit drugs; (2) lack of availability of essential drugs due to fluctuating  production or prohibitive cost; (3) need to develop field-based drug research  to determine optimum utilisation and remotivate research and development for  new drugs for the developing world; and (4) potential consequences of recent  World Trade Organization agreements on the availability of old and new drugs.  These problems are related, and a result of the fundamental nature of the  pharmaceutical market and the way it is regulated.

				<h4>The infant food code</h4>
				<p>
					This  study of the prevalence of violations of the international code of marketing of  substitutes for breast milk, interviewed 1,468 pregnant women, 1582 mothers of  infants aged less than six months, and 466 health workers, at 165 health  facilities in one city in each of Bangladesh, Poland, South Africa, and  Thailand. Women were asked whether they had received free samples of breast  milk substitutes, bottles, or teats, and health workers were interviewed to  assess whether the facility had received free samples, how they had been used,  and whether gifts had been given to health workers by companies manufacturing  or distributing breast milk substitutes. Twenty-six per cent of Thai mothers  reported receiving free samples, compared to 1 out of 385 mothers in Dhaka.  Eight to 50% health facilities had received free samples which were not being  used for research or professional evaluation; two to 18% health workers had  received gifts from companies involved in the manufacturing or distribution of  breast milk substitutes. At 15 to 56% of the health facilities, information  violating the code had been provided by companies and was available to staff.

				<h4>Regulated research</h4>
				<p>
					This  report comments on controversial proposed U S government regulations governing  research of people with retardation, mental illness and brain disease. While  they would provide protection by regulating all such research, and requiring  the involvement of people with the problem, or advocacy organisations, they  would also legitimise research posing greater than minimal risk-benefit to  subjects' even though the subjects cannot give their informed consent, if their  guardians give consent.

				<h4>Is informed consent always necessary?</h4>
				<p>
				Researchers  must get specific informed consent of' patients in clinical trials, but doctors  may sometimes offer the same therapy without such consent, in the name of  innovation. The authors suggest that in many randomised. controlled trials,  patients' participation should be presumed by their general consent for  treatment. Criteria for a waiver: all treatments may be offered outside the  trial without specific informed consent; they do not involve more than minimal  additional risk compared to the alternatives; genuine equipose exists; no  reasonable person would prefer one treatment to the other ; patients know that  the institution uses the guidelines, and the institutional review board  approves. These criteria should be interpreted narrowly and applied  conservatively.</p>
				<p>The authors hold that this will not lead to patient  exploitation by researchers. Informed consent is not an ideal in itself' but is  meant to ensure that the patient's right to selfdetermination is respected. Studies  show patients rarely understand consent forms and randomisation. The most  effective protection against exploitation comes from conscienlious  institutional review. Boards approving questionable studies on the assumption  that the informed consent process will protect research subjects are not doing  their job.</p>
				<p>The current situation also prevents many small but meaningful  improvements in the quality of care when there is no reason to believe that the  patient has any preference regarding participation in research. </p>

				<h4>More on the AZT trials and research ethics.</h4>
				<p>
					This  comment on the controversial placebo-controlled trials clinical for maternal-foetal transmission of HIV may raise further debate. The author examines the  ethics of AZT-equivalence and placebo-controlled trials in developing  countries. Some of the points rnade: equivalence trials may result in fewer  deaths among trial participants and arrive at inconclusive answers, but a  placebo controlled trial will provide clearer answers, thus providing more help  to the general population even if fewer trial participants are benefited.  Finally, discussants in the debate "have assumed that it is straightforwardly a  good thing to reduce child deaths caused by perinatal transmission.... the  brutal truth ... is that the more children they save, the worse these treatments  will tend to make the AIDS orphan problem, for whom the only option is  international adoption.

				<h4>Why physician-assisted suicide ?</h4>
				<p>
					On  October 27, 1997, Oregon, USA, legalised physician-assisted suicide. Data on  the 22 terminally ill Oregonresidents who received prescriptions for lethal  medications under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act and who died in 1998 were  compared to those who died from si1nilar illnesses but did not receive such  prescriptions. The study concluded that during the first year of legalised  physician assisted suicide in Oregon, the decision to request and use a  prescription for lethal medication was associated with concern about loss of  autonomy or control of bodily functions, not with fear of intractable pain or  concern about financial loss. In addition, the choice of physician-assisted  suicide was not associated with level of education or health insurance  coverage.
