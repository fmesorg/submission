				<h4>Unmodified ECT: what is the patient's perspective?</h4>
				<p>
					Raval has correctly  indicated that, when prescribing a treatment, it is necessary to be aware of  the views of the recipients of the treatment. There is much literature on  patients' experiences with and attitudes towards modified ECT in developed  countries <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freeman CPL, Kendell RE. ECT: Patients' experiences and attitudes to ECT. J Psychiatry 1980;137:8-16." id="1">(1,</a><a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Benbow SM. Patients' views on electroconvulsive therapy on completion of a course of treatment. Convulsive Ther 1988;4:146-152." id="2">2)</a> as well as in India <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Mariadas B, Kalanidhi K, Reddy MV. Patients' knowledge about and attitudes towards ECT. Paper presented at the 45th Annual National Conference of the Indian Psychiatric Society, Lucknow, 1993." id="3">(3)</a>. There is, unhappily, no literature at  all on patients' experiences with and attitudes towards unmodified ECT in any  part of the world; in fact, it is uncertain whether, today, unmodified ECT is  indeed practised in any other country!
				</p>
				<p>
					Data on the subject should help form a more sound judgement about unmodified  ECT. Unfortunately, such data are best obtained only through a study in which  patients are randomised to receive either modified or unmodified ECT. If the  data were to be obtained in any other way, adherents of unmodified ECT would  claim that, in the absence of a control group, the experiences and attitudes  documented merely reflect experiences with and attitudes towards ECT in  general.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raval additionally suggests that the practice of unmodified ECT may fuel the  fears of patients who see ECT portrayed as a gruesome and barbaric treatment by  the visual mass media. With apologies to Shakespeare, the fault, dear Brutus,  lies not in unmodified ECT, but in its distorted portrayal. For example, an  open heart surgery is well known to result in short- and long-term cognitive  deficits; if the mass media were to use this knowledge to vilify open  heart surgery, would it be justifiable to abandon the procedure? Sadly, in  expressing his opinion, Raval is actually right. The strongest case for the  abandonment of unmodified ECT is that its continued use may provide grist to  the mill of publicity-hungry, self-important civil rights activists and  sensationalistic film producers, and thereby jeopardise the survival of ECT  itself.
