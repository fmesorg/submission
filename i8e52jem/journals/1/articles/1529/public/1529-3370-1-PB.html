				<h4>HIV/AIDS programme mismanaged</h4>
				<p>
				Critics  of India's ambitious World Bank-funded AIDS control programme feel vindicated  by the revelation in Parliament that the number of HIV-infected people in the  country has snowballed to eight million. Health activists and non-governmental  organisations have long protested against alleged mismanagement of anti-AIDS  funds. Anti-AIDS activist Purushottaman Mulloli thinks that current  donor-promoted H1V/AIDS programmes cannot work in India in the absence of an  effective primary health care system. The government's AIDS control efforts  have also come under fire for targeting "high-risk" groups, leading  to social ostracism of the group.</p>
				<p>Efforts will not get far without a change in  medical professionals' attitudes, say activists. <em>"Doctors remain unwilling  to work with HIV positive people while society reacts with paranoia as the  epidemic unfolds"</em>,  complains Siddharth Vatsyayan of the AIDS Awareness Group. According to John  Roegner of the NAZ Foundation (India Trust), hospitals and doctors in the  Indian capital regularly turn away AIDS patients.

				<h4>Government doctors  banned from conference</h4>
				<p>
			    <em>Israel 's health  minister banned 200 public JLsector doctors from attending a conference in  Turkey, organised and paid for by Teva, Israel's leading pharmaceutical  company. He argued that the trip was aimed at promoting sales of a new  anti-hypertension drug, Cardura-XL, which Teva markets in Israel for Pfizer,  and would have violated "public and ethical considerations."</em></p>
				<p><em>Teva  said that it had acted within government guidelines. The company was forced to  cancel the conference and is considering legal action against the ministry.</em></p>
				<p><em>The  health ministry issued guidelines in 1993, but the director general. Professor  Gabi Barabash, said: "There are loopholes that have to be closed.

				<h4>IMA acts against sex  selective abortions</h4>
				<p>
				Tne Indian Medical  Association and the Medical Council of India have asked doctors to stop  participating in sex determination and selective abortion of female fetuses.  The IMA will circulate a set of directives to all its 1,700 branches. It has  said that it will launch independent investigations against doctors suspected  of being involved in such practices. The medical council has promised to revoke  licences of doctors found guilty.</p>
			  <p>This is the first time since the Indian  parliament outlawed prenatal sex determination that medical institutions are  trying to step up pressure on doctors. Not a single doctor has been convicted  under the 1994 act. </p>
				<p>
				Non-government  organisations such as the Voluntary Health Association of India estimate that  hundreds of thousands of foetuses are aborted each year only because they are  female. The practice has spread across urban and rural India through easy  access to non-invasive sex determination based on ultrasonography.</p>
				<p>Social  activists and legal experts, however, are sceptical. <em>"This is a situation  where there is social sanction to an outlawed practice,</em>" says Anita Roy, a  federal police officer.

				<h4>WMA opposes national  health database</h4>
				<p>
				<em>The World Medical  Association (WMA) I council meeting in Santiago, Chile. affirmed its support of  the Icelandic Medical Association in its fight against the implementation of a  national health database in Iceland. </em></p>
				<p><em>
				  In  December 1998 Iceland passed legislation providing for the creation of a  national health sector database covering the country's population. Patients had  untilJune 17 to opt out the database, which would allow a private company to  link their medical records with genealogical and genetic data.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
				  The WMA  council said that it stood fully behind the position taken by the Icelandic  Medical Association in opposing the legislation, and it especially wished to  point to the need to protect the integrity of patient data and have open access  to all scientific data. The council is urging all national medical associations  and governments to ensure that science is furthered by continued research  without breaching medical ethics and patient confidentiality.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
			    The  Icelandic government has defended the development of the database on the  grounds that patients' rights of confidentiality are fully protected and that  rights to develop new drugs or lest candidate drugs are not being given  exclusively to one company. Icelandic health authorities will have access to  the scientific information, provided that they comply with specific  regulations.</em> </p>

				<h4>Investigation into  mental hospitals</h4>
				<p>
				The National Human  Rights Commission (NHRC) has constituted a central advisory group to look into  the functioning of the Ranchi, Agra and Gwalior mental hospitals. The hospital  managements came under the scrutiny of the supreme court through a writ  petition. In a November 1997 order, the apex court asked the NHRC to involve  itself in the supervision of the functioning of these mental hospitals in the  same manner in which the Commission was requested to undertake similar work in  respect of the Agra Protective Home.</p>
				<p>The NHRC has set up a central advisory  group headed by the NHRC's chairman, justice MN Ventatachalaiah. to advise the  Commission on the duties and responsibilities envisaged by the supreme court's  order, the various steps to be taken to achieve these objectives and to review  the progress of work. </p>

				<h4>WHO guidelines  questioned</h4>
				<p>
				The May 1999 issue of  the Bulletin on Drug and Health Information carries an open letter to the  director of WHO, questioning WHO guidelines which specify normal blood pressure  as below 130/85 mmHg, and optimal blood pressure as below 120/80 mmHg. It notes  that the only trial looking at optimal blood pressure contains "no  evidence to recommend aiming for a blood pressure below 140/90 in  non-diabetics". The trial was co-sponsored by the WHO and Astra, a  pharmaceutical company.</p>
				<p>The letter adds: "We fear that the new  recommendations will be used to encourage an increased use of anti-hypertensive  drugs, at great expense, and for little benefit." The letter, which was  written by Therapeutics Initiative, a group of Canada-based family doctors,  can be signed on the Internet at http://www.uib.no/isf/letter/index.htm.

				<h4>Delinquent Maharashtra  doctors face action</h4>
				<p>
					Over 250 medical  officers in Maharashtra face civil and criminal proceedings for dereliction of  duty following a state government directive to the director of health services.  This followed a department survey revealing that many medical officers attached  to the public health centres, rural and district hospitals had left the  headquarters without their superiors' written permission. They were also found  carrying out private practice in blatant violation of Maharashtra Civil Service  rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under section 168 of the Indian Penal Code, a public servant unlawfully  engaged in a trade is liable to simple imprisonment for a term which may extend  to one year or with a fine or both. Medical officers drawing non-private practicing  allowance are barred from private practice. <em>"We found that while the  doctors were not reporting to the public health centres, they were actually  seeing patients at their official residence and collecting money from poor  patients. In some cases, a section of the medical officers were running  full-fledged nursing homes in the names of their relatives"</em>, an  officer said. The state is also considering the suspension of registration of  the erring officers. Specific instructions have been issued to the director of  health services that the salary bill of medical officers who leave the  headquarters without permission should be withheld.

				<h4>SA doctors against  unethical colleagues</h4>
				<p>
				<em>A group of South African  doctors from the University of Cape Town's Health and Human Rights project is  considering forcing the Health Professions Council to investigate the doctor  who headed the apartheid government's chemical and biological warfare programme.  They are also asking the council to lake action against doctors implicated in  unethical conduct before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </em></p>
				<p><em>
				  Dr  Wouter Basson is being tried for crimes associated with his role at the head of  the programme. At present, he retains his job in the public health sector as a  cardiologist. The Health Professions Council says it will conduct an inquiry  into his conduct after the criminal trial. The South African Medical  Association, the voluntary professional association for doctors, has allowed Dr  Basson to remain a member but has initiated an investigation into his  membership.

				<p><em>
				  Among  those who have now complained to the council is Professor Joe Veriava, who was  instrumental in compelling the council to inquire into the death of the  political activist Sleven Biko. Up until that time the council had refused to  take action against the doctors who attended to Mr Biko after he was fatally  assaulted while in police custody.

					<strong>Babies  to order in the US</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>British couples desperate for a family are spending tens of thousands of pounds  on perfect babies-to-order. Faced with two-year waiting lists in the UK, they  are selecting their ideal offspring from advertisements on the Internet and  travelling to the US for treatment. The business is attracting those who fear  that a shortage of egg donors in this country may force them to remain  childless. </em></p>
				<p><em>
				  Fertility  experts believe what the number of Britons using US facilities will rise  dramatically because the Net has made information on donors so accessible.  Parents are choosing the genes they want their child to inherit.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
				  An  Indian couple asked a clinic for an egg from a Caucasian mother; a dark-skinned  woman asked specifically for a tall Nordic donor. The sale of eggs is big  business in America. While the British system pays a donor only &pound;15 plus  expenses, market economics operates in the US and genes can fetch high prices.  In Britain, doctors insist that the donor must be close to the would-be  parents' own genetic backgrounds. If the couple ask for a donor very different  from themselves, most doctors will question whether they will make suitable  parents.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
				  In the  US, agencies advertise for eggs in student newspapers at Ivy League  universities. Up to $50,000 is offered for preferred characteristics. Some US  egg donor agencies advertise directly on the Internet with soft-focus  photographs of their donors on the web.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
				  The  donation procedure itself is complicated and while the process does not deplete  the donor's reserve, it can be painful and sometimes leads to hyper  stimulation, and in rare cases, stroke.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
			    James  Yeandel of the UK's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said,  "The number of people searching the Internet for egg donors is alarming,  but I think the cost will be prohibitive for most British couples." The 68  licensed clinics in Britain charge about &pound;3000 per cycle; US clinics at least  three times that.</em> </p>

				<h4>Protest against ruling on HIV marriage</h4>
				<p>
				Lawyer Anand Grover called for public protest against the Supreme Court ruling  suspending the AIDS-affected person's right to marry. He said the right to  marry is a fundamental right and no court of law can 'suspend' it. The apex  court did not take cognisance of the fact that HIV-positive people get married  with full, free and informed consent of their partner who may or may not have  HIV positive status.</p>
				<p>"The restriction on the marriages of HIV-infected  persons can have serious repercussions. The isolation of such persons will  drive the epidemic underground, as doctors and hospitals will not maintain  confidentiality with regard to their HIV status," he said. He said the  apex court was right in making it a moral and legal right for an HIV-positive  person to disclose his/her status to the prospective spouse.

				<h4>Kidney on the net</h4>
				<p>
					Online  bidding for a human kidney topped US $5.7 million before executives at the  Internet auction house EBay yanked the illegal posting. <em>"Fully functional  kidney for sale"</em>,  read the posting. <em>"You can choose either kidney. Buyer pays all transplant and medical  costs. Of course, only one for sale, as I need the other to live. Serious bids  only"</em>.  Selling human organs is illegal in the United States, punishable by up to five  years in prison or a $50,000 fine. Ebay said it shut down the auction as soon  as the company heard of it. Nevertheless the auction appears to mark an  uncomfortable intersection of the frenzied atmosphere of Internet bidding, a  possible hoax and the desperate shortage of organ donors in the United States.  There are 42,907 patients waiting for kidney transplants in the United Slates,  according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. The average waif exceeds  three years. But experts said both the kidney offering and the seven bids it  fetched were probably hoaxes.

				<h4>Hypnotism to increase sperm count</h4>
				<p>
				A  doctor practicing hypnotism in Nashik recently created a flutter in medical  circles by claiming that his therapy had increased the sperm count in a  patient, who later fathered a child. The doctor's haste in going to town about  his success invited criticism and the attention of the medical fraternity,  which responded with scepticism. But the most practical response was from the  Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti, which asked the doctor for a public debate on  the issue.</p>
				<p>At the public meeting, the doctor cut a sorry figure and was not  able to give a satisfactory scientific answer to the 'miracle'. He made a  rather sheepish exit saying he would conduct the experiment on at least 200  patients and involve medical experts to establish his claim. </p>

The company  called the move to end five years of litigation a "pure business decision  ". It did not admit any wrongdoing. The settlement covers most of the  thousands of lawsuits filed against the company but not the claims by hundreds  of other women who had different types of injuries including scarring from  having the implants removed. The company has prevailed in most of its Norplant  lawsuits winning three verdicts, 20 summary judgments and the dismissal of  almost 14,000 claims.

				<h4>Hospital also liable</h4>
				<p>
				The  Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Dadar, Mumbai, has ordered the Lilavati  Hospital to pay S P Bhanushali Rs 1,25,489 as compensation in a case of  post-operative medical negligence, and held that the hospital is liable for  actions of its honorary doctors. If also defined what constitutes specialist or  expert care.</p>
			  <p>The complainant's father. Mr Padmakar Vaman Bhanushali. underwent  coronary artery bypass grafting at the hospital on October 31, 1997. On  November 3, he contacted Dr Panda because of a fever associated with rash and  chills, but no quick remedial action was taken. On November 7, he was examined  by one Dr D'Silva who asked him to undergo some investigations and stop the  drug Augmentin. He was subsequently admitted to Lilavati on November 11 after  liver function tests showed abnormal results, but died on November 12, 1997.  The cause of death was given as 'terminal cardiorespiratory arrest with blood  transfusion induced graft versus host reaction with ischaemic heart disease."</p>
			  <p>The court ruled: "A reasonable prudent doctor who professes to be an  expert in the field ought to have the patient immediately admitted,  investigated and more importantly, kept under close observation." That  this was not done "amounts to negligence."</p>
				<p>Although Dr D'Silva is not  a party in the case, the court ruled that the relationship of Dr Panda and  Lilavati hospital is "that of a principal and an agent and that of Dr  D'Silva and Lilavati Hospital is that of an employee and employer. By the law  of vicarious liability, therefore, for all acts of omission and commission of  the agent... the principal will be liable"

				<h4>NEJM editor steps down</h4>
				<p>
					In  August 1999, Jerome P. Kassirer, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of  Medicine, stepped down after a highly successful tenure of eight years, Dr  Kassirer's exit ended a long-standing struggle between him and the  Massachusetts Medical Society, which owns and publishes the NEJM. DrMarciu  Angel!, interim editor-in-chief of the NEJM, writes in the September 2. 1999  issue that the main bone of contention was the Society's "ambitious plans  to expand its role as a medical publisher, both in print and on line, by  launching and acquiring new publications, repackaging the Journal's content for  consumers, and entering into joint arrangements ('co-branding') with various  information-based commercial enterprises. Kassirer privately questioned the  wisdom of many of these ventures, but what he strongly opposed in his capacity  as editor-in-chief was the use of the Journal's name to promote products for  which he and Ins staff had no responsibility. To him. these activities  threatened the Journal's credibility. To the society's leadership and  publishing staff, such leveraging not only was good business practice, but also  furthered the society's educational mission."
