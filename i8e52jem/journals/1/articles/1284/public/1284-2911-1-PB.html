					"In Great Britain, as in many other parts of the  world, all medical research involving humans is subject to scrutiny by a local  research ethics committee (LREC). Local research ethics committees  provide independent advice to all bodies belonging to the National Health  Service (NHS) within the geographical area of a health district. They  sometimes also advise on studies not involving NHS patients, records or  premises, carried out by private sector companies, universities, or bodies such  as the Medical Research Council. Research ethics committees normally have  between eight and 12 members, drawn from both sexes and from a wide range of  age groups. They should include hospital medical staff, nursing staff,  general practitioners and two or more lay people. Ideally they will also  include a statistician and a pharmacist. If they do not, the chair of the  LREC will refer specific queries to a statistician or pharmacist based at the  hospital. Though members are drawn from groups with particular interests or  responsibilities in connection with health issues, LREC members are not  considered to be representatives of these groups. Members' broad range of  experience and expertise should allow for reconciliation between the scientific  and medical aspects of a research proposal, and the welfare of research  subjects and broader ethical implications <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Local Research Ethics Committees, REC(91)5, Department of Health." id="1">(1)</a>. In order to facilitate the  process of ethical review of multi-centre research, a system of multi-centre  research ethics committees (MRECs) was established in 1997 to complement the  work of existing LRECs. An MREC is responsible for considering all  multi-centre research that is health related where the research will be  conducted within five or more locations <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ethics Committee Review of Multi-centre Research, REC(97)23." id="2">(2)</a>. Most pharmaceutical company  sponsored research proposals will be submitted to an MREC. Only a  researcher who has received written MREC approval may go on to seek local REC  approval in the areas in which they wish to work. The LREC will only consider  issues that affect local acceptability and is otherwise bound by the MREC's  decision.

					The Centre of Medical  Law at King's College, London, is one of the main providers of training for  members of research ethics committees. It has for some time run a  three-day introductory course on the ethics of research on humans. This  course involves lectures and workshops covering ethical tools for reviewing  research proposals, different types of research methods including observational  and qualitative research, and randomised controlled trials. There are  also sessions on the development and licensing of medicines and the regulation  of the pharmaceutical industry's clinical trial activities, and the law  relating to consent, confidentiality and the running of a committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>It has become apparent  that there are aspects of healthcare research that can be particularly  problematical for members of research ethics committees. One of the most  difficult subjects for members of LRECs is that of research involving  vulnerable groups. These include children, the mentally ill, elderly people  and the dying.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to begin to  address this, the Centre of Medical Law and Ethics has recently set up a new  series of advanced study days, each concentrating on research involving one of  these vulnerable groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first study days was  on ethical issues in paediatric research. Participants were briefed by an  ethicist, a medical lawyer and a key member of the Royal College of Paediatrics  and Child Health on the ethical and legal issues involved in research on  children. These presentations were followed by case study work, in which  participants worked together to consider a number of fictitious ethical  dilemmas. They then had the opportunity to address questions to a panel  of experts. The panel included paediatricians, a parent of children  involved in medical research, a sociologist specialising in children's ability  to consent, a child psychiatrist, a research nurse from a children's hospital  and a clinical trials manager from a pharmaceutical company that produces a  number of drugs for children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though a number of the  issues raised are particular to a UK context, many of them are more universally  relevant and may be of interest to readers in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Royal College of  Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) regards research into children's diseases  as crucial in securing better evidence-based care for future children but  stresses that it should conform to the highest ethical standards <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guidelines of the ethical conduct on medical research involving children, RCPCH Ethics Advisory Committee, 2000." id="3">(3)</a>. Children  are acknowledged as having a unique physiological and psychosocial status and  are as equally deserving of evidence-based treatment as adults. The fact  that many medicines are not licensed for children renders them therapeutic  orphans <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sutcliffe Alastair G. Editorial, BMJ 1999; 19:70-71." id="4">(4)</a>. A child's vulnerability and need for protection should not be used  to prevent them benefiting from research which is therapeutically useful. It is  particularly important to establish that the lack of research is not purely  driven by commercial or indemnity-related concerns.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some parents might feel  morally obliged to contribute to therapeutic research which will benefit their  offspring, but this should be not be motivated by a disproportionate sense of  gratitude. Practitioners involved in the long-term care of children with a chronic  or life-threatening disease should be particularly aware of the impact of the  relationship between the team and the family, and the ways in which this might  influence parents' attitudes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Putting aside the legal  issues relating to consent, there is a moral requirement to involve a child as  much as is possible and/or appropriate in the consent process. This entails a  number of specific duties when there is the possibility that the child could  participate in a meaningful way. They include testing the individual child's  ability to participate in the consent process and proceed accordingly,  ascertaining the extent to which the child wishes to be involved in the  decision making process, discussing with the parents or guardians the extent to  which they are prepared to involve the child in the process and final decision  and providing information which will help the child to get a realistic sense of  what will be involved in participating without causing undue harm. The key to  success in gaining informed consent lies in effective communication between  researchers, families, associated professionals, professional bodies, LRECs and  MRECs, research councils, charities, drug companies and educational  institutions, and possibly parental or patient involvement in the design of the  project <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eckstein Sue. The advanced study day on ethical research. Dispatches October 2000; 10: 2-4." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					English law relating to  medical research on children is complex and uncertain and it is impossible to  state the law relating to this with complete certainty. There are no statutes  or legal cases that deal with research on children specifically. As a result,  it is necessary to identify the broad legal framework relating to children, and  to try to determine the implications of these principles in the area of medical  research. Inevitably, this involves a degree of speculation about how a judge  would deal with the issues if a case were brought to court.
				</p>
				<p>
					In England, the legal  framework for the care and upbringing of children (including issues of medical treatment) is mainly derived from the Children Act 1989. This is a very complex  piece of legislation, but there are at least three key aspects of the law which  are relevant to research involving children - parental responsibility, the  powers of the courts and children's rights. The power of children to consent to treatment is derived from the famous case of <em>Gillick</em><a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority [1985] 3 All ER 402, [1986] AC 112, House of Lords." id="6">(6)</a> (which established  that children with "sufficient understanding" could consent to medical  treatment without parental involvement). It is unclear whether this  principle allows children to consent to involvement in medical research. Even  if, in principle, children can consent to involvement in research, it is also  necessary to determine whether an individual child is competent to do so. The  General Medical Council has given guidance on assessing children's competence to  consent to medical <em>treatment</em><a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Medical Council. Seeking patients' consent: the ethical considerations, GMC, February 1999." id="7">(7)</a>. This guidance is consistent with the approach  to competence taken by the courts, but the courts have never considered the  level of competence that a child would need to demonstrate to make a decision  about medical research. An assessment would require consideration of the  child's specific circumstances, including age, maturity and experience, and  also the complexity of the research, and the consequences for the child of  involvement or non-involvement. However, in practice, researchers take a  cautious approach, and are likely to seek approval from both the child and the  parents, and not to involve the child in research if the child or the parents  are unwilling.
				</p>

				The RCPCH, in its two  recent guidelines <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guidelines of the Ethical Conduct on Medical Research Involving Children, RCPCH Ethics Advisory Committee, 2000." id="8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Safe-guarding informed parental involvement in clinical research involving newborn babies and infants. A position statement, RCPCH, December 1999." id="9">9)</a>, provides a series of questions which research ethics  committees should consider in assessing risks and benefits including the type,  nature, magnitude, probability, timing of risks or benefits; the fairness of  research to subjects and its effect on their future autonomy.
				<p>
					A number of other issues  arose out of the discussions. There were comments and questions on the  issue of consent by adults for children with special needs and on consent by  parents who themselves have a learning disability. There was a broad consensus  that there was a need for research with terminally ill children and discussion  on how LREC members, who would normally be averse to this, could be reassured  that such research can be ethical. There was a discussion on the extent  to which children should have an obligation to take part in research. For  example, parents may refuse to allow their children to participate in research  but want the benefits of gene therapy for their own children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Members of research  ethics committees are clearly very interested in receiving expert guidance to  assist them in their task of assessing protocols from an ethical  perspective. Other planned advanced study days will focus on ethical  issues in psychiatric research, ethical issues in research into diseases of  age, and ethical issues in palliative care. It is hoped that future days  will include ethical issues in research on neonates, in cancer-related  research, and in research on people in a persistent vegetative state or  coma."
				</p>
				<p>
					The more knowledge and  understanding that both researchers and members of research ethics committees  have of the difficult issues surrounding research involving people in these and  other groups, the more a healthy balance will be established between protecting  the interests of vulnerable participants and valuably expanding the research  base in these complex areas of health care.
