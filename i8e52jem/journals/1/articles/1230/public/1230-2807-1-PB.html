					<em>This section has been extracted from the chapter on  hospitals in Ahmedabad, and from the chapter on the medical profession, of  theMFC report.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Medico Friend Circle team interviewed camp inmates who  had accessed hospital services in Amdavad, staff and patients in hospitals, and  doctors working in various hospitals in Amdavad. The city's public hospitals  are run by the Amdavad Municipal Corporation (L G Hospital, V S Hospital, and  Shardaben Hospital) and the state government (two civil hospitals)..
				</p>

				<h4>Services by public hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Public hospitals have been working under a constant threat  of violence against Muslim patients within the precincts. Mobs have attacked  hospitals, prevented injured persons from entering their gates, and even  terrorised and attacked patients and relatives in the wards. The government has  made no serious efforts to protect health services and maintain people's access  to them. Still, health professionals have provided treatment without  discrimination on the basis of community. On the whole, comments from almost  all sources, including camp inmates, indicated that individual doctors in  hospitals have worked strenuously, often around the clock, to deal with the  large number of violence victims. <em><strong>The efforts of many committed doctors, nurses  and hospital staff to provide care to victims in a demanding situation must be  appreciated.</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					However, larger forces have restricted hospitals'  effectiveness in providing care especially to Muslims. <em><strong>The sanctity of hospitals  as humanitarian spaces, where everyone should be able to receive treatment  without fear, has been violated.</strong></em> Some doctors have been threatened for treating  minority patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ad hoc measures taken to deal with emergency situations  (segregating hospitals and patients on the basis of community, giving  sympathetic leave to Muslim staff) may threaten the secular character of health  institutions and lead to further polarisation within the profession. <em><strong>While  hospitals have largely been non-discriminatory, they have been unable to  mobilise support to protect their non-partisan and humanitarian  role.</strong></em> Responsibility for ensuring safety of hospital patients and staff lies  with state agencies which have been party to the violence themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Religion-wise segregation of hospitals</em>: A senior medical  consultant from a municipal hospital told the team that both hospital  authorities and the public segregate hospitals &mdash; informally &mdash; according to the  religion of patients to whom they generally provide services. Patients of the  'other' religion would be transferred to a 'safer' hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such segregation, accentuated during the recent violence, is  partly related to hospitals' geographical location and the ghettoisation within  the city. This has contributed to the public perception of each hospital as the  preserve of patients of certain communities. Hospitals in Hindu majority areas  are not frequently accessed by Muslim patients, and vice versa.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vadilal Sarabhai hospital is perceived as a 'safer' hospital  for Muslims. <strong>During the 1992</strong> communal violence, a Muslim burns patient admitted  in the LG Hospital was thrown off the hospital roof. The memory of that event  inhibited many from going there.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Mobs preventing Muslim patients access to  hospitals:</em> Patients, hospital staff and doctors all told the team of large mobs  gathering in front of some hospitals or in hospital compounds, especially  during the initial days after the outbreak of violence. The mobs intimidated  Muslims trying to bring new patients to the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospital authorities eventually started providing security  outside the hospital and even in some wards. However, patients often faced  barriers even trying to reach hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Threat of violence to patients within hospitals:</em> The team  also received reports that groups of 50 to 100 people, sometimes armed, would  in certain hospital wards, talk in violent language about people of the other  community, and create an atmosphere of fear. Both patients and staff reported  attempts to assault patients within the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team heard reports of Muslim patients being discharged  from hospital prematurely, apparently to ensure their safety. Such decisions  confirmed that even doctors perceived that patients and their attendants were  not entirely secure within hospitals. It would have been more appropriate for  authorities to ensure adequate security.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Impact on health professionals</h4>
				<p>
					On the whole doctors have acted professionally within a very  narrow definition of the word. <strong><em>While they have not actively discriminated  against any community, they have not made active attempts to safeguard the  rights of their patients or even their peers.</em></strong>The profession has also not tried  to contribute to the process of securing justice for survivors by documenting  medical evidence or highlighting the problems that victims have faced.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Doctors' participation in violence and polarisation within  the profession:</em> The team conducted several interviews with doctors in the public  and private sector, paramedical staff, and other health workers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some senior doctors reported that a certain section of  doctors had been drawn into right-wing organisations, and openly espoused their  ideology. It was clear that certain groups are trying to mobilise professionals  along religious lines. This could lead to greater polarisation within the  profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Certain medical professionals have also been involved in  propagating an ideology of hatred. As members of the Bharatiya Janata Party and  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, they have also been responsible, directly or indirectly,  for perpetrating grave injury to Muslims in Gujarat. They have played a role  that runs counter to their professional calling as physicians, and are a blot  on the medical profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pravin Togadia (VHP, International General Secretary), Jaideep  Patel (VHP, Joint Secretary, Chief), and Maya Kodnani (Member of the  Legislative Assembly, Naroda) are three medical professionals reported as being  directly involved in the carnage. Apart from making incendiary statements and  provoking violence, at least two have been reportedly named in police  complaints as assailants in different incidents in Naroda and Gomtipura in  Amdavad.Â  No cognisance has been taken of  their actions; nor has any medical association taken action against them.  Professional bodies, both statutory and voluntary, play an important role in  safeguarding the integrity of their members. Their failure to even comment on  the behaviour of members of their own fraternity is inexcusable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The passivity of professional bodies is indicative of much  more deep-rooted polarisation within professionals. One doctor reported that  the office bearers of the IMA in Godhra had stopped inviting Muslim doctors to  meetings of the local IMA. It is well known that certain medical associations  have political affiliations with right wing groups (National Medicos  Organisation, Amdavad Doctors' Forum).
				</p>
				<p>
					The Amdavad Medical Association (AMA, with 90 percent of  registered allopathic practitioners in Amdavad as its members) has not publicly  condemned the attack on doctors. The Amdavad Doctors' Forum (ADF) condemned  attacks on doctors only after Dr Amit Mehta, a Hindu doctor, was attacked,  though earlier other (Muslim) doctors had been attacked and their property  destroyed and they had faced physical attacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					The attack on Dr Mehta has received substantial publicity.  The ADF issued instructions to its Hindu members to stop practising in Muslim  areas. Some medical associations painted a picture of 'Hindu' doctors being  endangered merely by venturing into Muslim-dominated areas. Dr Mehta himself  opposes this generalisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team asked an AMA office bearer why the AMA had not  participated in relief work in the camps - unlike after the earthquake when it  had immediately sent a relief team. It was informed that there was a problem of  safety. The AMA office bearer reported that they had written to the state  government asking for security for Hindu doctors practising in Muslim areas,  and vice versa.
				</p>
				<p>
					The AMA office bearer asserted that 'no Muslim doctor has  been attacked in Hindu areas.' When confronted with a report that  establishments of some Muslim doctors had been destroyed, he replied that they  must have been damaged accidentally because they adjoined other Muslim  establishments; no one would deliberately destroy medical establishments. However, it is unlikely that medical establishments were accidentally  destroyed, or that they could not identified as medical establishments.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  striking that medical associations refuse to even acknowledge that attacks had  taken place on Muslim doctors and their property in mixed and Hindu-dominated  areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					One doctor interviewed, who had been associated with the  RSS, suggested that professionals may have drifted with communal forces because  they enable them to promote their interests; commercial interest, not political  commitment, guided doctors' actions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The medical profession has largely stayed away from communal  politics. Space has now been created for religion-based politics within the  profession. The profession's neutrality will be further damaged if communal  organisations provide professionals opportunities to expand their business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Neutrality and humanitarianism are the founding principles  of the medical profession. The team repeatedly heard these sentiments from the  medical association representatives interviewed. However, in practice it did  not find many attempts to uphold or re-assert these values.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Possibility of discrimination:</em> The team probed into some  complaints of discrimination against Muslim patients immediately following the  carnage, either while seeking treatment in hospitals or as patients in general  practice. Every violence survivor interviewed was asked about the treatment  received, the institution where it was received and the experience. Team  members interviewed survivors who had been treated immediately after the  attacks, largely in the government hospitals, but also in Al Amin Hospital,  Amdavad, and in some private nursing homes in Godhra.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team did not find any reports of blatant discrimination  or neglect. It was not able to conclusively establish discrimination on a large  scale, though there may have been instances by individual doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					During a visit to one of the camps, the team heard of  patients being refused admission in a municipal hospital, but this could not be  confirmed because the patients concerned were not present in the camp at the  time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team also spoke to several individual doctors. One  senior doctor serving in a public hospital held that there had been complete  polarisation in the medical profession. He spoke of a 'schizophrenia' within a  large section of the medical profession, whereby though their political views  were in support of Hindutva, they would continue to treat Muslim patients  professionally. He felt that it was unlikely that in their professional work,  this would lead to any negligence or discrimination. He had not heard of cases  of overt discrimination against Muslim patients in any public hospital. He said  health workers serving in public hospitals were 'frightened and confused' by  the situations in which they had been placed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several doctors, from both communities, felt that there may  have been delays due to the rush of patients at the height of the violence, or  when doctors prioritised patients on medical grounds. These may have been  construed as deliberate acts by patients and their relatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the general atmosphere of terror surrounding the  hospitals, as well as the presence of Bajrang Dal and VHP activists within the  hospital premises, intimidated Muslim patients from approaching hospitals.  There also may have been a process of 'self-selection' wherein Muslim patients  avoided going to hospitals or doctors known for their inclinations, who might  have treated them with discrimination.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Attacks on medical professionals</em> There have been several  documented attacks on health professionals and their homes, property and  establishments in the early part of the violence. Of these, only one attack, on  Dr Amit Mehta, in the Juhapura area of Amdavad, received publicity in the  national press. The team received a press note prepared by the Medicos Welfare  Society, which condemned attacks on doctors on behalf of doctors of the  minority community.
				</p>
				<p>
					The team interviewed Dr Mehta and Dr Sadiq Kazi. Dr Mehta  was stabbed by an unidentified person in his dispensary. Dr Sadiq's car was destroyed  by persons well known to him; he also had a narrow escape from a mob while  driving to Al Amin hospital. The mob set fire to a couple riding on a  two-wheeler just in front of him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both doctors blame individuals and not entire communities  for the attacks on them. Dr Sadiq categorically blamed the authorities for  letting the violence continue by not taking action against troublemakers from  both communities. Dr Sadiq continues to attend the nursing home outside which  his car was attacked, while taking many precautions. Dr Mehta does not want to  move his clinic from the area where he has been practising for years, but is  afraid to go back there, fearing attacks by fundamentalists from either side.  The danger to medical practitioners is real. However, there is no evidence that  entire communities have turned against them and would like to drive them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The interviews suggested that doctors from both communities  do not pay much attention to the religious background of the community in which  they set up practice. Their decisions are based largely on their assessment of  the client base, and the prospects of a profitable practice. More Hindu doctors  work in Muslim areas because there are very few Muslim doctors. Muslim doctors  have largely been involved in voluntary relief work. This has been interpreted  as a gesture of solidarity to their community, but they are also the only  doctors available in Muslim-dominated areas. Other doctors, both Muslim and  Hindu, live further away and are not able to reach their workplaces or the  camps.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was highlighted by the plight of Al Amin hospital,  which lists 92 doctors as giving voluntary time. Only 14 are Muslims and the  rest Hindus. However, after the riots, only four doctors are coming for duty -  two of them were Hindu and two Muslim. The others are absent because of the  insecurity actively propagated by communalists.
				</p>
				<p>
					The right of all people to work wherever they choose to  work, must be respected and protected. Any exodus of medical practitioners due  to real or perceived dangers based on their religion will inflict irreparable  damage to the profession. One cannot over-emphasise the role of medical  associations in protecting the interests of all their members.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Other losses suffered</em>: Several doctors working in mixed  communities reported that their patient load had decreased substantially  because their patients could not reach them. On the other hand, the few doctors  who lived and practised in Muslim-dominated areas were overworked.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Doctors and religious identity:</em> The targeting of doctors  based on their religious identity has changed the framework within which the  profession articulates its interests. It may make sense to talk of  security-related problems of 'Hindu' doctors in 'Muslim' areas, and of 'Muslim  doctors', and explain their actions and motives in these terms. But this is  divisive, and has long-term implications for the profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several Muslim doctors and other staff in public hospitals  were given sympathetic leave immediately following the violence of February 28  - even if they had not asked for it. One lab technician said that when she  reported for duty (in a public hospital in a Hindu-dominated area), she was  pressurised by her colleagues to take leave. They felt her presence would  incite trouble and pose a danger to herself as well as to other staff and  patients.
				</p>

				<h4>Medico-legal issues</h4>
				<p>
					The team could not systematically investigate the quality of  medico-legal documentation but found evidence of several lapses. It is not  known if these were deliberate because they are common in normal times as well.  However, they have serious consequences for survivors' attempts to get  compensation and punish the guilty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eyewitness accounts have indicated that many rape victims  were subsequently burnt to death, destroying all physical evidence. Others fled  to camps immediately after the assault. Violence on the streets prevented them  from approaching a hospital for a medical examination (and the recording of  evidence), for which there were no facilities in the camps. In such cases,  physical medico-legal evidence of the assault no longer exists. In some cases,  doctors treating victims with obvious signs of sexual assault did not collect  the medico-legal evidence or record the case.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legal volunteers noted that though many of the deaths took  place in hospitals, dying declarations were rarely recorded. Most patients  would have been in a position to give a declaration after having received  life-stabilising treatment. However, neither the police nor hospital  authorities are pursuing this issue. A senior administrator in the municipal  corporation stated that at the height of the riots, when there were many  casualties, only identification of bodies was done, not post-mortems.
				</p>
				<p>
					The police is required to preserve the body for 72 hours,  during which period they may be identified and claimed by relatives. However,  the police disposed of bodies as 'unidentified' within a day of receiving them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the National Human Rights Commission has guidelines  for conducting post-mortem examinations. It does not appear that these  guidelines have been followed in large numbers of cases. In many cases post  mortems were not even conducted.
