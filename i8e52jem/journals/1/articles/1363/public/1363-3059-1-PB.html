					Although the false  incidence (children born with neural tube defects or NTD) and true incidence  (foetuses with NTD) of spina bifida is on the decline in the developed world,  the same cannot be said of spina bifida in developing countries. In a country  like India, the socioeconomic consequences of this malformation are  devastating. Because of their high incidence, problems related to antenatal  diagnosis and abortion, the quality of life decisions involved, lack of social  support structures, neglect of the girl child, lack of defined ethical  guidelines and a paucity of multidisciplinary clinics, NTDs pose some of the  greatest ethical challenges to the paediatric surgeon in India.Some years ago,  I was shocked to know that the parents of my patient - a third girl child with  meningomyelocele - had officially named her "Nakoshi" which means "unwanted".
				</p>

				<h4>Prevention</h4>
				<p>
					For most congenital  birth defects and especially for NTDs, the most ethical treatment would be  prevention. Unfortunately, this aspect has been largely neglected in India. No  proper epidemiological survey to determine the exact incidence of this anomaly  has been carried out so far. In many leading hospitals with fully established  obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatric surgery and radiology departments,  coordinated efforts are not made to diagnose this anomaly antenatally.  Estimation of maternal serum alpha-feto- protein is still not a routine  screening test in every pregnancy, though it is not a very expensive test. And  even if the mother of a child with spina bifida gets pregnant a second time,  there is no guarantee that she will be offered this test. It is still not  widely known that folic acid supplementation in the peri-conceptual period has  been accepted as a preventive measure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Attitudes and approaches</h4>
				<p>
					Ethically or morally, two opposite positions have been adopted in  relation to the treatment of such anomalies. On the one hand, the consumerist,  individualist and capitalist world seems to defend the 'right to live', while  on the other hand the non-consumerist,socialist societies are more ready to  adopt a practical, statistical approach and a belief in 'death with dignity'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those who believe strongly in the right to live would not agree with 'selection  of patients' for treatment. This group would probably also not agree on the  abortion of foetuses having NTDs. The case of this lobby was amply supported by  the famous 'Baby Doe regulations'. These regulations were laid down in 1985 in the  USA and stated that withholding care from these babies constituted  discrimination against the disabled and therefore was illegal. On the other  hand, many socialistic and welfare societies have thought that not just life  but quality of life is of greater importance, and judgements to that effect  have been delivered in their courts of law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Who decides what is best for the child? Should this be done by he doctor,  social worker, parents, lawyer, nurse or the hospital ethics board? Many  persons are concerned with the welfare of the child, but who decides what is  best for the baby? In a country like India, ethically it is necessary that the  decision be left to the parents because it is they alone who will have to bear  the entire responsibility for the future needs of the child. In societies with  advanced and established social support structures the decision making tends to  shift from the parents into the hands of ethics boards and lawyers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Family autonomy</h4>
				<p>
					We have said that in India it is perfectly ethical to leave critical  treatment decisions to parents but respecting family autonomy does not mean  leaving the parents alone in the decision-making process. They must be properly  guided. On many occasions these discussions with parents are done by the  junior- most doctor in the department. This task should be performed by senior  personnel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical issues to be considered before the birth of a child with spina bifida  are: antenatal diagnosis, abortion and peri-conceptual vitamins. After birth,  ethical questions such as selection criteria for treatment, the use of costly  investigations, the question of euthanasia, and having a second child are  important. We have already discussed antenatal diagnosis and the need for more  efforts towards prevention.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Selection criteria</h4>
				<p>
					During the 1970s, clinicians who were more aggressive in attempting to  treat infants born with anomalies began proposing selective treatment criteria.  Dr. John Lorber was the first to use diagnostic indicators to propose  guidelines about which infants with meningo-myelocele should be treated  aggressively at birth. Although selection of patients for treatment is  ethically acceptable, in many centres the manner in which this selection is  done is unethical. To select patients without well defined and uniformly  applied criteria is unethical. It is therefore an ethical requirement that each  institution which handles children with meningo-myelocele debates and lays down  proper guidelines for patient selection. The Indian Association of Pediatric  Surgeons (IAPS) can play an important role in this context, by forming a  working group to formulate these guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order of priority my protocol gives importance to the following criteria in  selecting patients for treatment.
				</p>
				<h5>Predicting ambulation:</h5>
				<p>
					The single most important criterion is whether the child will be able to  walk without help from anyone. This can be predicted by assessing power in the  hip and knee joints. By and large, if the both hips are normal (even without  power in the knees) then the child can walk with support (crutches). If the  hips are affected then the child will have to be confined to a wheelchair, and  in India a wheelchair life is extremely difficult and the individual still has  to depend on others.
				</p>
				<h5>Family support:</h5>
				<p>
					Here, we must consider the parents' educational status, family income, and  their degree of willingness to shoulder responsibility for the child's  treatment and care.
				</p>
				<h5>Other disabilities:</h5>
				<p>
					Spinal deformities, severe hydrocephalus, and other disabilities can  influence the decision to select a child for aggressive treatment. In our  protocol, we do not consider urinary or bowel incontinence to be a serious  handicap because we now have the experience and expertise to successfully  manage both these problems at least up to a level where they will not interfere  with the patient's daily life.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Expensive investigations</h4>
				<p>
					Should they be done in all patients? In recent years CT scans and MRIs  have become available in most cities in India. However, they are still very  expensive tests and are beyond the reach of many. In this context, it is again  unethical to advise these tests in every case of meningomyelocele that is  treated. In deciding when and which imaging tests should be advised, it is  ethically acceptable to apply the statistical approach to this problem. In our  centre, based on previous statistics we have found that there is a high  likelihood of having intraspinal lesions in cases of lipomeningoceles and thus  I would get a MRI done in all these cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly in cases where  there is almost total paraplegia the intraspinal findings are not going to have  any significant or immediate effect on the ultimate outcome and thus expensive  imaging techniques are not necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another approach that I have found very useful in difficult situations is:  "Would I do it on my child?" Unfortunately, in today's scientific and positivist  environment the ethical assumption frequently is that using existing technology  in the hope of preserving biological life is always a good worth pursuing.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethical care is comprehensive care</h4>
				<p>
					Lastly, no care which is incomplete and inadequate can be considered  ethical. For most children born with this dreadful condition, the complete  medical and social care that they require is rarely available. Very few centres  (maybe just two in the entire country) run specialised spina bifida clinics.  These clinics must be muliti-disciplinary in nature and must liaise with social  support organisations and schools. Again, the IAPS can play an important role  in guiding centres in establishing such clinics and working out the precise  costs involved and the infrastructure required.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have only highlighted in brief the important practical ethical issues that  arise when we treat patients of NTDs in India. An enormous effort is required  to change the future for these children but the socioeconomic gains of this  effort will be equally enormous.
