					In recent years, there  is increasing pressure on academia to develop links with industry and to pursue  work of possible commercial value. This pressure results in situations with  ethical problems, such as recruitment practices in clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Safeguarding participants in clinical trials Lancet 2000 355:2177" id="1">(1)</a>, impact  on publication of clinical trial data <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nathan DG, Weatherall DJ: Academia and industry: lessons from the unfortunate events in Toronto Lancet 1999 353:771-2" id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T: Uneasy alliance: Clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry N Engl J Med 2000 342:1539-44" id="3">3)</a>, and a shift in the focus of  research <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The patent craze and academia Lancet 1993 342:1435-6" id="4">(4)</a>. This article reviews the impact of commercial pressures on  publication of data from clinical trials.

				<h4>The conduct of clinical  trials</h4>
				<p>
					Clinicians study new  drugs for various objectives &mdash; benefit for their patients, to contribute to advances  in medical treatment, the prestige of publication, financial benefits, to  attract high quality applicants to their departments, and the opportunity to  travel abroad and meet leaders in other countries <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freestone DS, Mitchell H: Inappropriate publications of trial results and potential for allegations of illegal share dealing BMJ 1993 306:1112-4" id="5">(5)</a>. These are accepted as  legitimate benefits of the skills, experience and energy they commit to the  work. Until recently, academic clinicians played a key role in the design and  conduct of clinical trials. With the increasing cost of developing a new drug  (estimated at US$300-600 million), and the need to bring new drugs into market  rapidly, the industry's desire to expedite clinical trials has led to a  diminishing role for individual academic clinicians in the conduct of clinical  trials, and the expansion of control from industry medical departments and  contract research organisations (CROs). Today, the industry controls all  aspects of the trial from trial design and recruitment rate of participants to  data analysis and preparation oaf publication.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Publication guidelines  and policies</h4>
				<p>
					Every company follows  its own written publication policy, which covers the company's intent to  publish the results as a multi-author, multi-centre trial. Companies generally  insist on reviewing the article before publication. The investigator must wait  for almost a year for publication till the company reviews and analyses trial  results. The list of authors may not include investigators who do not recruit  the minimum agreed number of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Industry associations  support this publication policy. In the UK, the guidelines of the Association  of British Pharmaceutical Industry maintain that clinical trial results may be  confidential to a company or intended for publication and that "it should  always be the intention to publish where warranted." The clinical investigator  does not seem to have any responsibility in this <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Munro AJ: Publishing the findings of clinical research BMJ 1993 307:1340-41" id="6">(6)</a>. The guidelines for good  clinical practice (GCP) of the International Conference on Harmonisation do not  cover publication as a responsibility of the investigator or sponsor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Declaration of  Helsinki suggests: "In publication of results the physician is obliged to  preserve the accuracy of results". The Royal College of Physicians report  concludes: "It is however the responsibility of the investigators to ensure  that there is prior agreement with sponsor that the results of the research may  be submitted to journals of investigator's choice and the sponsor will not seek  to influence the publication of the results of the research" It further adds  that "it is unacceptable in principle that the investigators should agree to  conditions that may prohibit or impair the chances of publication although some  delay may sometimes be acceptable". <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Munro AJ: Publishing the findings of clinical research BMJ 1993 307:1340-41" id="6">(6)</a>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Potential problems</h4>
				<p>
					For academic  investigators, publication in peer-reviewed journals is the coin of the realm.  Pharmaceutical firms are more concerned with the approval of new-drug  applications from the FDA. Yet publication in prestigious journals is  important, to persuade physicians to prescribe the company's products.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some multi-centre trials  have publication committees, which may be dominated by in-house or outside  investigators who write up the results for publication. In other cases, the  company or CRO writes the reports for publication, circulating draft  manuscripts to the investigators who will be listed as authors. Authorship may  be determined by such criteria as who participated in designing the study, who  enrolled the most patients, and who has a prominent name in the field <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T: Uneasy alliance: Clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry N Engl J Med 2000 342:1539-44" id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many academic medical  centres review contracts between industry and investigators, insisting on the  investigator's right to publish the trial's results and allowing the company  prepublication review, with a time limit of 60 to 90 days. It is estimated that  30 to 50 percent of contracts submitted by companies have unacceptable  publication clauses that must be renegotiated <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T: Uneasy alliance: Clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry N Engl J Med 2000 342:1539-44" id="3">(3)</a>. Chalmers argues that the  results of many clinical trials are never published at all <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chalmers I: Underreporting research is scientific misconduct JAMA 1990 263: 1405-8" id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Individual investigators  who want to inform other clinicians about significant findings such as safety  or lack of efficacy face a long drawn-out battle. Betty Dong, who found that  her sponsor's brand was not more effective than a generic version, was  prevented by the company from publishing her results for nearly seven years.  The article was finally published after pressure from the lay press and the US  FDA <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rennie D: Thyroid storm JAMA 1997 277: 1238-43" id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nancy Olivieri and  associates found that a new drug for thalassemia major could worsen hepatic  fibrosis. The sponsor threatened legal action if she published the results.  Olivieri did present her findings at several scientific meetings and later in  referred journals, despite severe pressure from the company. She was not  supported by the hospital or university through this difficult period <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nathan DG, Weatherall DJ: Academia and industry: lessons from the unfortunate events in Toronto Lancet 1999 353:771-2" id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even where there is no  conflict, companies' commercial interests delay publication <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Blumenthal D, Causino N, Campbell E, Louis KS: Relationships between academic institutions and industry in the life sciences - an industry survey N Engl J Med 1996 334: 368-73" id="9">(9</a>, <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wadman M: Commercial interests delay publication Nature 1996 379:574" id="10">10)</a>. According  to a survey of 210 US companies, sponsors often require scientists to keep  their results secret longer than the patent procedure requires.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fifty-eight per cent of  the companies in this survey said they typically require university researchers  to refrain from publishing results for at least six months in order to file  patent applications. (The US National Institutes of Health requires that its  researchers keep results confidential for 30-60 days while patent applications  are filed.) Fifty-six per cent admitted that their university-supported  research often or sometimes generated information that was kept secret beyond  the time required to file a patent. Such information included experimental  methods, plans for future experiments, gene products, gene sequences and gene  location.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are also examples  of articles whose publication was stopped or whose content was altered by the  funding company or company requesting detailed revisions that would have made  the manuscript more favourable to the company's official marketing position <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T: Uneasy alliance: Clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry N Engl J Med 2000 342:1539-44" id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scenario in India is  unlikely to be different. Since the introduction of Schedule Y of drug rules in  1988, a Phase III clinical trial is mandatory before the company can obtain  registration of a new drug in India <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bolar H, Bhatt A: India in International Pharmaceutical Registration Ed AA Chalmers Interpharm Denver, Colorado 2000 p 193-203" id="11">(11)</a>. Over 300 new drugs have been  registered since then. However, the results of most of these trials remain  unpublished. Even if published, they are in non-peer reviewed journals. In such  a situation, there are unlikely to be reports of conflicts between the  investigator and industry.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Single centre  publication of a multi-centre trial</h4>
				<p>
					One of the unsettled  issues in multi-centre clinical drug trials is whether single centres should  publish their results independently. Stiller and Mehrel have commented: "We do  the scientific community and the public a disservice if we deny them rapid  access to potentially important new data, if we require our colleagues to wait  until a bureaucracy stumbles through all the cumbersome steps that inevitably  delay publication" <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stiller MJ, Mehrel T: Multicenter clinical drug trials: Should single centers publish their results independently? J Amer Acad Dermatol 1992 27:646" id="12">(12)</a>. In fact, the results of less successful multi-centre  studies may never be published if an individual investigator does not take the  initiative. The medical community has the right to know negative results as  well as the more frequently reported successes. Without this information, time  and money may be wasted in resuming the same unsuccessful clinical trial.
				</p>
				<p>
					The statistical dilemma  is whether results from a single centre in multi-centre trials will be  misleading or non-representative. The science of statistics is sophisticated  enough to minimise over-interpretation of data, unless an investigator or  statistician misrepresents, misinterprets, or overlooks significant data <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stiller MJ, Mehrel T: Multicenter clinical drug trials: Should single centers publish their results independently? J Amer Acad Dermatol 1992 27:646" id="12">(12)</a>.  However, the current practice does not encourage a single centre publication of  a multi-centre trial.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Medical journals and  publication of trials</h4>
				<p>
					At present, most  journals require authors of original articles to disclose any financial ties  with companies that make products discussed in papers submitted to the journal.  Recently, the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine found that the  financial ties of the authors of a study were so extensive that it would have  used too much space to disclose them fully in the journal! Ultimately, the  journal summarised them and provided details on their web site <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Angell M: Is academic medicine for sale? N Engl J Med 2000 342:1516-8" id="13">(13)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, editors often  have a limited understanding of issues arising out of the relationship between  authors and sponsors. In a mail survey of editors of 12 major medical journals,  nine requested such a disclosure. Only four inquired about publication rights  of the author; only one knew whether the sponsor's written approval was  required prior to manuscript submission; only one knew whether the sponsor  could delay submission for other than patent reasons; and only one knew whether  there was an independent steering committee for the study <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Schulman K, Sulmasy DP, Roney D: Ethics, economics, and the publication policies of major medical journals JAMA 1994 272: 154-6" id="14">(14)</a>. In India,  hardly any major journal insists on declaration of conflict of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Major international  journals publish clinical trials and also provide editorial comments. In  contrast, few clinical trials are published in peer-reviewed Indian journals.  This may reflect the lack of interest of authors and sponsors in publication,  or the scientific quality of the clinical trial, or the bias of editors and  referees against considering trials high quality research.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Clinical trial  investigators' financial bias and clinical trials'</h4>
				<p>
					Besides the industry,  the investigators also face allegations of commercial interest in clinical  trials. One aspect concerns trading in pharmaceutical company shares by  investigators who may have confidential information about the trial results.  This could result in premature or inappropriate communication of research results.  Investigators may enter patients who have borderline selection criteria into  studies, or fabricate results, or induce patients to enter by offering  remuneration or better medical care <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freestone DS, Mitchell H: Inappropriate publications of trial results and potential for allegations of illegal share dealing BMJ 1993 306:1112-4" id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					To win and retain their  clinical trial contracts with industry, investigators must find participants  and find them quickly. This pressure may lead to the adoption of questionable  practices. Doctors are paid substantial fees by sponsors to get their patients  to enroll in trials, which raises questions about conflict of interest. They  are also paid for opening their patients' confidential records so recruiters  can hunt for eligible subjects. Patients are often unaware that their doctors  are paid to recruit them for trials <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Safeguarding participants in clinical trials Lancet 2000 355:2177" id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is considerable  evidence that researchers with ties to drug companies are more likely to report  results favourable to the sponsor's products than are researchers without such  ties <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T: Uneasy alliance: Clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry N Engl J Med 2000 342:1539-44" id="3">(3)</a>. The US FDA is concerned about such bias, and insists on disclosure of  all financial arrangements between the investigator and the company.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The Indian perspective</h4>
				<p>
					With the patent regime  only five years away, several Indian companies have stepped up their efforts to  develop new drugs. The estimated cost of drug development is Rs. 150 crore,  which is less then one-tenth the international cost. Indian companies' focus of  new drug research &mdash; asthma, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes and cancer &mdash;  is similar to multinational efforts. Competitive global pressures on Indian  companies will create the need to expedite drug development time.
				</p>
				<p>
					India is keen to promote  itself as an international centre for clinical trials, emphasising its large  pool of well-trained doctors and the ready availability of trial subjects. The  government believes that clinical trials could become a significant source of  foreign investment. However, concerns have been expressed that the Indian  population, with its enormous genetic diversity is in danger of being exploited <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Scrip No 2547 June 9, 2000" id="15">(15)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clinical trials are the  most expensive part of the total cost of any new drug before it hits the  market. As global clinical trials come to India, trial costs will go up with  the need to adhere to GCP guidelines, the participation of international CROs  and the use of an international central laboratory for monitoring. A clinical  trial in a chronic disease requiring frequent laboratory monitoring and GCP  monitoring, and involving a CRO, would cost approximately US$ 5,000 per  patient. This is more than five times the current cost of a Phase III trial in  India for registering a new drug. Of course, this is still cheaper than it  would be in the USA or Europe.
				</p>
				<p>
					International clinical  trials will help Indian investigators improve the infrastructure of their  centres and get international exposure. Besides, investigators in private  set-ups are also able to earn for their time and responsibility. However, as  all trials have deadlines, there is pressure on the investigators to expedite  recruitment of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1999, several  multinational and Indian companies filed 24 investigational new drug (IND)  applications with the Drugs Controller General of India, of which 17 have been  referred to the Indian Council of Medical Research. This was a significant jump  from the six IND applications in 1998. Research and development for new drugs  and Indian involvement in global clinical trials is in evolution. Once this  picks up momentum, we will face a variety of ethical issues.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<p>
					The US Department of  Health and Human Services suggests that government should work with industry,  clinical investigators, and institutional review boards, to draw up guidelines  on recruiting practices <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Safeguarding participants in clinical trials Lancet 2000 355:2177" id="1">(1)</a>, and also strengthen government oversight of  institutional review boards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nathan and Weatherall  recommend, "In any agreement between a clinical scientist and the company, the  investigator should have the freedom to inform patients and the scientific  community about deleterious effects of agent or procedure under investigation" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nathan DG, Weatherall DJ: Academia and industry: lessons from the unfortunate events in Toronto Lancet 1999 353:771-2" id="2">(2)</a>. The hospital or university must immediately offer support to the investigator  in case the company takes legal action or harasses him. Similarly, the company  must have the opportunity to make its case when there is a disagreement with  the scientist. However, they should do so under the conditions of open  scientific debate, or at least with a panel of independent experts. The  scientific associations and journals must carefully investigate the origin of  research papers and to assure that the programme committees, chairman and  speakers do not have conflict of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Freestone and Mitchell  have proposed guidelines for investigators' investment. They advise that  clinical investigators (and their immediate relatives) should not buy or sell  shares in pharmaceutical companies whose share price might be affected by their  work until this is completed and results have been made public. They should not  disclose unpublished price sensitive results of studies in confidence to third  parties. Clinical investigators should make a voluntary declaration to ethics  committees and to sponsors of any share holding for which there might be a  conflict of interest and undertake not to trade in the relevant company's  securities until the studies are completed and the results made public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lower research costs and  the availability of drug-naive patients encourages the trend to do more trials  in developing countries like India. There is an urgent need for the Indian  research community, ethics committees, investigators, regulators and national  research organisations to discuss the above issues and develop Indian  guidelines.
