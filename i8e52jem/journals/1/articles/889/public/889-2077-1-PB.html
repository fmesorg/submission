					India is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Supreme Court held that Article 21 of the Constitution of India in relation to human rights has to be interpreted in conformity with international law <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="People's Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India (1997) 1 SCC 301." id="1">(1)</a>. Further, Article 25 [2] of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 (b) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have been cited by the Supreme Court while upholding the right to health by a worker <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ESC Ltd v. Subhash Chandra Bose (1992) 1 SCC 441 at 462." id="2">(2)</a>.

					These covenants find statutory acceptance in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. In addition, human rights commissions are empowered to study treaties and other international instruments on human rights and make recommendations for their effective implementation <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapter III, Section 12 (f) of The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993." id="3">(3)</a>.

				<h4>The Constitution of India on the right to health care</h4>
				<p>
					The Constitution incorporates provisions guaranteeing everyone's right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees protection of life and personal liberty to every citizen. The Supreme Court has held that the right to live with human dignity, enshrined in Article 21, derives from the directive principles of state policy and therefore includes protection of health <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (AIR 1984 SC 802)." id="4">(4)</a>. Further, it has also been held that the right to health is integral to the right to life and the government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State of Punjab v. Mohinder Singh Chawla (1997) 2 SCC 83." id="5">(5)</a>.

				<p>
					Failure of a government hospital to provide a patient timely medical treatment results in violation of the patient's right to life <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal (AIR 1996 SC 2426 at 2429 para 9)." id="6">(6)</a>.

Ram Lubhaya Bagga (1998) 4 SCC 117." id="7">(7)</a>.
