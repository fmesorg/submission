				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The recent negative media reports on the status of participants
					in clinical trials in India, together with the concerns expressed by
					the regulatory bodies, have raised questions regarding India's
					credibility in the conduct of clinical research. Even though the
					regulations require the registration of trials with the Clinical Trial
					Registry &ndash; India and despite the recently mandated registration of
					ethics committees (ECs) with the Drugs Controller General of India,
					the lack of governmental audit and accreditation procedures
					and bodies has resulted in inadequate protection of human
					participants in clinical research. Institutions and research sites
					would benefit by implementing a human research protection
					programme, which would safeguard the rights, safety and wellbeing
					of participants in clinical trials, in addition to improving the
					processes and procedures for the conduct of the trial. The Jehangir
					Clinical Development Centre, Pune has received accreditation
					from the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research
					Protection Programme (AAHRPP). A unique feature of the AAHRPP
					is the integrative nature of the programme, wherein the sponsors
					of the trial, investigators, EC members and institution work
					towards the common goal of protecting research participants.
					Here, we discuss the improvement needed in the quality standards
					of institutions for them to be able to meet the requirements
					of the AAHRPP. We also suggest the need for a governmental
					accreditation body, which will be required for the future promotion
					of and improvement in the standards for clinical practice in India.

				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					In the past two decades, India was a passive participant in
					most of the research on the development of new drugs, which
					constitutes a large proportion of the pharmaceutical research
					taking place <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ganju A. Clinical trials in India: should you or should you not participate? [Internet]. Available from: http://www.iscr.org/Resource/126681048_Clinical%20trial%20India.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. However, after signing the World Trade
					Organisation agreement in 2005 and becoming a party to the
					Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Act (TRIPS), India
					came on par with global destinations for the conduct of clinical
					trials. This, along with the availability of a large population of
					drug-naive patients, well-trained medical professionals and
					sophisticated technological infrastructure, has made India an
					attractive destination for the conduct of global clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Julka PK. Clinical trials in India: dilemmas for developing countries. Issues in Clinical Research. 2007 Apr:69&ndash;71." id="2">(2)</a>.
					The number of trials conducted across the country increased
					from a paltry 40&ndash;50 in 2003 to almost 1850 in 2011 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yee A. Regulation failing to keep up with India's trials boom. Lancet. 2012 Feb 4;379(9814):397&ndash;8." id="3">(3)</a>.
					However, as this trend developed , so have concerns regarding
					the ethical implications of outsourcing clinical trials to
					developing countries, because of the prevalence of poverty and illiteracy, as well as the lack of awareness <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatt A. Indian clinical trials: paradigm shift from speed to quality? Perspect Clin Res. 2012 Jan&ndash;Mar;3(1):1&ndash;3." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shah JY, Phadtare A, Rajgor D, Vaghasia M, Pradhan S, Zelko H, Pietrobon R. What leads Indians to participate in clinical trials? A meta-analysis of qualitative studies. PLoS One. 2010 May 20;5(5):e10730. doi: 10.1371/ journal.pone.0010730" id="5">5)</a>. The Indian media
					and regulatory bodies have been reflecting such concerns
					by stressing issues such as serious adverse events (SAEs),
					training and functioning of ethics committees (ECs), vulnerable
					patients, improper procedures for obtaining informed consent,
					and provision of compensation to participants in case of injury
					related to clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jadhav M, Bhatt A. Ethics in clinical research in India: A survey of clinical research professionals' perceptions. Perspect Clin Res. 2013 Jan&ndash; Mar;4:4&ndash;8." id="6">(6)</a>. In such a scenario, it is important
					for the stakeholders, ie the investigators, institution, EC and
					sponsors, to take their role in the research seriously, and to
					understand their responsibility for protecting the participants
					in the trial. They should try to ensure that the clinical research
					conducted by them is of the highest quality and meets the
					highest standards of ethics to safeguard the rights, safety
					and well-being of the participants. One way of promoting
					compliance with high standards is to implement a robust and
					comprehensive human research protection programme (HRPP).
					The objective of such a programme is that all the stakeholders
					should work towards ensuring that research is conducted
					ethically and that the data generated are credible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such a programme would include mainly policies, guidelines
					and written procedures to be followed while conducting and
					reviewing research involving human subjects. Under an HRPP,
					the researchers and research staff, EC, sponsors and research
					participants themselves would adopt a comprehensive and
					integrated approach towards the protection of human subjects
					of research. Another advantage of such a programme is that
					it would ensure research of good quality as the audits and
					inspections conducted in India are either random audits or
					for-cause audits by sponsors or regulatory agencies <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bairy KL, Pereira P. Accreditation of human research protection program: an Indian perspective. Perspect Clin Res. 2012 Apr&ndash;Jun;3:80&ndash;4." id="7">(7)</a>. The
					Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has recently laid down
					the norm that clinical trials should be monitored annually.
					However, this is still in the process of being implemented
					across the research sites in India. The DCGI has also mandated
					the registration of ethics committees with the governing body,
					in addition to the registration of individual trials with the
					Clinical Trial Registry &ndash; India (CTR-I). Nonetheless, the lack of
					governmental audit and accreditation procedures may put the
					credibility of research on human subjects in doubt.
				</p>

				<h4>Need for accreditation: Beyond quality assurance and
				quality control</h4>
				<p>
					The Jehangir Clinical Development Centre (JCDC), Pune is a
					clinical research site with rich experience in conducting Phase
					I to IV clinical trials across various therapeutic areas, including oncology, haemato-oncology, endocrinology, rheumatoid
					arthritis and neurology. JCDC was formed in 2006 and has
					conducted around 170 trials since, which makes it one of the
					most experienced investigator sites in India. It has a quality
					management system compliant with ISO 9001:2008 standard
					requirements in place. In 2012, an inspection of the organisation
					by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in
					relation to a clinical trial in haematology yielded no deviations.
				</p>
				<p>
					JCDC decided to go forward with an accreditation programme
					to improve upon its existing practices in the conduct of
					research and to demonstrate its ethical standards in the
					review and conduct of research. Applying for accreditation
					from the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research
					Protection Programme (AAHRPP), which is highly regarded,
					was an obvious choice because of the integrated nature of the
					programme, wherein the institution, investigators, EC, sponsors
					and research participants work towards the protection of the
					participants in research trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Organisations conducting research can benefit from
					accreditation from an internationally recognised body in that
					this helps them bring their procedures and policies on par
					with global standards. An organisation which has received
					accreditation is formally recognised to have the competence
					to carry out tasks within a specified scope, with the highest
					possible ethical and professional standards <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wadhwa V, Rai S, Thukral T, Chopra M. Laboratory quality management system: road to accreditation and beyond. Indian J Med Microbiol. 2012 Apr&ndash;Jun;30 (2):131&ndash;40." id="8">(8)</a>. While
					accreditation is voluntary and variable, it is now accepted
					worldwide as an important aspect of an organisation's internal
					activities pertaining to the improvement of quality <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Greenfield D, Braithwaite J. Health sector accreditation research: a systematic review. Int J Qual Health Care. 2008 June;20 (3):172&ndash;83." id="9">(9)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Journey to AAHRPP</h4>
				<p>
					To begin with, before applying for the accreditation, JCDC
					needed to have a thorough knowledge of the local regulations
					as well as the AAHRPP's requirements, which are categorised
					into three domains: (i) the organisation, (ii) the IRB/EC, and (iii)
					the researchers and research staff; they are further categorised
					into standards, which consist of various elements. A dedicated
					team consisting of key members from different departments
					of the organisation and EC members was set up to aid JCDC
					in conducting a gap analysis. The gap analysis was useful in
					identifying the procedures and areas which were deficient
					and which needed to be developed in accordance with
					the AAHRPP's requirements. The organisation then worked
					diligently on the findings of the analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the incorporation of all the changes made to the
					procedures in accordance with the AAHRPP's guidelines, the
					Step I application was sent to the AAHRPP's accreditation
					committee for a review process. The committee determines
					whether the written documents meet the accreditation
					standards. After reviewing the Step I application, the committee
					provided element-level feedback. Once the feedback was
					addressed and the changes were incorporated into the
					standard operating procedures (SOPs), a revised application
					was sent to the AAHRPP committee. After the changes were
					deemed satisfactory, JCDC submitted the Step II application.
					Its entire staff, including the EC members, investigators and research personnel, received training on the revised procedures.
					These procedures were then implemented. On dates agreed
					upon mutually, AAHRPP site visitors conducted site visit, during
					which they made a thorough assessment of the organisation's
					compliance with AAHRPP standards. The assessment consisted
					of reviewing the documents and interviewing selected key
					personnel from the organisation, including the investigators,
					EC members, and senior management and staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					The AAHRPP promptly sent a follow-up Draft Site Visit Report
					to the organisation. JCDC addressed the issues and concerns
					identified and sent the committee a response, which was then
					reviewed by the Council on Accreditation. On the basis of its
					overall preparedness, JCDC was awarded "full accreditation"
					status.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary changes made in the procedures included the
					following.
				</p>
				<h5>Domain I: Organisation</h5>
				<p>
					The AAHRPP standards in the domain of "organisation" required
					amendments to the existing SOPs. JCDC added new policies to
					its existing body of policies on and procedures for the ethical
					conduct of trials to ensure the safety of the participants. The
					organisation developed various tools, forms and checklists to
					complement the SOPs so as to be able to demonstrate effective
					implementation of the written procedures. Some examples of
					the changes made to the procedures are described below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The AAHRPP requires that sufficient activities be
						undertaken to enhance the understanding of human
						research among participants, prospective participants
						and their communities. JCDC developed a participant
						information brochure in the vernacular languages with
						the objective of educating participants on various aspects
						of clinical trials and their rights as research participants.
						The brochure also informed them about the organisation's
						HRPP, with the aim of helping them take a well-informed
						decision before participating in a clinical trial.
					</li>
					<li>
						For the English-speaking population, the organisation
						dedicated a section of its website, the "Participant Outreach
						Corner", to information on the participant's rights. This
						section also provided links to information on trials at the
						local and national levels, besides giving the participants a
						channel to provide their feedback, express their concerns
						and make complaints. JCDC also developed a policy for
						obtaining written feedback from research participants. The
						feedback questionnaires were in the vernacular languages
						so as to be able to better evaluate the participants'
						comprehension of informed consent, the quality of care
						received at the site and the facilities at the site. Policies were
						framed to facilitate corrective and preventive action in case
						of any negative feedback.
					</li>
					<li>
						The AAHRPP required the existence of a policy on the
						disclosure of conflict of interest to ensure that the conduct
						and outcome of trials are not biased by conflicting financial
						and/or non-financial interests of the investigator, EC members and key leaders of the organisation. A policy
						was framed to identify, evaluate, manage and minimise or
						eliminate JCDC's proprietary interests, financial investments
						or holdings, as well as the personal financial interests of key
						leaders of the organisation and investigators when such
						interests could conflict with the organisation's obligations
						to protect research participants, maintain the integrity
						of the research, and ensure the credibility of the human
						research protection programme.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the case of sponsored research, JCDC laid out criteria
						relating to clinical trial agreements and other funding
						agreements. Procedures were developed to ensure that not
						just the financial but also the legal aspects of the contracts,
						such as medical management in case of research-related
						injury and the maintenance of confidentiality, are reviewed
						and evaluated in detail, and are agreed upon by both
						parties before the submission of the initial application to
						the EC.
					</li>
					<li>
						An internal quality assurance (QA) department, which is
						an independent unit within JCDC, conducts routine audits
						and inspections to assess compliance with the protocol,
						applicable regulations, written SOPs, organisational policy
						and professional standards. It also identifies the strengths
						and weaknesses of the programme at the organisation, as
						well as opportunities to improve its quality, efficiency and
						effectiveness. Indicators for the measurement of quality
						were developed as required by the AAHRPP.
					</li>
					<li>
						JCDC framed a policy for the reporting of any unanticipated
						problem or event which might pose a risk to research
						participants or others, eg members of the research team
						and the public.
					</li>
					<li>
						Procedures were established so that the individuals
						responsible for oversight of research do not experience
						undue influence from the organisation or others.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Domain II: Institutional review board or ethics committee</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A comprehensive SOP was developed to incorporate all the
						requirements of the local regulatory bodies and AAHRPP.
						The SOPs documented the details of matters such as the
						composition of the EC, roles and responsibilities of the
						EC members, quorum requirements, use of consultants,
						and disclosure of conflict of interest of EC members.
						They also included systematic review procedures and
						documentations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tools and checklists were developed and implemented to
						demonstrate compliance with the SOPs.
					</li>
					<li>
						As per the local regulations, continuing review is required
						for every active trial. As per the AAHRPP's requirements,
						detailed procedures were laid down for continuing review
						of research studies to ensure complete review of the status
						of studies.
					</li>
					<li>
						JCDC introduced a procedure whereby the EC's approval of
						a research study would be valid for only a period of one year.
					</li>
					<li>
						Annual performance review of the EC members was
						commenced so as to bring more credibility to the
						functioning of the EC.
					</li>
					<li>
						Procedures were developed with respect to the disclosure
						of conflict of interest of the EC members to ensure unbiased
						and transparent procedures.
					</li>
					<li>
						A robust training programme, including training sessions
						on regulations and the policies and procedures of JCDC,
						was developed for the members of the EC. They were also
						provided with a well-defined job description, so that they
						could discharge their responsibilities in the organisation
						efficiently.
					</li>
					<li>
						An administrative team was given the responsibility
						of looking after the operational functioning and
						documentation requirements of the EC.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Domain III: Researcher and research staff</h5>
				<p>
					JCDC made sure that all the researchers and research staff
					were qualified in terms of education, training and experience.
					Systematic and detailed procedures and processes were
					introduced for the selection of researchers and research staff.
					The job descriptions were revised so that appropriate roles and
					responsibilities could be given to appropriate personnel. The
					roles and responsibilities of each member of the organisation
					were laid out more clearly. SOPs were developed on training
					and education and a training plan was brought out to
					outline and schedule the initial as well as continuing training
					programmes for the site personnel. The researchers and staff
					of the organisation were given adequate and appropriate
					training on a regular basis, keeping in view their roles within
					the organisation. Procedures and processes related to the
					management of clinical trials were developed so as to aid the
					research staff in carrying out their everyday activities more
					efficiently.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Completing one year of excellence</h4>
				<p>
					With its "full accreditation" status and being one of only three
					sites in India to be accredited by the AAHRPP, JCDC has gained
					global recognition. Moreover, preparing for the accreditation
					process provided JCDC with a much-needed opportunity
					to reflect upon and improve its existing SOPs in line with the
					global standards of ethical and good-quality clinical research.
				</p>
				<h5>Organisation</h5>
				<p>
					The feedback collected from the customers (sponsors,
					contract research organisations) and patients helped in
					measuring the satisfaction index, which may aid in improving
					customer&ndash;patient&ndash;institution relations. Any complaints are
					addressed through root-cause analysis and corrective action
					and preventive action (CAPA) is implemented. Following the
					accreditation, there was an increase in the confidence shown
					by the sponsors of clinical trials, viz pharmaceutical companies
					and CROs. The contracts and other funding agreements for
					sponsored research studies are evaluated for their financial
				</p>
				<p>
					clauses, provisions pertaining to arrangements for medical
					care and research-related injury, as well as to monitoring of
					research studies, terms regarding confidentiality, etc. prior
					to the submission of the initial protocol to the EC. The aim
					is to ensure ethical conduct of research for the protection
					of the participants. As a part of its ongoing programme for
					the quality improvement, the organisation carried out a
					Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to assess the key
					procedures followed in the conduct of clinical research.
					The FMEA touched upon the areas of i. informed consent, ii.
					investigational product management, storage, dispensing
					and accountability, iii. safety management, iv. site personnel
					training, v. source documentation and essential documents, vi.
					patient identification and screening process.
				</p>
				<p>
					This exercise helped JCDC to identify failure modes which
					could be avoided with the use of better control measures. In
					the process, the organisation became a worldwide pilot site for
					conducting quality improvement activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					JCDC is implementing an improved QA programme. This
					includes root-cause analysis of all deviations, which aids in the
					identification of areas that need improvement. Regular internal
					audits are conducted at a periodicity which ensures that weak
					areas are identified in the preliminary stage itself. The scope
					of the audits includes compliance with the protocol, local
					regulations, SOPs and EC documentation. Periodic evaluations
					are carried out to ensure that the members of the research
					staff are well versed with their job responsibilities, as well as
					the applicable regulatory requirements. The QA programme
					also audits the EC documentation, and reviews the EC minutes
					as well as the facilities available at the site.
				</p>
				<h5>Institutional review board or ethics committee</h5>
				<p>
					The functioning of the EC has improved considerably following
					the accreditation process. The accreditation process has
					played a pivotal role in promoting a holistic review process,
					which has made it easier to form a considered opinion on any
					new protocol, as well as to demonstrate JCDC's compliance
					with the local regulations and written SOPs. In its everyday
					functioning, the EC employs various tools, such as the initial
					application form and the form for the disclosure of conflict of
					interest. A detailed and updated account of the EC's minutes is
					maintained and the documentation practices have improved
					considerably, as is evident from the QA audit reports. The
					accreditation has greatly helped in increasing the efficiency
					of the EC. It has resulted in a reduction of almost 43% in
					its timelines (33 days in April 2012 to 19 days in December
					2012) for the review of a protocol. The timeline, which is
					reckoned from the day of the submission of the protocol to
					its final approval, is one of the quality indicators employed at
					the organisation. In the past one year, since JCDC received
					AAHRPP accreditation, 52 protocols have been submitted for
					initial review, with 51 studies obtaining approval and 1 being
					deferred for reasons related to its scientific validity. There has
					also been a marked improvement in the quality of the data
					collected for monitoring the quality indicators employed at the organisation. Any reported deviations from the protocol are
					assessed by the EC to determine whether they are of a serious
					and continuing nature, and also to determine the correctness
					of the CAPA implemented. More detailed information is now
					available to the members of the EC regarding the criteria to be
					followed while evaluating and reviewing research protocols
					at the time of the initial application and during subsequent
					reviews.
				</p>
				<h5>Researchers and research staff</h5>
				<p>
					The organisation now has a more detailed set of written policies
					and procedures for implementation, which have helped the
					research team. Through the process of accreditation, the
					research personnel at the site have become trained in and
					aware of the conduct of ethical research, HRPP and other
					applicable regulatory guidelines. The regular periodic training
					programmes have become more structured. There is also a
					greater focus on the improvement of the knowledge and
					expertise of the investigators, EC members and research staff,
					who are responsible for protecting the rights and welfare
					of research participants. Hence, it can be asserted that there
					has been a marked improvement in the quality of the clinical
					research conducted by the organisation, as well as in patient&ndash;
					customer relations. This includes the operation of the EC, and the
					professional development of the researchers and research staff.
				</p>
				<h5>Communication</h5>
				<p>
					In terms of communication, the EC and JCDC are now well
					connected due to the use of better communication practices.
					Prior to the accreditation, the QA team never interacted with
					the EC. Now, however, reports of all the audits conducted
					by the QA team are forwarded to the EC to make for greater
					transparency of procedures.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Accreditation evaluates the capability or performance of the
					organisation as an entity. It is not a one-time process, but
					requires continued efforts thereafter to improve upon the
					procedures relating to quality. Preparation for accreditation
					is not possible without self-assessment and this provides an
					organisation with an opportunity to determine its compliance
					with the standards, as well as to identify areas that require
					improvement <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sleem H, Abdelhai RA, Al-Abdallat I, Al-Naif M, Gabr HM, Kehil E, Sadiq BB, Y ousri R, Elsayed D, Sulaiman S, Silverman H.

				<p>
					In India, accreditation of clinical research sites and ECs is a
					voluntary process. Recent amendments in the regulations
					make it mandatory for ECs and individual trials to be registered
					with the DCGI and the CTRI, respectively. However, there is
					no local or governmental accreditation body in place for
					the authorisation of organisations to carry out research that keeps the protection of the research participants in mind.
					Organisations opt for accreditation as a means of improving
					quality. Accreditation can benefit them by helping them
					develop a strong HRPP that is at par with the local and global
					standards. It can also enhance their credibility in a larger range
					of research activities. Lack of accreditation has led to a wide
					inconsistency in the way individual ECs work in India. Hence,
					a governmental accreditation body and an accreditation
					programme that is well thought out and implemented can
					possibly establish confidence in India's research capabilities
					and capacity to ensure that participants in clinical research are
					given adequate protection.
