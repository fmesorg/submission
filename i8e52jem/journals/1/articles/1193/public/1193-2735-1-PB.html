  <p>6.6 Human rights: The physician shall not aid or  abet torture nor shall he be a party to either infliction of mental or physical  trauma or concealment of torture inflicted by some other person or agency in  clear violation of human rights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This is the manner in which the Indian Medical  Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 (passed  under Sections 20A and 33(m) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956), defines  'human rights'. No wonder, then, that the regulations fall terribly short of  reflecting a human rights sensibility in its provisions. One would have hoped  that the onslaught of HIV/AIDS in India in the last decade would have made the  medical fraternity acutely aware of the need to address and uphold human rights  while dealing with patients generally and people living with HIV/AIDS in  particular. HIV/AIDS had just such an impact in the United States where the  importance of consent before testing, confidentiality and non-discrimination  were seen as essential components in effectively dealing with the epidemic. This  had reverberations on the medical system in general, which saw great improvement  in patients' rights and much greater accountability from physicians. The Medical  Council of India (MCI) is clearly averse to this approach. This article attempts  to highlight some of the failings of the new regulations and explain the golden  opportunity that was lost due to an evidently insensitive and aimless approach  adopted by the MCI.</p>

  <h4>The absence of consent</h4>
  <p>The concept of consent is so fundamental to our lives  that it has been recognised under a variety of laws and ethical codes of  practice. The decision to give consent is a choice we often make in our daily  lives. The concept of consent derives from the seminal notion that every adult  human being of sound mind has the right to decide what should be done to her/his  body. This notion of autonomy is inherent to humans, and a violation of this  autonomy is considered a serious wrong - in criminal law (where such a violation  is described as assault and battery), in our Constitution which guarantees the  right to life and<em> liberty</em>, and in common law regimes through judgements  down the ages.</p>
  <p>One would imagine that consent would be a core  principle in the medical profession, where, due to the skill and knowledge  possessed by a physician and the trust bestowed in her/him, a relationship of  inequality develops that requires balance before a patient's body can be  interfered with. It would therefore be required that patients be given  information about procedures they need to undergo, so that they can make an  informed choice about such treatment.</p>
  <p>Shockingly, the new regulations virtually ignore this  fundamental principle. Not only is the concept of consent absent from the  underlying tone of the regulations, it is only referred to in one clause <em>('7.16: Before performing an operation the physician should obtain in  writing the consent...').</em> This clause is worded in such a manner that in  essence it compromises on the principle of individual autonomy. Although it does  mention that consent can be obtained from the patient himself, in the first  instance it permits consent taken from the <em>'husband or wife'</em>. This  provision is possibly aimed at regulating proxy consent but then the language  leaves much to be desired. The poor wording of this crucial clause reflects the  lacklustre approach and non-application of mind of the drafters who obviously  did not visualise the importance of consent. Instead the impression is given  that consent can be obtained from the spouse without the necessity to obtain the  same from the patient him/herself. An appropriate clause would have laid down  the unequivocal requirement of consent in any medical procedure and then  provided exceptions in various circumstances, such as in the case of unconscious  patients or minors.</p>
  <p>What of cases that do not deal with operative  procedures? Is consent not required in such circumstances? This question is  important considering that hospitals in India routinely conduct a variety of  tests (including HIV tests) on patients at the time of admission irrespective of  the treatment required.</p>
  <p>It is even more disappointing to find the absence of  the principle of consent anywhere else in the regulations. The regulations  provide that pathology tests or any other diagnostic laboratory investigations  require to '<em>...be done judiciously and not in a routine manner.'</em> This  language is not protective enough that it imposes a duty on the health care  worker to obtain consent. In the HIV/AIDS context particularly, where testing  for sero-status is a key issue, this provision gives much leeway to the  physician to insist on an HIV test without obtaining consent.</p>
  <p>In another clause of the regulations, decisions to  change treatment only require to be <em>'discussed/ explained'</em> to the  patient. The consent of the patient finds no mention here either.</p>
  <p>In the HIV/AIDS context, consent has been recognised  as essential before testing in the National AIDS Prevention and Control Policy  (NAPCP). Yet, it has been ignored in the IMC regulations.</p>

  <h4>Compromising  confidentiality</h4>
  <p>Like consent, the principle of confidentiality is  sacrosanct in legal and human rights discourse. It should be sacrosanct in any  sensible public health strategy too. Again, it is HIV/AIDS that has highlighted  the importance of maintaining confidentiality in order for stigma and  discrimination to be tackled, and for the effective control of the epidemic. Not  only have privacy and confidentiality been recognised as key human rights, but  their maintenance is a key component of an effective public health system. After  all, would anyone access the services of a physician if it was known that the  information shared in the visit would be divulged outside the doctor-patient  relationship? If people stopped accessing physicians how would society be able  to grapple with health crises that had disappeared underground? It has,  therefore, been established that confidentiality is crucial in any effective  public health system. However, the IMC Regulations, 2002, fall short of  protecting confidentiality in a precise and satisfactory manner.</p>
  <p>In dealing with issues such as the maintenance of  medical records, surely the patient should be guaranteed confidentiality.  However, the regulations fail in providing this. On the contrary, without any  controls being prescribed to maintain patient confidentiality, the regulations  provide that medical records shall be issued if any request for them is made  '<em>...by the patients/ authorised attendant or legal authorities involved...'.</em> This means that those other than the patient concerned could have access to  information that should be private between doctor and patient, without any  clarity on the grounds under which such information can be shared.</p>
  <p>The regulations even provide that a physician should  '...<em>ensure himself that the patient, his relatives or his responsible friends  have such knowledge of the patient's condition as will serve the best interests  of the patient and the family.'</em> This predicates that a physician actually  has a right to breach confidentiality to a wide spectrum of people and clearly  without consulting the party most concerned and whose right is at stake -  namely, the patient. Surely this goes against all norms of medical practice as  reflected in law and ethics.</p>
  <p>The regulations then provide specific grounds under  which a physician can disclose <em>'the secrets of a patient that have been  learnt in the exercise of his/her profession...'.</em> These include disclosure  under orders of a court of law, in cases of a notifiable disease and <em>'in  circumstances where there is a serious and identified risk to a specific person  and/or community'.</em> This appears to be an attempt by the MCI to factor in  the ratio of a leading judgement on medical confidentiality - Tarasoff v Regents  of the University of California (17 Cal 3d 425) which was cited in the Indian  Supreme Court's judgment in Mr. X v Hospital Z (1998) 8 SCC 296 (wherein the  Supreme Court of India suspended the right of HIV-positive people to marry).  Unfortunately the IMC appears to have got the framework laid down by the  American court a little wrong. The court in the case of Tarasoff sought to  delicately balance the need to maintain confidentiality against the need for  disclosure in very specific circumstances. Essentially it said that if a  physician found that an <em>identifiable third party was foreseeably endangered</em> due to the conduct of the patient then the physician had a duty to warn the  third party. Clearly then, disclosure has to be to a specific third party and  cannot be made generally. The regulations, however, conveniently permit the  physician to violate confidentiality in cases of risk to a community, thereby  permitting public disclosure. It is hard to imagine the citizenry accessing the  services of a health care professional who follows the framework set out in the  regulations.</p>
  <p>(It is important here to note that in the case of <em>Mr. X v Hospital Z</em> the Supreme Court of India did not require a  physician to divulge the HIV-positive status of a patient to his/her spouse. It,  however, held that if a physician made such a disclosure, s/he would not be  liable.)</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>The regulations also fail to put sufficient onus on  the private health sector to treat all patients. In the absence of  anti-discrimination laws to protect patients in the private sector (against  which the constitutional remedy of equality cannot be used), private  practitioners are left free to discriminate, as they rampantly do against  HIV-positive people in India. Following another Supreme Court judgment <em>[Parmanand Kataria v Union of India (1989) 4 SCC 286],</em> the regulations  provide that even private health care must treat a patient in emergency cases.  But this cannot improve the situation sufficiently. In order for the health care  system in India to reclaim its position as a key service provider, members of  the health care system must understand the importance of patients' human rights  and assist in their realisation. If this understanding of human rights remains  only 'the right against torture', and does not consider issues such as consent  and confidentiality within its framework, then the health care system will have  failed in its fundamental duty to improve the health of the community it serves.</p>
