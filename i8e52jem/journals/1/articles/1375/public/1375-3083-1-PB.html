				<h4>When a patient has previously expressed the desire never to go on a ventilator</h4>

				<p>
					Mrs SBG, a sprightly  eighty year old, lived alone in south Bombay. She became short of breath over a  two week period. She had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which was  related with inhalers. Her blood gases showed severe hypoxia as well as  hypercapnia. Though her sensorium was mildly lethargic, she had appropriate  judgement. She had bilateral crackles in the lungs and pitting edema up to the  knees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two years prior to this illness she had developed respiratory insufficiency  requiring a ventilator while recovering from surgery for subacute bowel  obstruction. That whole episode had been so traumatic to her that she had  repeatedly declared never to go on a ventilator again. Her daughter and son in-  law, both doctors, were well aware of her wishes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cause of the current worsening of her respiratory condition was presumed to  be a combination of right sided heart failure and possible lung infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					What should her relatives do at this point? What would the readers do? Should  they honor her previously expressed wishes and let her deteriorate slowly at  home providing only comfort and support? Should they ask her again about her  wishes regarding the ventilator in case she had changed her mind in face of  obvious respiratory distress? Should they overrule her previous wishes and take  her to the hospital assuming that this current problem was an acute condition  which would resolve with vigorous treatment and return her to her previous  feisty self?

				<h4>When the options are expensive and may be futile</h4>
				<p>
					Our gardener wanted to discuss his wife's illness. She was recently  diagnosed to have germ cell cancer of the ovary at the local public hospital.  Chemotherapy was advised, the cost of which would run into several thousand  rupees. He wanted to know what he should do.
				</p>
				<p>
					He had two small children. He worked in a factory and had taken on additional  employment as gardener for several people like us and made the rounds of his  customers on a motorcycle he had recently purchased so that he could reach more  customers in the time available in the evenings. He told us that he did not  much in the way of savings but thought that he could raise some funds by  selling off his motorcycle. He had discussed his financial situation with the  social worker in the public hospital who told him that he would be eligible for  some financial relief but would still be responsible for the major portion of  the cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should we give him all the information that we could find out about this  disease? Should we let him then make up his own mind? Should we explain that  the prognosis for this disease is pretty poor? What if he misunderstood our  description of statistical odds and decided on no treatment at all? Or what if  he bankrupted his and his children's future chasing the possibility of a cure?
				</p>
				<p>
				How does one convey the uncertainty in medical treatment and outcome? Or should  we discuss the options ourselves and tell him to follow a course of action that  is right in our opinion?</p>
				<p>What would the readers do? </p>

				<h4>The dilemma of the health care worker</h4>
				<p>
					What should health care workers do when they are asked to participate in a procedure that they oppose morally? Is there room for 'cooperation with  disagreement'?
				</p>
				<p>
					Taking the example of abortion, to what extent does the individual health  worker have a right to object to participate in an abortion? At what point?  What is the appropriate response of a gynaecologist who opposes abortion but is  asked to perform one? What if the woman has a tubal pregnancy and emergency  surgery is necessary to save the mother's life? Can the anaesthetist also  refuse to participate? The operating room nurse? Is it acceptable for the  orderly to refuse to wheel the patient into the operating theatre? And the  medical student on rotation who is asked to take a medical history before the  abortion? The clerk who must admit the patient? What if this is the only health  service in the vicinity?
