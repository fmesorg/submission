				<h4>Tuberculosis in chronic conflict areas</h4>
				<p>
					As an M.Sc. student in public health for developing countries at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I am currently working on a dissertation which examines the management of tuberculosis in countries experiencing prolonged armed conflicts. The choice of topic is based on personal experience in a humanitarian organisation in several war-afflicted areas. My research question is:
				</p>
				<p>
					What are the appropriate measures for controlling tuberculosis in countries experiencing prolonged armed conflicts?
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to the long treatment schedule for tuberculosis, the question of when to start a control programme in such settings is always a matter of long discussion. Clinicians face ethical dilemmas not offering anti-TB treatment for presumed cases of tuberculosis. On the other hand, public health managers are concerned about the development and spread of drug resistance and about the quality and sustainability of the tuberculosis control programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would like to ask readers if they have any experience on this particular topic. Any reference to literature or personal experience is welcome. I have a comprehensive questionnaire which I would like to send anyone who was faced with this problem, and who was involved in the decision to start or postpone the start of a tuberculosis programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for your interest and cooperation,
				</p>
