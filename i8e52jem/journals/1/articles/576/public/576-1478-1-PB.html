				<h4>Kendler S, Kodner IJ, Keune JD. The role of the poor in medical research and the physician's duty to protect. Surgery. 2013 Feb;153(2):287-91a</h4>
				<p>
					The  divide between medical innovation and routine clinical practice is a grey zone.  Clinicians are often torn between their dual roles as healers and  investigators, between the need to cure and the desire to improve existing  practice. While medical research involves "experimentation" on human subjects  to identify novel treatments, one is often tempted to use newer techniques to  improve the outcomes of treatment in routine clinical practice. There is no  controversy surrounding the adoption of a new therapy which has been proven to  be superior to the existing methods of treatment and which can be delivered as  well, if not better. However, a moral and ethical dilemma arises when the new  therapy has not yet been proven to be superior and the treating physician is  not certain that administering this  treatment would be at least as good as providing standard care. This is  especially so when dealing with potentially vulnerable patients. In  procedure-related fields, such as surgery, endoscopy and interventional  radiology or cardiology, this problem is compounded because the physician not  only has to decide if the "new" treatment is truly experimental or just an  adaptation of an established method, but also whether he/she possesses the  skills and expertise required for the new procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					This paper  uses a hypothetical clinical scenario to examine two very important ethical  aspects of clinical practice, ie, the application of the principles of research  ethics to routine clinical care and the challenges of using vulnerable  populations as subjects for the training of clinicians. The case described is  that of a semi-literate, uninsured patient who needs to undergo a standard  surgical procedure (cholecystectomy). The surgeon wants to use this opportunity  to improve his proficiency in an innovative technique - robotic surgery - which  he wishes to master to perform robotic liver transplants subsequently. The  complexity of the problem is enhanced because the subject is semi-literate and  is therefore, not considered capable of giving truly "informed" consent for a  procedure that is not standard-of care. Also, since she will be getting the  surgery done for free, she may feel inhibited about refusing to undergo the  robotic cholecystectomy. The paper discusses the ways in which this situation  can be handled and the ethical issues raised by each of the alternatives  mentioned.
				</p>
				<p>
					One option  is to perform the experimental (robotic) technique and consider it justified  for the following reasons. First, the patient is receiving free treatment from  society and, therefore, should contribute to the progress of medical science.  Second, using this patient for enhancing the surgeon's skills will be  advantageous for many future patients. While this seems acceptable in the  larger perspective of scientific advancement, it is a gross violation of the  patient's personal right to autonomy, the physician's obligation to primarily  provide benefit, and a breach of the principle of social justice. The second  option is to offer the patient both treatment choices and attempt to obtain  informed consent for robotic surgery. This involves several issues, such as the  difficulty of explaining the technicalities of an experimental procedure to a  semi-educated patient and the question of whether the consent would be truly  "informed," which again defeats the principle of autonomy. The last alternative  involves creating an independent committee to standardise and supervise the use  of experimental procedures in vulnerable populations on a case-by-case basis to  ensure that patients' rights are protected, while at the same time allowing  medical science to progress. A practical difficulty could be the feasibility of  getting prompt responses to such situations on a day to day basis to ensure  that treatment is not delayed. However, this might be an ideal long-term  solution, though it would need careful planning and investment of resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					After careful  consideration of the pros and cons of these options, the authors conclude that  the ideal and safest option is to perform the surgery using the default  technique (laparoscopy). In this way, the patient receives "standard" care,  there is no experimentation and the dilemma of obtaining consent from a  vulnerable patient for an experimental procedure is avoided. Though there is no  long-term benefit to society, the patient's autonomy is protected and the  principles of beneficence and justice are upheld.
				</p>
				<p>
					We feel  that the solution offered by the authors is conveniently safe, but overly  simplistic. In this context, two issues must be considered. First, is a  semi-literate patient incapable of understanding the difference between  standard-of-care and experimental therapy, even if she cannot understand the  actual technicalities of the procedure? Surely, a person who can give  "informed" consent for a surgery as complex as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy  should be able to decide if she wants to undergo a novel procedure. Is it not  being paternalistic and violating the patient's autonomy, to assume that she  will not be able to comprehend the nuances of robotic surgery and, on this  basis, deprive her of the opportunity to contribute to medical progress? The  authors have briefly alluded to this, but have concluded that non-maleficence  should parallel patient autonomy. The second issue relates to the training of  doctors. Academic hospitals train people to become competent doctors and this  is a necessary process to ensure that future generations get the same, if not  better standards of medical care than we have today. This will not be possible  if less-experienced doctors are not allowed to treat and carry out established  procedures on patients, albeit with supervision, and also (as in this  hypothetical scenario) unless  experienced doctors are allowed to offer novel treatment and perform new  procedures after obtaining informed consent. Every new technique has a learning  curve and if doctors do not constantly practise and upgrade their skills, they  will never achieve proficiency in the latest procedures. It would be na&iuml;ve and  unrealistic to expect that all physicians should perform new procedures only  after they have been mentored by an expert till this learning curve is completed.
				</p>
				<p>
					To sum  it up, though in this particular case, performing a laparoscopic surgery on the  patient would be more expedient, the other option, ie, explaining both  procedures to the patient and allowing her the freedom to choose, would be  communally advantageous and ethically appropriate, even if more complex. If  during the counselling process, the surgeon genuinely feels that the patient  does not understand what the new procedure is all about, he can resort to the  default option of performing a standard surgery. If such situations are  frequent, an experimental treatment research protocol could be developed to  supervise such procedures - but this process should be applied to all patients  potentially suitable for such procedures, irrespective of their level of  education or paying capacity. The assumption that semi-educated or uneducated  patients are incapable of understanding or that the poor have no altruism is  both paternalistic and presumptuous. Socioeconomically backward patients depend  on society to meet their healthcare needs and they should not be exploited and  made guinea pigs for experimentation by virtue of this dependence; at the same  time, they have the right to contribute to the progress of medical science and  they should not be denied the opportunity to make this choice.
