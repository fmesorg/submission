				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					AIDS no longer is an  affliction of any particular group. Estimates reveal that women are being  increasingly affected, and the infection rate among women is equal to that  among men.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the World Health Organisation estimates a cumulative  total of 30-40 million HIV infectious in men, women and children by the year  2000, of which 90% shall be in the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					On an overview, the issue of HIV infection in women needs the following  considerations.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The current scenario and areas where we need women
					</li>
					<li>
						Specialised       areas of concern
					</li>
					<li>
						HIV       prevention strategies tend to focus on women and children
					</li>
					<li>
						Certain       questions of ethics that require clarifications.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>The current scenario</h4>
				<p>
					Looking hitherto at the  known possibilities of HIV transmission, one gets an idea of the importance of  the issue of 'Women and HIV'.
				</p>
				<p>
					HIV transmission can be caused by way of (i) horizontal  transmission (through sexual contact, blood transfusion or sharing or syringes  among drug-addicts.) and (ii) vertical transmission, i. e., from mother to  child (perinatal transmission).
				</p>
				<p>
					The two areas principally involving women are heterosexual  transmission and perinatal routes of transmission.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Women and heterosexual transmission</h4>
				<p>
					Heterosexual  transmission (i. e. man to woman and vice versa) is on the increase throughout  the world. This implies in turn, that the involvement of women is on the  increase. Transmission here is bi-directional, meaning it can be from man to  woman and/or from woman to man. Any one who is sexually active can acquire or  transmit HIV through sexual contact. A normal sexual relationship with someone  who has been infected with HIV is sufficient to acquire the infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a time in the history of AIDS, when homosexuality  amongst men was implicated an important cause in the spread of HIV infection.  However, today, since heterosexual intercourse is becoming the predominant mode  of HIV transmission in most parts of the world, infections among women of  child-bearing age are rising steeply.
				</p>
				<p>
					The involvement of women is not exclusive. When more men are  infected, more women are at high risk of being infected, since these men pass  it on to their wives and female sex partners. This element of risk is especially  high when the men are asymptomatic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Increased incidence amongst prostitutes (female sex workers) acts  in two ways. On one hand, their involvement adds to the direct increase of an  affected female population; and on the other, they are the source for a  secondary chain of transmission to yet another group of women (mostly innocent  and 'caught unaware' wives and other female partners) through their male  clientele.
				</p>
				<p>
					The subordinate status of women in the family and in society  almost throughout the world makes them more vulnerable to infection. Women,  especially, wives, are frequently in the dark about the sexual practices of  their male sex partners and find it difficult to insist on safer sex practices  like use of condoms. In a country like India, where the woman's opinion is  often ignored, neither her knowledge nor her awareness can offer her  protection. Not many wives can demand safe sex practices from their husbands.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some important facts about heterosexual transmission:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Multiple       sex partner relations increase risk of infection.
					</li>
					<li>
						Repeated       relations with prostitutes increase woman-to-man transmission of infection
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The above mentioned facts should remind us that the role of women  in HIV transmission cannot be under-estimated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual relations,  AIDS selectively hits young and middle aged women, with consequent disruption  of families and orphaned children. The work force is also depleted.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Women and perinatal transmission</h4>
				<p>
					In perinatal  transmission the mother passes on her infection to her children. The  transmission can be when the foetus is developing in the mother's womb, during  delivery and/or while breast feeding.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the number of children infected with HIV is not reported  routinely, World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that world-wide, HIV  infected women have borne close to 1 million infected children and about 2  million non-infected children. The latter have already been orphaned due to the  death of one or both the parents or will soon be becoming so.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Special area of concern</h4>
				<p>
					One of the most  important risk situations of HIV transmission is the 'sex-work situation'.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Sex-work situation' popularly called prostitution, is a  potential risk setting for HIV transmission and the transmission could be:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						from       female sex worker to clients;
					</li>
					<li>
						from       clients to the female sex worker;
					</li>
					<li>
						from       either of them to their other sex partners.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The extent of this transmission varies according to the cultural,  social, economic and ethico-social contexts of the situation and society.
				</p>
				<p>
					Certain factors serve as determinants of the rate of sex-work  related transmission of HIV:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						prevalence       of HIV infection among client and/or sex workers; frequency of       unprotected sex;
					</li>
					<li>
						use       and acceptability of condoms;
					</li>
					<li>
						prevalence       of other behaviours, such as the sharing of un-sterilised drug, injection       equipment;
					</li>
					<li>
						economic       status of both sex workers and clients; and
					</li>
					<li>
						working       conditions including the legal constraints under which prostitutes       operate.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In a sex-work-related transmission, a client-focus component  needs to be remembered. Whatever prevention or safety measure is proposed in  such a situation, members of clientele tend to offer resistance to the measure.  They are not usually prepared to undergo the prevention method. Most sex  workers repeatedly report client refusal to use condoms. These sex workers, who  depend on their clientele for survival, are not in a position to demand condom  use for safer sex from their clients, for fear of being left unsupported.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another constraint in this regard is lack of support from the  management of the sex-work establishment. Those involved in the provision of  commercial sex (owner and managers of bars, brothels, red light houses, taxi- drivers, pimps) often discourage any such practice, again for fear of losing  business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus the female sex-worker is exposed to a high risk situation of  being both a target of HIV transmission and a source. Society does nothing to  safeguard her and help her prevent spread of the disease.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Preventive strategies</h4>
				<p>
					Let us glance at the  strategies that are being currently employed to nullify at least some of the  problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several AIDS prevention and control programmes currently in vogue  tend to place greater emphasis on issues concerning 'Women and AIDS'. The  programmes necessarily need to focus on:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A       prevention of HIV transmission from and to women;
					</li>
					<li>
						lessening       the impact of the AIDS pandemic on women by making them educators,       counsellors and family caregivers; and
					</li>
					<li>
						ensuring       whole-hearted participation of women in AIDS control programmes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					A gender-specific approach aimed at benefiting women is being  incorporated into almost all AIDS strategies now.
				</p>
				<p>
					The World Health Organisation and other international agencies are  developing specific action plans on women and AIDS. They acknowledge the subordinate  status of women in society and recognise their susceptibility to infection and  transmission. They attempt to tailor prevention programmes to the particular  needs of women in order to interrupt transmission. An important aspect of these  plans is the support and testing of preventive methods directly controllable  and usable by women. One such product, the 'female condom' (or fendom) hit the  European market in 1992. Efficacy of vaginally applied virucides (drugs that  kill or destroy the virus) is also being tested.
				</p>
				<p>
					Studies that targeted sex-workers showed several obstacles to the  success of any preventive or control project in sex work areas. These include  client refusal of condoms, non-use of condoms in other sex relationships of the  male clients, lack of supply and availability of condoms, lack of awareness,  non-acceptance or suppression by clients of already present HIV infection  (even if they know of it) and higher incidence of other sexually transmitted  diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though awareness and requisite knowledge can be provided through  health education, the rest of the obstacles need specialised solutions. These,  if left unsolved, would endanger the female population further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Client co-operation is essential in any of these projects.  Particularly dangerous is the client who does not reveal his ailment,  especially if he has an STD, as according to him the female sex worker after  all gets her 'fee' for her services and does not enjoy the right of questioning  or knowing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The global programme of the WHO and other integrated AIDS  strategies target female sex-workers but they also incorporate parallel  programmes for the clientele, managers, and others involved (the police, health  and social welfare agencies that monitor commercial sex-work).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Problems that need emphasis</h4>
				<p>
					It cannot be over- stressed that most of the strategies which claim to benefit women are yet to  gain momentum. Developing countries, including India, have not overcome the  difficulties that arise on social, psycho-social and moral grounds, to ensure  that women, as the subordinate class, will not have to undergo 'stigmatised'  suffering.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is mandatory of any AIDS prevention or control strategy to  relate to the definitive and specific problems of women and ensure break of  transmission.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from empowering women with information on the prevention of  disease, they should also be given adequate training to act as peers and  educators to the risk groups. Women counsellors, attending on target  populations school and college students, pre-marital youth, housewives,  working and non-working women, women of low socio-economic status and media- watchers, should be encouraged and provided sufficient back-up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women should also be imparted necessary and adequate knowledge to  render their roles as wholesome care-givers in the family and society. A  situation with an HIV-infected AIDS-afflicted patient requires sensitive and  sensible handling - for which a woman could best fitted with requisite  awareness and training.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Questions that need answers</h4>
				<p>
					Certain 'sayings' have  repeatedly been affirmed on women's role in halting the AIDS pandemic.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						female       sex-workers make up a chief source of HIV infection;
					</li>
					<li>
						the       chain of transmission primarily begins with them;
					</li>
					<li>
						unethical       and unhygienic practices amongst them leads to greater affliction of their       male clientele.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					How far these are true, is uncertain.
				</p>
				<p>
					A woman, who has been declared HIV-infected or AIDS-afflicted, is  looked upon with contempt. She is regarded as a personification of immorality  and disloyalty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, the question that remains unanswered is: who was  responsible primarily, for bringing HIV infection into the female population?
				</p>
				<p>
					If a female sex-worker is implicated, which of her male clients  gave it to her? When a wife gets infected, how much of her husband's sexual  practice, was/is she able to control?
				</p>
				<p>
					The chain of transmission towards and from a female sex worker  could only be through her clients. Is she given a right, in the first place, to  know of her client's relationship with other partners (some of whom might be  infected and the start of the chain) and ask for protection against any  sexually transmitted disease, leave alone AIDS? Will her clientele approve of  safety measures implemented by her and still continue to patronise her?
				</p>
				<p>
					What about the innocent, flawless, loyal and sincere wife? Though  sincere and loyal to her marriage and husband, she remains a subordinate to her  husband. She has no access to information on him. She cannot control his sexual  and other practices. On the other hand, she will almost certainly be ostracised  if found suffering from AIDS or HIV infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					These aspects require urgent action.
				</p>
				<p>
					To ensure complete success, strategies to counter AIDS should  necessarily raise these questions and provide answers.
