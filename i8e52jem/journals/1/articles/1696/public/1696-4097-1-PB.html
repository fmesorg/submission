				<p>
					The  title of this book by Professor James Calnan, Emeritus Professor of Plastic  Surgery at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith is, in itself,  thought-provoking. Talking with - and not to - patients is what we should  really be doing, listening to what they say (or wish to say but are too scared  to voice). The lessons taught by Professor Calnan will help us respect the  rights of patients. They will also help avoid much unpleasantness and ill-will.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless  there is a passionate conviction in the importance of talking with that  pnrticular patient, we cannot really aspire to the practice of good medicine.  'Eventually you must develop a conscience which says every time: "Have I  said enough or too much, could I have spoken more kindly, listened more  carefully?" ' He argues strongly for transcending 'the mediocrity that  passes for communication today'.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Bedside manner</h4>
				<p>
					Much of what is termed excellent bedside manner consists of the way in which we  put the patient at ease and facilitate a meaningful dialogue in which none of  the patient's questions remains unanswered. The first requirement for this is  an attitude of concern.'You can't fake attitudes'. Subterfuge generates  uneasiness, distrust and distaste. A sincere smile, a gentle touch and the  question 'What can I do for you?' helps break the ice when you first face a  patient. Such an attitude can only be based on respect for the patient as a  person.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tact,  persuasion and participation will elicit the kind of cooperation never to be  invoked by browbeating and the imposition of authority.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>How can we improve matters?</h4>
				<p>
					The first step lies in  recognising the fact that improvement is necessary. Patients find doctors  impatient, always in a rush, unwilling to explain and, at times, abrupt to the  point of rudeness.'The patient is hungry for conversation and companionship,  comfort and reassurance; he is lonely and his pride is hurt by illness; his  mind and body are equally afflicted yet no one seems to care.. .'
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The good talker</h4>
				<p>
					Is sensitive to his  listener. Strives to make the other respond. Looks interested. Always allows  the other to speak when he wishes. Follows the lead indicated by the other. Is  entertaining, has humour. Uses language with feeling and sensitivitv. Discovers  topics which interest the other. Is a good listener. Knows when to stop.
				</p>
				<p>
					Courteous  conversation at a time convenient to the patient and yourself will go a long  way in reducing complaint. A warm, friendly attitude; sensitivity to his  worries and aches; clear, simple sentences; truthful answers with  acknowledgement of deficiencies in one's knowledge and expertise and leaving  behind room for optimism - even if be merely the expectation of comfort over  the remaining days - will reassure most patients.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Communication</h4>
				<p>
					We pass  messages to another to inform, instruct and persuade. In dealing with patients  we also hope to inspire confidence. Passing on too much information or only  that of the unwelcome kind may prove counterproductive. At times it is best to  parcel out information piece-meal with enough repetition to provide links,  concentrating all the time on information required by the patient at that time.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is up to us to ensure that the message has been received and understood. It is  best to provide details on the nature of illness, findings on investigation or  at surgery, instructions on further drug therapy and follow-up examinations in  writing. Convey facts and opinion separately.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The consultation</h4>
				<p>
					This is a serious  occasion, the doctor trying to elicit facts as a preliminary to physical  examination of the patient and arriving at a diagnosis, plan of action.  Remember that conversation is between unequal persons. The doctor is in good  health, free from pain and sickness. The patient is troubled by illness and its  consequent anxieties. The interview occurs at a time and place selected by the  doctor, who also decides its duration.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Spoken speech and gesture</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						This is direct,  effective and produces immediate response.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use feedback all the time. Listen to the patient.
					</li>
					<li>
						Speak slowly, clearly, in short sentences.
					</li>
					<li>
						Start with the familiar. Proceed slowly to the unfamiliar and difficult.
					</li>
					<li>
						Establish a logical chain of thought and avoid ambiguity.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pauses, gestures, change in rhythm of voice will stimulate interest.
					</li>
					<li>
						Humour, anecdotes, illustrations may make explanations more effective.
					</li>
					<li>
						Do your best to dispel fear.
					</li>
					<li>
						A smile, handshake or touch that comforts may do more than mere words.
					</li>
					<li>
						Leave behind written details, especially when instructions are offered.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Above all else, listen to the patient</h4>
				<p>
					'There are two great bars to communication: not taking enough time to talk to  the other and not listening to what is being said.. . Be alert for the  unexpected remark. Do not interrupt the patient's speech or appear anxious to  cut in.'
				</p>
				<p>
					At  the end of the consultation, the patient should be left in a more pleasant  frame of mind, having been provided information, assurance and advice.'Life is  difficult enough already and may so easily become unbearable without hope.. .  When it comes to giving the patient his diagnosis, tact and a kindly humanity  are paramount.'
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Talking about diagnosis and prognosis</h4>
				<p>
					Most of us start with a  presumptive diagnosis. After reaching a working diagnosis we plan a course of  action regarding tests, procedures or therapy. The definitive diagnosis - an  accurate label of the patient's illness - usually follows analysis of all the  evidence and, often, the effect of treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  most instances, the patient wishes to know what is wrong with him. More  important, he needs to learn whether his illness is serious; details on the  expenses he will need to incur; how long he will be away from work, home;  whether he will be left with handicaps or restrictions placed on his way of  life and how he can help in ensuring a rapid recovery.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discuss  the diagnosis as soon as you are able to make one. This helps dispel anxiety.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is best to provide truthful information in simple terms, remaining acutely  conscious of what the patient does not want to know. When the situation is gloomy.  Try and find patches of brightness - absence of pain, comfort and care provided  by a loving family. Calnan points out that often the patient is reluctant to  discuss grim news with the spouse for fear of causing pain. Use all the skill  and diplomacy you can muster to make them converse without fear.'The rewards  can be great all round.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Many  patients will respond with gratitude to questions such as 'Is there any other  information you need?' or 'Is there anything else I can do for you?'
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Talking about treatment</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Try and provide the  following information to the Patient's satisfaction.
					</li>
					<li>
						What is the treatment for his illness? If it involves surgical or other  procedures, describe the procedure, using drawings if needed. Discuss pros and  cons with some details on possible complications, morbidity, mortality.
					</li>
					<li>
						Names of drugs, their indications, how each of them is to be taken and for  how long.
					</li>
					<li>
						How important is it to take the drugs'? What if he happens to miss a dose or  two?
					</li>
					<li>
						What are the side effects of the drugs and how will he recognise them? Which  side effects should he specially look for? Which side effect should he bring to  the notice of the doctor at once? Will alcohol interfere with his drug therapy?
					</li>
					<li>
						Can he drive, swim, have sexual relations whilst on these drugs'?
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Where  possible categorise the drugs. Provide clear, simple, written instructions on  dosage and administration.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Consent</h4>
				<p>
					Voluntary  agreement to a course of action can never be valid till the patient has been  provided full and frank information on it. Whilst the patient cannot be  educated to understand his illness or the procedure as well as does his doctor,  he can be assisted to make a rational decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Describe  the problem as simply and accurately as possible, using evidence obtained by  examination and investigation. Analyse the situation, explaining the need for  further tests or other procedures and the line of treatment being advised.  Discuss alternatives, pointing out the pros and cons and prescribe the best  solution under the circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					Except  in an emergency, give the patient and his relatives enough time to arrive at a  decision. Do not coerce.
				</p>

				<h4>Ensure that the patient is aware that</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						He can refuse the  procedure or course of action.
					</li>
					<li>
						Seek another opinion.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make a choice on where he will undergo the procedure or treatment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Leave your clinic or hospital at will.
					</li>
					<li>
						Seek advice elsewhere without incurring your displeasure.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Talking with relatives</h4>
				<p>
					Introduce yourself to  the relatives, ascertain the name/s of the principal relative/s and address  them politely. The patient's diagnosis, prognosis and treatment must be  discussed in detail with them in private after ensuring the patient's tacit  approval. Relatives may, often, be able to tell you what the patient is afraid  of voicing or reluctant to narrate. They may also be able to offer sound advice  on dealing with social, personal or domestic problems faced by the patient.  Confidential information about the patient should not be passed on to the  relatives unless this is specifically requested by the patient. There is,  however, no need to be secretive about the patient's well-being or progress.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The fatal illness</h4>
				<p>
					The traditional role of  the doctor, from time immemorial, has been to cure sometimes, to relieve often,  to comfort always.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  time spent talking to dying patients must, of necessity, be longer but it is  time well spent. If you have gained the patient's trust he will expect that you  will not let him down towards the end.'When treatment has failed to cure  disease and the patient is going to die, the doctor and nurse feel they too  have faiIed. They do not recognise that the patient now requires another form  of treatment...'
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking  after a dying person involves care. In the weeks before death, the doctor can  ensure freedom from pain (physical, social and spiritual); as regular bodily  functions as possible; cleanliness and comfort; and the presence of his loved  ones. At the moment of death, privacy, familiar surroundings, demonstrations of  love by those near to him and, in many cases, spiritual warmth, are greatly  valued. When Mother Teresa is asked the greatest misfortune of the dying, she  replies: 'Loneliness'.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Complaints and criticism</h4>
				<p>
					The vast majority are  trivial and born of misunderstanding. Sympathetically dealt with they may melt  away.
				</p>
				<p>
					Calnan  found that most complaints stemmed from one or more of six causes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						being given insufficient information;
					</li>
					<li>
						not being told about specific procedures or operations to be performed;
					</li>
					<li>
						untreated pain;
					</li>
					<li>
						noise;
					</li>
					<li>
						rough handling, lack of immediate attention when needed , being made to wait  and being treated like a simpleton;
					</li>
					<li>
						not being told what is to happen next, and expect duration of saty in  hospital...
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Knowing  that the patients' minds are idle when in hospital; vulnerable to anxiety,  boredom and loneliness it is surprising that we are not subject to a barrage of  complaints.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  ill individual will be snappy, show bad temper and overlook all that is being  done for him. It is up to us to pay heed to aphorism four below, get to the  root of the complaint quickly and deal with it to the patient's satisfaction.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Complaints: some aphorisms</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						To grumble is human.
					</li>
					<li>
						Serious complaints can come from nice people.
					</li>
					<li>
						All arguments have three sides: your, mine and the facts.
					</li>
					<li>
						All complaints have some foundation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Grievances grow when neglected.
					</li>
					<li>
						Grievances grow in size and importance irrespective of the data.
					</li>
					<li>
						A grouse becomes an official complaint in time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Grievances are prolonged in proportion to the number of people involved.
					</li>
					<li>
						The majority of complaints are trivial but it is at times difficult to  differentiate the trivial from the serious.
					</li>
					<li>
						Prevention is better than facing plaintiffs in court.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Treat  all complaints seriously and respectfully, however trivial they may seem to  you. The are very important to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Try  to understand the patient's position, especially in hospital. He is bed-bound  in a strange environment, not feeling too good, wholly dependent on those who  serve him. his precious pills confiscated. He may be lonely, depressed and  frightened.'
				</p>
				<p>
					If  you are in the wrong, say so at once, do all you can to rectify the situation  and apologise for the error. Once you have investigated and dealt with the  complaint, show your appreciation to the patient for his having drawn your  attention to a deficiency in services.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">

						Getting bogged down in trivia.
					</li>
					<li>

					</li>
					<li>
						Blaming others.
					</li>
					<li>

					</li>
					<li>
						Doing nothing.
					</li>
					<li>
