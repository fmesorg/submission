					The  global HIV/AIDS crisis and issues related to access to drugs for its treatment,  on which Omar Schwartz's paper <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Swartz O. Access to AIDS medicine: ethical considerations. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;3:75-6." id="1">(1)</a> focuses, also raise key questions about the  notion of property and property rights. It would be useful in this context to  discuss how intellectual property rights (IPRs) have developed in modern times,  and the contradictions inherent in the system today.
				</p>
				<p>
					While  property rights have long been recognised, 'intellectual' property is a modern  notion that comprises information, ideas and knowledge. Unlike other property  rights, IPRs are essentially state-mandated monopolies. Discoverers and  inventors are thought to deserve special reward or privilege because of the  benefit of their discoveries or inventions to society. Public good is not  considered a reward in itself and certain incentives are needed to encourage  invention or innovation.
				</p>

				<h4>Contradiction  in the philosophy of IPRs</h4>
				<p>
					The philosophy behind IPRs is built on the contradiction that to promote the  development of ideas, one must reduce the freedom with which people can use  them. Liberal philosophy has reflected this contradiction during the genesis of  the concept of IPRs&mdash;a tension between an individual's claim to the product of  his labour and undeserved monopoly privilege granted by the State.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  industrial revolution and capitalist mode of production led to the necessity of  redefining 'property'. Tools acquired a new economic value and it became  possible to duplicate and distribute them in quantity. To encourage their  invention, copyright and patent laws were developed. The earliest patent laws  were an expression of the need to ensure that innovations did not die with the original  inventor; they were designed to promote disclosure and dissemination of  knowledge <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kamberi-Mbote P. Patents and development. In: Vyas Y et al. (eds). Law and development in the Third World. Nairobi: Faculty of Law, University of Nairobi, 1994:412-25." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are  entering an era in which major parts of the world economy are based on ideas  and knowledge&mdash;goods that take no material form. Unlike physical goods, there are  no physical obstacles in providing an abundance of ideas. IPRs are, thus, an  attempt to create an artificial scarcity to give rewards to a few at the  expense of many.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us  examine what is sought to be protected through IPRs. The central distinction between  intellectual property and physical property is that the former can be  transferred without it leaving the possession of the original owner.  Information is acquiring intrinsic value, not as a means to acquistion but as  the object to be acquired. Laws to protect property rights were developed to  protect, in the first instance, land. Later, when manufacturing became the  dominant mode of economic activity, laws grew around the centralised  institutions that needed protection for their reserves of capital labour, and  hardware. Today, to a large extent, information has replaced land, capital and  hardware as a commodity that needs to be protected in order to protect control  over the means of production.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alongside  this has developed a new contradiction&mdash;information or ideas are sought to  be commodified at the same time when technology has made it possible to  exchange ideas in a radically free environment. Exchange and control cannot  coexist&mdash;the more tightly we protect one, the less there will be of the other. If  ideas are to be exchanged in the marketplace, the basic assumption of a  marketplace with regard to physical objects, that value is based on scarcity,  should hold good. But this is contrary to the nature of information, which may,  in many cases, increase in value with dissemination.

				<h4>Monopoly  as a facilitator of creativity?</h4>
				<p>
					Central to the projected utility of IPRs is the notion that creation is  facilitated by providing a temporary monopoly which ensures that the author of  a work will be the sole beneficiary of any profits. The earliest patent and  copyright laws were geared, to an extent, to benefit the individual artisan, or  the author of a literary piece or a musical score. But with the  institutionalisation of the concept of IPRs, individual creators ceased to be  the beneficiaries, and were replaced by large corporate interests. In practice,  today, most creators do not actually gain much benefit from intellectual  property. Independent inventors are frequently ignored or exploited. When  employees of corporations and governments have an idea worth protecting, it is  usually copyrighted or patented by the organisation, not the employee. Since  intellectual property can be sold, it is usually large corporate entities that  benefit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  value of intellectual products is not due to the work of an individual, or any  small group. Intellectual products are social products. Even in the US and  Japan, an enormous part of research is funded by the State. The line,  therefore, is blurred between what constitutes 'basic research' by a company  and what it draws from public-funded research. In fact, half of the US$ 70  billion invested in drug research each year comes from the public sector,  chiefly as funding for basic research, which is the highest risk part of the  drug development pipeline. Ten AIDS drugs were fully developed or supported by  publicly funded research, and the US government supported the clinical research  for 34 of the 37 new cancer drugs marketed in the US since 1955 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bollier D.

				<h4>Knowledge  in the marketplace</h4>
				<p>
					Open  ideas can be examined, challenged, modified and improved. To turn scientific  knowledge into a commodity arguably inhibits the development of science.  Innumerable examples show that IPRs have been used to suppress innovation.  Companies may take out a patent, or buy someone else's patent to inhibit others  from applying the ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  pharmaceutical sector is a classic pointer to the dangers of a strong IPR  regime. The huge inequity in the IPR system today is exemplified by the fact  that while millions die due to HIV/AIDS and national economies are being  devastated, the prices of drugs to treat the disease can be 40 times or more  than what is warranted by the actual production and distribution costs. Large  pharmaceutical companies have generated super profits through the patenting of  top-selling drugs. But drugs which sell in the market may have little to do  with the actual health needs of the global population. Often, there is nobody  to pay for the drugs required to treat diseases in the poorest countries.  Research and patenting in pharmaceuticals are driven not so much by therapeutic  needs as by the need of companies to maintain their super profits. Today,  transnational corporations (TNCs) with global tentacles, wishing to retain the  huge growth rates of the 1970s and 1980s, are trying to pool resources for  research and development. As a consequence, we will see 10-12 large TNCs  survive as 'research-based' companies in the business of drug development and  patenting. The bulk of drug manufacturing will be done by smaller companies.  Today, in the US, this trend is already discernible. While the volume of sales  of large multinational corporations (MNCs) has stagnated in the past decade,  sales of small companies producing generic drugs show a double-digit growth.  Still, the profitability of large MNCs has actually increased. Clearly, these  companies can thrive on 'rent incomes' made possible by strong IPR protection  without enhancing their manufacturing activities <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Combating generics: pharmaceutical brand defense.

					Given  their monopoly over knowledge, these companies will decide which drugs to  develop&mdash;those that can be sold to people with the money to buy them. Thus, we  have the development of 'life-style' drugs such as Viagra, which target  illusory ailments of the rich. On the other hand, we have 'orphan' drugs that  can cure life-threatening diseases in Asia and Africa, but are not produced  because the poor cannot afford to pay for them. Today's medical research is  highly skewed in favour of heart diseases and cancer rather than diseases such  as malaria, cholera, dengue fever and AIDS, which kill many more, especially in  developing countries. Less than 10% of the US$ 56 billion spent each year  globally on medical research is aimed at the health problems affecting 90% of  the world's population <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research. Investing in health research and development. Geneva: WHO, September 1996." id="5">(5)</a>. On the other hand, some drugs developed in the  1950s and 1960s to treat tropical diseases have begun to disappear from the  market because they are seldom or never used in the developed world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clearly,  the imbalance between the rights and obligations of a patentee has become  grossly skewed in the course of the development and expansion of IPRs. It is  time to reflect how 'ideas' that are clearly 'public goods' can be  protected&mdash;not for monopoly control by TNCs but for their rapid dissemination  for the alleviation of human suffering.
