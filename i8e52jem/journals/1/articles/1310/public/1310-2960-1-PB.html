				<h4>The Supreme Court Judgment dated May 4, 2001 in the PNDT Act, 1994</h4>
				<p>
					<em>In the Supreme Court of  India, Civil Original Jurisdiction, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 301 of 2000</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>CEHAT, MASUM &amp; Sabu George (Petitioners) v/s Union of India &amp; Others  (Respondents) </em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Order</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unfortunate that  for one reason or the other, the practice of female infanticide still prevails  despite the fact that gentle touch of a daughter and her voice has soothing  effect on the parents. One of the reasons may be the marriage problem faced by  the parents coupled with the dowry demand by the so-called educated and/or rich  persons who are well placed in the society. The traditional system of female  infanticide whereby female baby was done away with after birth by poisoning or  letting her choke on husk continues in a different form by taking advantage of  advance medical techniques. Unfortunately, developed medical science is misused  to get rid of a girl child before birth. Knowing full well that it is immoral  and unethical as well as it may amount to an offence, foetus of a girl child is  aborted by qualified and unqualified doctors or compounders. This has affected  overall sex ratio in various States where female infanticide is prevailing  without any hindrance. For controlling the situation, the Parliament in its  wisdom enacted the Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention  of Misuse) Act, 1994 (hereinafter referred to as "the PNDT Act"). The  Preamble, inter alia, provides that the object of the Act is to prevent the misuse  of such techniques for the purpose of pre-natal sex determination leading to  female feoticide and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The  Act came into force from 1st January, 1996.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is apparent that to a large extent, the PNDT Act is not implemented by the  Central Government or by the State Governments. Hence, the petitioners are  required to approach this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.  One of the petitioners is the Centre for Enquiry Into Health and Allied Themes  (CEHAT), which is a research centre of Anusandhan Trust based in Pune and  Mumbai. Second petitioner is Mahila Sarvangeen Utkarsh Mandal (MASUM) based in  Pune, Maharashtra and the third petitioner is Dr. Sabu M.George who is having  experience and technical knowledge in the field. After filing of this petition,  this Court issued notices to the concerned parties on 9.5.2000. It took nearly  one year for the various States to file their affidavits in reply / written  submissions. Prima facie it appears that despite the PNDT Act being enacted by  the Parliament five years back, neither the State Governments nor the Central  Government has taken appropriate actions for its implementation. Hence, after  considering the respective submissions made at the time of hearing of this  matter, as suggested by the learned Attorney General for India, Mr. Soli  J.Sorabjee following directions are issued on the basis of various provisions  for the proper implementation of the PNDT Act.
				</p>
				<ol type="I">
					<li>
						<strong>Directions to the Central Government</strong>
					</li>
					<p>
						The Central Government is directed to create public awareness against the  practice of pre-natal determination of sex and female foeticide through  appropriate releases/programmes in the electronic media. This shall also be  done by Central Supervisor/Board ('CSB' for short) as provided under Section 16  (iii) of the PNDT Act.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Central Government is directed to implement with all vigour and zeal the  PNDT Act and the Rules framed in 1996. Rule 15 provides that the intervening  period between two meetings of the Advisor Committees constituted under sub -  section (5) of Section 17 of the PNDT Act to advise the appropriate authority  shall not exceed 60 days. It would be seen that this rule is strictly adhered  to.

						<ol>
							<li>
								Meeting of the CSB  will be held at least once in six moths. [Re. Proviso to Section 9(1)]. The  constitution of the CSB is provided under Section 7. It empowers the Central  Government to appoint ten member under Section 7(2)(e) which includes eminent medical  practitioners including eminent social scientists and representatives of women  welfare organizations. We hope that this power will be exercised so as to  include those persons who can genuinely spare time for implementation of the  Act.

									Complaints received by the appropriate Authorities under the Act and action  taken pursuant thereto.
								</li>
								<li>
									Number and nature of awareness campaigns conducted and results flowing  therefrom
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li>
								The CSB shall examine the necessity to amend the Act keeping in mind  emerging technologies and difficulties encountered in implementation of the Act  and to make recommendations to the Central Government. [Re. Section 16]
							</li>
							<li>
								The CSB shall lay down a code of conduct under section 16(iv) of the Act to  be observed by persons working in bodies specified therein and to ensure its  publication so that public at large can know about it.

				<h4>A Fact Sheet on the "Population Bomb" for Honourable Members of Parliament</h4>
				<p>
					There is no "population bomb". The birth rate is declining naturally in large parts of the country. It is thus not necessary to introduce incentives and disincentives into a family welfare package.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>State policies and Bills proposing incentives and disincentives are in complete disjunction with the National Population Policy and indeed with commitments made by the Government of India at Cairo.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>There is a large and unmet need for health and family planning services in the country as the NPP itself acknowledges. To propose punitive measures in this context is clearly irrational.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					States where a rapid decline of the birth rate has taken place are precisely those states where infant and child mortality rates have earlier shown a decline. This decline of infant and child death rates is not uniform in the country. Indeed a worrying increase has taken place in many states. If population stabilisation is the goal, this is what needs priority attention.
				</p>
				<p>
					The disincentives proposed are anti-poor, anti-dalit and anti-adivasis with these sections having to bear the brunt of the withdrawal of a range of government schemes and benefits precisely meant to ameliorate their conditions of living. For instance the TFR is 3.15 among dalits, 3.06 among STs and 2.66 among OBCs. Barring persons with more than two children from contesting in elections effectively bars representation for large sections of these communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly making a two-child norm conditional for welfare measures deprives these sections disproportionately.
				</p>
				<p>
					The disincentives are also anti-women since women in our country do not enjoy the freedom to decide how many children they will bear. Debarring such women from contesting elections makes a mockery of policies to empower women. Further, they will provide an impetus for sex-selective abortions and female feticide, worsening the already deplorable sex ratio in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposals are also anti-minorities since many minority groups in the country, suffering deprivation, are lagging behind demographically from their more fortunately placed countrymen.
				</p>
				<p>
					By linking performance in family planning to assessment of health functionaries, the health system will suffer a further damage in its credibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposals violate the Directive Principles of the Constitution of India. They are thus deeply anti-democratic and violate several provisions of the Constitution including the right to livelihood, the right to life, the right to privacy among others. They are also violative of several international Covenants that India is signatory to, including the Rights of the Child.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any Member of Parliament wishing to support such measures would be well advised to hold prior consultation with her or his constituency.
