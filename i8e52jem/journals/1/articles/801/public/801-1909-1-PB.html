				</p>
				<p>
					This  article examines available evidence on the efficacy of the US medical  malpractice system to promote safer medicine and adequately compensate patients  wrongfully injured.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Framework  and goals of the system</h4>
				<p>
					The  social goals of malpractice litigation include deterrence against unsafe  practices, compensation for injury through negligence, and exact corrective  justice. The attorney acts as the gatekeeper by evaluating the prospective  plaintiff's story, gauging the costs of bringing the lawsuit, and estimates the  probability of success and the likely award. The functioning of the malpractice  system is efficient in theory; the actual practice is more complicated.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Empirical  research on the malpractice system</h4>
				<p>
					Studies  from different parts of the US showed identical rates of iatrogenic injury  (4%-5% of admissions) and malpractice claims (10%). While only 2% of negligent  injuries resulted in malpractice claims, only 17% of malpractice claims  involved negligence. The key predictor of payment was the plaintiff's degree of  disability. The data reveal a profoundly inaccurate and inefficient mechanism  for distributing com-pensation. Sixty per cent of compen-sation is absorbed by  administrative costs (predominantly legal fees).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  malpractice system's role in improving care is less well studied. Tort law  encourages ordering of tests and procedures of little medical benefit,  primarily for the purpose of reducing medicolegal risk. A new malpractice  insurance crisis has evolved over the past few years in the shadow of a  patient-safety movement precipitated by The Institute of Medicine's 2000 report  on medical errors. The interconnectedness of patient safety and malpractice is  increasingly apparent.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Malpractice  law and patient safety</h4>
				<p>
					There  is a deep-seated tension between the malpractice system and goals of the  patient-safety movement. The problem is one of conflicting cultures: trial  attorneys believe that the threat of litigation makes doctors practise more  safely, but the punitive, individualistic, adversarial approach of tort law is  antithetical to the non-punitive, systems-oriented, cooperative strategies of  the patient-safety movement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transparency  has become the leitmotif of the patient-safety movement: to learn from errors,  we must first identify them; to identify them, we must foster an atmosphere  that is conducive to openness about mistakes. Hospitals and physicians must be  honest with patients about medical errors, report such events to one another  and to regulators, and address methods of prevention. To nurture openness,  experts stress that most errors arise from the faulty systems, not from  clinicians' incompetence or carelessness. In sharp contrast, tort law targets  individual physicians, assigning blame and demanding compensation on the basis  of proof of negligence. Concern about exposure to malpractice litigation  diminishes the interest of the medical profession in patient-safety activities,  as doctors feel that they are being asked to be open about errors with little  or no assurance of legal protection.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Tort  reform</h4>
				<p>
					Conventional  tort reforms can be divided into:
				</p>
				<ol type="A">
					<li>
						Limiting  access to court. Screening panels evaluate the merits of claims before they  reach court.
					</li>
					<li>
						Change  liability rules to reduce the size of payouts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Caps  on damages awards and attorneys' fees.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Critics  of malpractice litigation point out that it is unrealistic to expect that  increased levels of malpractice litigation will promote patient safety or make compen-sation  for injuries more accurate or fair. Also, insurance premiums are dictated as  much by losses that insurance companies suffer as by the size of the payouts  and therefore tort reform may not prevent premium crises.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Reform  of the system</h4>
				<p>
					Over the  past 20 years, a growing sense that the tort system is flawed has led to a  number of alternatives. The leading recommendations include using alternative  mechanisms to resolve disputes, dispensing with negligence as the basis for  compensation (no-fault) and locating responsibility for accidents at the  institutional level (enterprise liability). Most likely, this will result in  another round of conventional tort reforms, which will do little to alleviate  the haphazardness of compensation. Proponents of patient safety will continue  to wrestle with an adversarial litigation system that undermines the goals of  trans-parency and error reduction.

				<h4>Commentary</h4>
				<p>
					In  1992, the Kerala High Court extended the 1986 Consumer Protection Act to  medical malpractice and negligence. While activists and consumer protection  groups welcomed this, most physicians were unanimous in their opposition and  promptly took this to the Supreme Court <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S. The Consumer Protection Act. J Postgrad Med 1992;38:214-5." id="1">(1)</a>. The Kerala High Court's opinion  was upheld by the Supreme Court. Rules were drawn up and appropriate courts  established in all states to handle consumer complaints. While the lay press  has published many accounts of its aftermath, mainstream medical journals have  been surprisingly silent. In contrast, several articles have appeared in the  pages of this Journal <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pilgaokar, A. Doctors and the Consumer Protection Act [Editorial]. Issues in Medical Ethics 1996;4:2." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thomas G. Consummate justice or complete folly?

					Almost  a decade after the High Court ruling, panelists at an annual Tamil Nadu  Orthopaedic Association meeting <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thomas G. Consummate justice or complete folly? Doctors and Consumer Protection Act. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002;10:28." id="3">(3)</a> expressed that the Act was needed as  unethical practices had become common in the medical profession and the Act had  forced an improvement in the equipment of nursing homes. The lawyers on the  panel thought that the present Act needed fine-tuning.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  terms of error reporting, a study examined physician attitudes towards  revealing iatrogenic errors to patients. Doctors at the Apollo Hospitals in New  Delhi and at the University of Chicago Hospital in Chicago were asked to  complete a questionnaire <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Maithel SK. Iatrogenic error and truth telling: a comparison of the United States and India. Issues in Medical Ethics 1998;6:125-7." id="4">(4)</a>, which presented three scenarios: A 75-year-old,  terminally ill patient suffers a cardiac arrest; a 75-year-old, terminally ill  patient suffers a cardiac arrest from an unknown allergy to an antibiotic; and  a 75-year-old, terminally ill patient suffers a cardiac arrest as a result of a  known but forgotten allergy to a prescribed antibiotic. In each case, the  physician is asked whether or not he/she would resuscitate the patient. Who is  informed when a mistake is made? Are there any legal issues that are of concern  when revealing iatrogenic error? Was any training received in medical school on  how to handle mistakes?
				</p>
				<p>
					In  Delhi, 55% would resuscitate the patient in scenario 1. This increased to 87.5%  for scenario 2 and 95% for scenario 3. The corresponding figures for the US  were 50%, 82.5% and 82.5%. In both countries, almost all the doctors felt a  sense of moral duty to resuscitate iatrogenic cardiac arrest. In Delhi, 57.5%  could not identify a hospital department they could report the error to, while  in Chicago 87% would report it to the risk management rather than quality  assurance department. Seventy-five per cent of the Indian and 90% of the US  physicians would report the error to the patient, and 72.5% to the patient's  family also. The most common reason for this was the sense of duty to be honest  with the patient and family. Ninety per cent of the doctors in both countries  were concerned about the legal ramifications. Sixty-five per cent of the Indian  doctors and 50% of the US physicians said they had not received any instruction  during their training on how to handle mistakes. The similarity between the  physicians' responses in the two countries is striking. Despite differences in  the cultural and health care settings, physicians in both countries felt a  moral duty to resuscitate a patient who had suffered an iatrogenic injury.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  malpractice systems in India and the US differ mainly in that in the US such  cases are handled by state courts. Guilt and retribution are determined by a  jury. Faced with the stark contrast of a 'poor' disabled patient against a  'rich' insurance company and doctor, juries often favour the patient and large  awards for pain and suffering are not unusual. In India, special consumer  courts handle the cases. Awards are restricted to actual damages. Thus, the  kind of malpractice insurance crises seen in the US are not likely here. In  addition, lawyers are not permitted to take cases on contingency basis. In  India, doctors continue to have an exalted status, with few patients, even  wealthy ones, questioning their decisions, though this may be changing.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  neither system has the capacity to fairly and accurately identify all errors  and injuries that result. In the US, there is a fledgling patient-safety  movement to reduce the rate of iatrogenic errors with a legal require-ment for  doctors and hospitals to report all errors. At present, there is no move to  link this with a compensation scheme, although many approaches have been  proposed. Dr Sunil Pandya <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK. Compensation by State: eliminating legislation against doctors. Issues in Medical Ethics 1993;1:4." id="5">(5)</a> described the New Zealand practice of  establishing a fund to compensate patients who suffer an injury, whether from  negligence or malpractice. It is time doctors in India take the initiative and  develop similar proposals to self-monitor and report errors not only to reduce  the rate of inappropriate care and negligent injuries but also to establish  fair guidelines for compen-sation of those injured.
