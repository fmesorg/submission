				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					In the shadow of recent proposals for universal healthcare in  India, discussions regarding the impact of private medical care on Indians'  health have taken on a greater urgency. However, our collective attempts to  evaluate the effects of India's growing private medical sector have been  seriously hampered due to a lack of reliable or comprehensive data regarding  (i) the size of the private healthcare sector, and (ii) its patterns of growth,  particularly since the 1980s. As we formulate and assess practical strategies  for a sustainable healthcare future for India in the absence of reliable  statistical data, historians' tools for understanding the recent career of  healthcare in the country merit consideration.
				</p>
				<p>
					To that end, in this article, I examine myths and myth-making  as central to the rise and consolidation of Apollo Hospitals, first in Chennai  and later as a key player in India's recent healthcare history. Using  face-to-face interviews with more than 20 prominent Chennai physicians as well  as published sources, I investigate not only the myths surrounding Apollo and  its founder, but also the manner in which these stories are regularly  circulated within the wider medical community. The case of Apollo is  instructive for two reasons: a) Apollo is seen widely as representing the new  chapter in the history of healthcare in India; and b) Apollo merits attention  on its own, as a case study, to illustrate how corporate hospitals established  after it "manage" their own success story and thereby shape the perceptions of  the common man and professionals alike. In short, I argue that the most  important successes of Apollo Hospitals have been in image management. Given  that much of Apollo's "success story" is based on assumptions and assertions that  crumble under even the most basic historical scrutiny, we would be wise to  regard the corporates' claims of economic promise and therapeutic efficiency  with some scepticism.

				<h4>Apollo and the invention of the "corporate hospital" in India</h4>
				<p>
					At the risk of stating  the obvious, the rise and spread of the Apollo Group of Hospitals from the  1980s matters because it is widely seen to represent the beginning of a new  chapter in the history of healthcare in India: the rise of the corporate  hospital alongside the unfolding of liberalisation in the country. Apollo's  story has been told and retold among physicians, journalists, politicians,  bureaucrats, and members of the general public. In this story, the career of  Apollo Hospitals appears to be nothing short of miraculous: Apollo, in  particular, and India's healthcare sector more generally, figure simultaneously  both as the cause <em>and</em> effect of the country's recent economic  successes. Yet, as this essay argues, this legendary status depends on  accepting a set of assertions that are at best, debatable and at worst, mere  myth. Not only are these stories debatable, they are also dangerous, because  they obscure a set of broader historical processes that both precede and go  beyond any results that can be attributed to one man or one hospital. In the  light of this generally confused state of affairs, it would be useful to begin  with a chronological account, both of the establishment and early history of  Apollo (particularly in Chennai), as well as of the broader context - in terms  of the regional and national provision of healthcare - in which Apollo emerged.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  1980, Dr Pratap Reddy, founder and chairman of Apollo Hospitals Group,  announced that he had acquired a plot of land for the first Apollo hospital,  Apollo Hospitals Chennai, on the centrally located Greams Road. At the time,  the <em>Times of India</em> reported that this was the first of a new chain  of large hospitals <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Special correspondent. Madras hospital to be run as public limited company. Times of India. 1980 Apr 26: p 14." id="1">(1)</a>. This development was significant for three reasons.  First, the Chennai hospital would be the first private limited hospital in  India. Second, in order to move ahead with the financing, Reddy had been given  permission to build a private hospital of a capacity of over 30 beds. Until  then, the law permitted only government or charitable trust hospitals to expand  their bed strength beyond 30 (Chennai doctor 2). Third, this hospital raised  funds through overseas borrowing and was also the first to issue public shares  to finance its establishment <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Maiden public issue for hospital project. Times of India. 1982 Aug 17: p 10." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Consent for new capital issues. Times of India. 1982 Oct 12: p 10." id="3">3)</a>. It was observed at that time that this was  "the first [public offering] of its kind in India for financing a  multispeciality medical centre to be run on corporate lines" <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Apollo Hospitals. Times of India. 1982 Nov 12: p10." id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Chennai hospital was inaugurated amidst much  fanfare in September 1983 by Zail Singh, President of India. It was only in  February 1984 that it started admitting patients <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Concept of corporate hospital catches on: City notes. Times of India. 1984 Dec 14: p10." id="5">(5)</a>. It consolidated its  reputation as the hospital of choice for the city's powerful a few months  later, when MG Ramachandran, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, was  admitted there <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="MGR in hospital after asthmatic attack. Times of India. 1984. Oct 7: p 9." id="6">(6)</a>. By 1988, Apollo Hospitals expanded to Hyderabad, as Reddy  had initially planned. In 1996, Apollo Indraprastha was opened in New Delhi.
				</p>
				<p>
					By 1993, Apollo Hospitals had begun to issue large  advertisements in the national press to congratulate themselves on serving the  nation (see Figure 2 in appendix). At the time of writing this article in 2013,  Apollo has undertaken the task of continued expansion in India and beyond. The  year 2013 also marks three decades of the existence of Apollo, and the occasion  is to be celebrated by the Group with commemorative volumes by and about Reddy.  One of the recent promotional pieces summed up Apollo's achievements as  follows:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						From one multispeciality facility that he  founded in Chennai 30 years ago to 54 hospitals, 1600 pharmacies, 60 diagnostic  clinics and 11 nursing colleges in 2013, Dr Reddy's medical system attracts  more than 100,000 footfalls daily across India. Cumulatively, more than 32  million people have been treated at various Apollo hospitals <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupte P. Transforming India's health-care landscape. The Hindu. 2013 Feb 5 [cited 2013 Aug 20].

				<h4>Apollo: myths and myth-making</h4>
				<p>
					Despite a wide range of opinions regarding the rise of the  corporate hospital, there are many similarities in the manner in which its  significance is described both by supporters and critics. An admirer recently  wrote:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						In 1983, at a time when the government's  commitment to investing in public healthcare appeared to be flagging, Prathap  Chandra Reddy did something unthinkable: he launched the country's first  corporate medical system. Three decades on, the argument over the pros and cons  of privatised healthcare in a poor country remains unsettled but there is one  thing Dr Reddy's admirers and critics both agree on: the emergence and rise of  his company, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, has altered the health-care  landscape of India <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupte P. Transforming India's health-care landscape. The Hindu. 2013 Feb 5 [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.thehindu. com/opinion/op-ed/transforming-indias-healthcare-landscape/ article4379314.ece" id="7">(7)</a>.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Compare this with the sentiment of a critic of Apollo:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I would say that what I noticed during the past  thirty years, which is the time I have been practising medicine, the big change  is that when we were undergraduates, there were no private hospitals in  Chennai. There were private nursing homes which was [a] big difference. Because  nursing homes wouldn't take acutely ill patients. They would only take elective  surgical procedures; very mild illnesses. Anything serious was referred to the  government teaching hospitals. Obviously the three: Kilpauk Medical College,  Stanley Medical College, and the biggest, Government General Hospital. If you had a serious illness, [in] those days  it was considered that the place to go to was Government General Hospital. It all changed after Apollo (Chennai Doctor 1).
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Yet  the claim that "Apollo changed everything" fails to bear the weight of  scrutiny. It would be useful to disaggregate the "It all changed after Apollo"  myth into its five key elements:
				</p>
				<p>
					Apollo came up at a time that healthcare for "ordinary  Indians" was flagging.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apollo provided a new model of healthcare delivery in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					At its heart, Apollo is a patriotic project.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to establish Apollo, its chairman, Prathap Reddy,  single-handedly changed government policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apollo was an immediate success.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  light of this descriptive convergence among both admirers and critics, the rest  of this section attempts to describe and assess these five elements of the "It  all changed after Apollo" myth.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h5>Apollo came up at a time when  healthcare for "ordinary Indians" was flagging</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Talking about Reddy, a doctor whom I interviewed claimed, "When he set up Apollo Hospitals in Chennai in 1983, private healthcare institutions were virtually unknown to the country" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Interview with Prathap Reddy, Apollo Hospitals. Indian Medicos BlogSpot. 2010 Oct 6[cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.indian-medicos.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/interview-with-prathap-reddy-apollo.html\ " id="8">(8)</a> This aspect of the myth of Apollo is often articulated through three sub-claims: 1a) that there was no reasonable healthcare available in Chennai, 1b) that the government, in particular, had either abdicated or was simply unable to fulfil its responsibility to provide healthcare for ordinary Indians, and that, therefore, 1c) only the very rich had access to high-quality healthcare, for which they travelled abroad.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let  us consider these in turn.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>1a. There  was no good healthcare available in Chennai for "ordinary" Indians</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Although  this claim is oft-repeated (that before the establishment of Apollo and other  corporate hospitals in Chennai, there was no good quality healthcare in the  city for so-called ordinary Indians), it is difficult to find evidence to  support this claim. For the sake of simplicity, let us leave aside the vexed  question of who an "ordinary Indian" is (as well as the even more vexed  question of whether or not she is well served by corporate medical institutions  in Chennai today). Whilst historians have yet to fully document the city's  medical past, physicians from Chennai have described in interviews how the city  has been the long-standing home of high-quality medical care and medical  education in India. Chennai's reputation as a "healthcare hub" far precedes the  opening of Apollo Hospitals in 1983-1984. One of the doctors whom I  interviewed, and who was closely associated with the Tamil Nadu branch of the  Indian Medical Association, estimated that the city was home to approximately  400 hospitals and 10,000 beds.
					</p>
					<p>
						The phrase repeatedly used  both by physicians in interviews and newspaper journalists to describe the cluster of medical facilities in Chennai is  "medical mecca."The use of this term is based on a detailed consideration of  the various aspects of excellence in the medical sphere, including: medical  education and large government hospitals; a cluster of private nursing homes  run by prominent physicians (particularly along Poonamallee High Road);  excellent connections to national transport infrastructure; nodes of specialist  expertise; and a reputation for the provision of ethical treatment at  reasonable fees.
					</p>
					<p>
						That  the medical education provided in and around Chennai is of a high quality is  common knowledge. Three medical colleges in the region are consistently ranked  in the top ten nationally. These are the Christian Medical College in Vellore  (established in 1902 and affiliated to Madras University in 1942), Jawaharlal  Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in Pondicherry  (established in 1823 and re-developed in 1956), and Madras Medical College in  Chennai (established in 1850).The students graduating from these institutions  not only staff large teaching hospitals, but also go onto to staff and manage  the small, medium and large hospitals across Chennai.
					</p>
					<p>
						Further, Chennai is famous for the high quality of  treatment and research carried out in a number of its government hospitals.  Special mention may be made of the Government General Hospital (established in  1664), and Stanley Hospital (established in1792). Other hospitals of note included  the Southern Railway Headquarters Hospital in Perambur (date of establishment  not available),Vijaya Hospital (established in 1972), KJ Hospital and MV  Diabetes Hospital <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Special correspondent. Is Madras fast becoming...The medical capital? Madras Musings. 1991 Dec 1-14 [cited 2013 Sep 3];1(16):1. Available from: http://madrasmusings.com/older-archives/Vol%201/Vol%20I%20 -%20No%2016.pdf" id="9">(9)</a>. The same high standards of quality are maintained by  several high-profile voluntary and charitable trust hospitals as well. These  include the Voluntary Health Society (established in 1958), the Cancer  Institute (established in1954), and Sankara Nethralaya (established in 1978).  Speaking of the high standards of government hospitals, one physician said:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>When I went to medical school [1970s], MMC  was still the place you went to if you had complicated illnesses. Even private  doctors would do hernias and gall bladders outside. But if you needed cancer  surgery... they'd say: "Hey, listen come to the government hospitals. They are  better equipped to do all those. We are academic centres" (Chennai doctor 2).</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Another physician echoed these sentiments:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"...I think more and more people joined medical  college in Madras. It was considered to be, you know, the place to go to. So it  had that reputation of being something, even right from the first days..."</em> (Chennai doctor 7).
					</p>
					<p>
						Apart  from the extensive medical infrastructure in and around Chennai in terms of  medical education and large government hospitals, over the 20th century, the  city also became famous for its large number of private nursing homes, run by  prominent physicians. These private nursing homes included the Pandalai Nursing  Home, Sundaravadanam Nursing Home and Kumaran Nursing Home. Nearly every doctor  I interviewed mentioned that, particularly from the 1960s onwards, Chennai's  Poonamallee High Road came to be India's "Harley Street" among doctors and  patients across India. Nevertheless, none of this is apparent in the awestruck  assessment of Reddy and Apollo Hospitals cited below (an assessment which is  very common).
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>[Reddy's] plan for the creation of a nationwide  hospital system in the corporate sector may not seem extraordinary today when  private medicine has made major inroads across the country but it was dramatic  30 years ago... When he set up Apollo Hospitals in Chennai in 1983, private  healthcare institutions were virtually unknown in the country <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupte P. Transforming India's health-care landscape. The Hindu. 2013 Feb 5 [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.thehindu. com/opinion/op-ed/transforming-indias-healthcare-landscape/ article4379314.ece" id="7">(7)</a>.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet, rather than being "virtually unknown", Chennai's private  hospitals and nursing homes were part of a larger regional and national trend  of an expanding private medical sector, a trend which emerged around 1960. As  Bhat observes, "Private healthcare expenditure in India has grown at 12.5% per  annum since 1960-70" <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhat R (1996). Regulating the private healthcare sector: the case of the Indian consumer protection act. Health Policy Plan. 1996:11(3):272." id="10">(10)</a>. In rural India, the number of small private  treatment facilities increased threefold between 1984 and 1992 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhat R (1999). Characteristics of private medical practice in India: A provider perspective. Health Policy Plan. 1999;14(1):27." id="1">(11)</a>. Similarly,  in the small city of Mangalore in south-west India, the number of  moderate-sized nursing homes jumped from six in 1986 to 20 in 1994, and to 32 <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nichter M, Van Sickle D.

Further, as Nicher and Van Sickle point out, "In the 1980s, small  private labs began springing up in towns and cities..." <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nichter M, Van Sickle D.

Armonk, New York and London: ME Sharpe; 2002. p184-5." id="12">(12)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						As  home to a good number of highly-trained physicians, whether practising  privately or in government institutions, Chennai became well known as a centre  of excellence in particular specialist areas. One doctor summed up what many  others noted:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Historically, Chennai is the healthcare  capital of India... for whatever reason the primary centre is always started in  and around Chennai. Cardiac units, neurosurgical units, orthopaedic units;  anything that starts in India and healthcare first seems to be able to kick off  in Chennai and then to somewhere else. Dr B Ramamurthy was the legend of his time -a first world-class  neurosurgical centre that he put up in the seventies (Incomplete)... Like that,  the Cancer Institute in Adyar still has a reputation for being a good oncology  centre... In ophthalmology, [Sankara] Nethralaya is a world-class centre</em> (Chennai doctor 2).
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, many physicians noted that the practice of  medicine in Chennai was marked by a high level of professional ethics, combined  with relatively low costs. One doctor observed: "A kind of good temperament is  there in most of the senior doctors in Chennai, they want to be helpful not  necessarily just make money" (Chennai doctor 3) Another doctor elaborated on  this theme: "Medicine really exploded during the post-war years. And Madras had  the reputation that it tended to be a little bit more conservative. The Bombay  person is always a little bit more of an entrepreneur"(Chennai doctor 12).In  this conversation, the doctor equated a broader cultural conservatism with a  higher level of professional probity.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>1b. Apollo came up at a time when government  support for healthcare for ordinary Indians was flagging</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Just  as with the claim that good-quality healthcare was virtually unavailable for  ordinary Indians before Apollo, the claim that Apollo "filled a gap" in the  provision of healthcare due to the lack of government support is difficult to  sustain. This is particularly the case when one considers the overwhelming  evidence to the contrary. There was a substantial government health  infrastructure in Tamil Nadu before the establishment of either Apollo or any  other corporate hospital in Chennai.
					</p>
					<p>
						As  part of a larger project of widening and strengthening the health  infrastructure in India, primary health centres and sub-centres were introduced  as the "rural health" component of the Minimum Needs Programme during the Fifth  Five-Year Plan (1974-1978). As Duggal explains: "During the 1980s, the public  health spending peaked and this was reflected in major health infrastructure  expansion in rural India via the Minimum Needs Programme" <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Duggal R. Tracing privatisation of healthcare in India [Internet]. Express healthcare management. ResearchGate.net. 2004 Apr 1 15[cited 2013 Aug 24]. Available from:http://www.researchgate.net/" id="13">(13)</a>. Tamil Nadu was  particularly successful in its attempts to implement the programme for building  health infrastructure. As Muraleedharan et al narrate: "Tamil Nadu embraced the  concept whole-heartedly and built the facilities much faster than almost all  other states" <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Muraleedharan V R, Dash U, Gilson L. Tamil Nadu 1980-2005: a success story in India. In: Balabanova D, McKee M, Mills A, editors. Good health atlow cost 25 years on: what makes a successful health system? [Internet]. London: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; 2011 [cited 2013 Aug 24]:p173. Available from: http://ghlc.lshtm.ac.uk/" id="14">(14)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						However,  there is also a possibility that Tamil Nadu was able to capitalise on the rural  health agenda of the Minimum Needs Programme, at least in part, because it had  already launched a robust programme of health planning <em>prior to</em> the implementation of the Minimum Needs Programme. KS Sanjivi (doyen of  Chennai's voluntary health sector, b. 1903-d. 1994) claimed in 1973 that Tamil  Nadu was one of the few states which had the requisite number of primary health  centres, complete with the medical and paramedical personnel needed <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sanjivi KS. Excellent health and medical services. Times of India. 1973 May 22: p 20." id="15">(15)</a>. In 1973,  Sanjivi explained:
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>The government of Tamil Nadu was the first to  constitute a state planning commission with a task force on health ... presided  over by Malcolm Adiseshiah... [It] divided itself into working parties to  consider in depth the problems of health services, medical education, family  planning, nutrition, sanitation, the role of voluntary organisations and  indigenous medicines, including homeopathy. It handed over its report to the  Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M Karunanidhi, in 1972</em> <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sanjivi KS. Excellent health and medical services. Times of India. 1973 May 22: p 20." id="15">(15)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Taken  together, the pre-existing government health infrastructure and the policies  prioritising planning for the provision of primary and tertiary healthcare did  much to contribute to the growth of <em>all</em> healthcare  in Chennai, well in advance of the establishment of Apollo.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whereas  the role of Apollo may constitute a part of these larger trends, it would be  erroneous to claim that it could have served as a catalyst for them. Many of  the doctors interviewed pointed out that it was, in fact, the long-standing  healthcare infrastructure in and around Chennai that created a client base for  private medicine. Several doctors drew attention to the fact that, particularly  by the 1980s, the region's population had been sensitised to the importance of  good healthcare "habits", such as visiting doctors to address their health  concerns. It is also to be noted that the relatively higher levels of  development in Chennai and across Tamil Nadu over a long period meant that even  before liberalisation, the state was home to a comparatively large middle class  population which could afford specialist care in Chennai.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>1c. Apollo triumphed because it provided  what was up till then unavailable in India or for Indians</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						This  aspect of the Apollo myth claims that good-quality healthcare was out of the  reach of Indians, except those who were very, very rich. The corollary claim is  that those who could afford international travel went either to the UK or to  the USA for specialist, life-saving treatment. The following is an excerpt from  an interview with a doctor from Chennai, and what he says is typical of what  many physicians reported:
					</p>
					<p>
						Chennai  doctor7<em>... I mean, they were doing excellent work. But  there was always this thing that if you were a VIP you got good  treatment,whereas if you were a common man you didn't get such good treatment.  And the hospital could have been a lot cleaner. So that was one thing that did  put people off. Now suddenly here was a place where everybody could go to. I  mean not everybody - people who could afford it, and who did not want to go to  a GH [General Hospital] could come here.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						SH  (author): <em>Instead of going abroad</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Chennai  doctor 7: <em>Yes. Now let's talk about the heart. Everybody  who needed a bypass would go to the US. Now suddenly here was a place that one  could go to. You didn't have to go there.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						This  claim, however, fails to take into account some basic developments in India's  economic history. In the mid-1980s, the cost of international travel rose  astronomically for Indians. This was because of changes in the exchange rate  and, in particular, radical devaluing of the rupee, particularly by the late  1980s. It was at precisely the same time as overseas medical travel became  prohibitively expensive that Apollo began to announce dividends via newspaper  articles. In other words, it is worth considering that Apollo did not create a  market, but stumbled into one.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>The emergence and rise of Apollo was  a catalyst for a new model of healthcare delivery in India</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						This  claim is predicated on the corollary claim that Apollo was quickly emulated by  many others in the private healthcare sector. Certainly, the story of Apollo  can be described as that of the emergence and rise of <em>one</em> corporate hospital chain in India. To be fair, from the very beginning,  Apollo's promoters planned Apollo not as a single institution, but as a <em>chain</em> of  large private hospitals <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="[Advertisement]. Times of India. 1980 Apr 26: p 14." id="16">(16)</a>. This was, indeed, a new concept in India in terms  of the scale, organisation and delivery of private healthcare. What is less  clear, however, is the degree to which Apollo served as a <em>catalyst</em> for the successful emergence of other large private hospitals and hospital  chains across India.
					</p>
					<p>
						In  claiming that Apollo served as a catalyst for other private hospitals and  chains to emerge, many assume that Apollo was an <em>immediate</em> success. However, Apollo took at least five years (and most likely, many more)  before it made any dividends. Further, there was a substantial gap (at least 15  years) between the inauguration of Apollo in 1983 and the establishment of  other large, successful Indian hospital chains that continue to be in existence  today. Nevertheless, Apollo did make waves in the early years. As early as  1991, Chennai was hailed as the"corporate healthcare" city of India, though it  had only a total of <em>four</em> large private hospitals (compared to the approximately 20 that we have today).  In 1995, one journalist celebrated Chennai's achievement thus:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Madras is the new "mecca of medicine"... In the  last five years the hospital services sector has boomed in this city, though  "for profit" hospitals exist elsewhere in the country, Madras is the only city  with four corporate hospitals <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Umashankar G. The marketing of health. Times of India. 1995 Jan 15: p A1." id="17">(17)</a>.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Indeed the 1990s was a time of relative early growth, and,  soon after this article was published, Chennai had six corporate hospitals:  Tamilnad Hospital, Devaki Hospital, Malar Hospital, Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital  (which went public in 1994), and Chennai Kaliappa Hospital, in addition to  Apollo. One of the obvious factors to reckon with was, and still is, that  starting a corporate hospital requires immense funds. One of the doctors interviewed observed that  "the gestation period for a hospital is five to seven years, minimum, before it  can make a profit," (Chennai doctor 6). As one physician explained:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							When you borrow money [for a hospital], you're  asked to repay like an industry in like five years. [But] you cannot pay back  in healthcare in the five years. Absolutely impossible. So what then happens is that people take the massive amount  of money. [But] modern medical technology depreciates in four years. At the end  of the fifth year, you have junk, it's scrap...(Chennai doctor 2).
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The  following tale of Tamilnad Hospital illustrates how, while it was one thing to  open a corporate hospital, it was quite another to keep it going or to turn a  profit.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>From Tamilnad  to Global</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Tamilnad  Hospital was incorporated in 1984 by a US-based non-resident Indian, Dr CP  Velusamy. In 1985, it became a public limited company. In 1991, Tamilnad  Hospital issued public shares in order to finance the cost of setting up what  was at that time described as "the first phase" -a 250-bed hospital in  Perumbakkam, which was in south suburban Chennai and quite remote in those days <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Company profile.

In 2000, after a protracted labour dispute, Tamilnad Hospital faced a  mass walk-out of physicians <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Warrier S G.

Following the labour unrest, as well as a  lengthy delay in the hospital's plans to start a medical college jointly with  the Kanchi <em>math</em> nearby,  Tamilnad Hospitals folded up. In 2003, the Kanchi <em>math</em> took over the hospital through its deemed university at Kancheepuram. The  hospital was rechristened the Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Sankara Medical Hospital <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Balasubramanian V.

However, in 2006, Sankara Hospital admitted defeat in being able to make  the venture profitable and applied to sell the hospital, explaining that in its  expansion to 450 beds on the 46 acre site, it had become untenable financially.  In 2007 in an all-cash deal worth Rs 257crore, Sankara Hospital was bought by  Global Hospitals and was renamed Global Health City, which is what it is known  as today as well <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shetty S K.

					</p>
					<p>
						In short, whilst Apollo was the first, it is far from clear  whether it paved the way for other large, private hospitals in Chennai, or  whether other large, private hospitals found it easy to succeed. If anything,  time has shown that the largest organisations tend to survive, given that they  can do business (and spread losses) across economies of scale.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>At its heart, Apollo is a patriotic  project</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The  assertion that Apollo is a symbol and an institution representative of the  greatness of the Indian nation is a truism. Statements on this aspect of the  Apollo myth are often repeated and it is this angle that the Apollo Hospitals  Group promotes the most vigorously in its publicity material and media  appearances. As Prathap Reddy regularly emphasises in his many interviews to  the media, "...bringing the best healthcare within the reach of every patient is  our mission and [at Apollo] we are determined to make it a reality" <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manian R. Heart to Heart. Culturama. 2010;1(5):16." id="22">(22)</a>.  However, this claim addresses an implicit criticism. That is, one often hears  worried murmurings, even among physicians employed by Apollo, of how for-profit  medicine may be profit-driven. The anxiety is that profits in medicine make for  bad medicine and a deterioration in morals, which would be particularly  deleterious to patients in India, a nation still wracked by dire poverty. In  framing the business of Apollo as a service to the nation, this criticism is  neutralised.
					</p>
					<p>
						Apollo  Hospital not only neutralises the criticism of for-profit medicine, but also  often presents Prathap Reddy's very pursuit of profit (whether in healthcare or  other ventures) as patriotic. Mostly, this claim of patriotism is paired with  praise for the service Apollo Hospital provides to middle-class consumers. One  of Reddy's recent interviewers wrote, "[Reddy's] is the story of one man who  set out to revolutionise the unaddressed healthcare needs of a section of  India's growing middle class. It is a tale of manoeuvring through difficult  bureaucratic and complex medical systems" <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupte P. Transforming India's health-care landscape. The Hindu. 2013 Feb 5 [cited 2013 Aug 20].

					</p>
					<p>
						Indeed,  much of the retrospective publicity concerning Reddy and the establishment of  the first Apollo highlights a series of meetings he had with Indira Gandhi, and  later, Rajiv Gandhi. The accounts of these meetings portray Reddy as one who  aimed to help save the nation from what was seen as stifling regulation and  bureaucracy. These accounts regularly include a version of the following story:  "I told Mrs Gandhi only the rich and powerful get access to healthcare and she  really gave the first impetus by telling everybody, 'Here's a man who wants to  reverse the brain drain'" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Interview with Prathap Reddy, Apollo Hospitals.

However, no one mentions the fact that Indira  Gandhi, who is regularly credited with evaluating the overall effect of the  first Apollo, died within the first year of its establishment. Of Mrs Gandhi's  endorsement of Apollo Hospitals, another of Reddy's interviewers wrote:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							The new hospital attracted the best medical  talent, including eminent non-resident Indian doctors who returned to India  from hospitals in the US and UK. This prompted then Prime Minister Indira  Gandhi to remark,  "Dr Reddy you have brought talent back to India and reversed the brain drain" <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Financial express interviews Dr Prathap C Reddy.

						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Reddy  regularly remarked that "...the man who really changed the face of healthcare in  this country with his vision and clarity was none other than Rajiv Gandhi - by  opening up hospitals to funding and other opportunities" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Interview with Prathap Reddy, Apollo Hospitals. Indian Medicos BlogSpot. 2010 Oct 6[cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.indian-medicos.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/interview-with-prathap-reddy-apollo.html" id="8">(8)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, when Reddy was preparing to open Apollo in 1982, his  statements regarding the national role that the hospital was expected to play  were substantially different from the stories we hear today. In 1982, a  newspaper reported that Apollo was an institution primarily intended to serve  foreigners travelling to India from the Gulf for medical treatment:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							A hospital being built under the corporate  sector here expects a steady flow of rich Arab clients and a huge inflow of  foreign exchange, since the Arabs are not satisfied with the facilities offered  in the Bombay hospitals. Dr Prathap Reddy, chairman of the company behind the  venture, told newsmen here yesterday that many rich Arabs had told him that  they wanted to be picked up from the airport to the hospital and all  investigations and treatment should be done under one roof, regardless of cost <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hospital to earn foreign exchange. Times of India. 1982 Dec 1: p 6." id="24">(24)</a>.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						In this early iteration, Apollo would serve the Indian nation  - not by ministering to Indians -but by ministering to India's foreign exchange  reserves. The avowal of such objectives echoed a statement Reddy had made  slightly earlier, in which he had disclosed that the government recognised the  Apollo venture as a "core economic activity" because it (the government) was  aware of the potential of healthcare to attract foreign exchange <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="[Advertisement]. Times of India. 1982 Apr 15: p6." id="25">(25)</a>. It should  be evident that this quote is at odds with the avowed aim of Reddy and Apollo  that has been commemorated subsequently. Reddy and Apollo Hospitals have been  honoured with the highest accolades that the Indian nation can bestow. Reddy  received a Padma Bhushan in 1991 (India's third highest civilian honour) and a  Padma Vibhushan in 2010 (India's second highest civilian honour).The Indian  Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in honour of Apollo Hospitals in  2009.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5> In order to establish Apollo, Reddy  changed state practices single-handedly </h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Many  go on from the assertion that Apollo was a trailblazer, that too the only one,  in crafting a new future for medicine in India, to claim that Reddy effected  these changes by dint of his personal charisma. According to these accounts,  Reddy charmed the "Delhi Durbar" under successive prime ministers during the  1980s with the sheer persuasiveness of his argument that his was a  national/populist project.
					</p>
					<p>
						Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi figure prominently in these  accounts. One newspaper reported: "Banks were not willing to fund hospitals.  Apollo approached the Centre and found a patient listener in the then Prime  Minister, Indira Gandhi. The healthcare sector gained industry status, and  access to financial markets" <a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Financial Chronicle highlights Apollo Hospitals as the Greek god in Indian healthcare. Apollohospitals.com [Internet].2011Jan 10 [cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.apollohospitals.com/mediafeatures-detail.php?newsid=2" id="26">(26)</a>. Referring to 1989 when Rajiv Gandhi was the  Prime Minister, another interviewer made the following claims:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							...On Reddy's representation, the former (Rajiv  Gandhi)amended in three days in the Parliament and removed all hardships  leading to liberal funding And so the costliest medical equipments made  inroads[sic] into Indian hospitals and were equipped on par with the western.  Rajiv Gandhi also gave a tax exemption of Rs 10,000 [on medical equipment] <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ethiraj G.

						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Finally,  another interviewer risks over-egging the pudding, exceeding even Reddy's and  Apollo's own claims: "Often referred to as the father of modern healthcare in  India - after all, he revolutionised healthcare in India when the country was  mired in babudom" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Interview with Prathap Reddy, Apollo Hospitals. Indian Medicos BlogSpot. 2010 Oct 6[cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.indian-medicos.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/interview-with-prathap-reddy-apollo.html" id="8">(8)</a>. Reddy himself was quoted as having said the following of  the first Apollo:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							...securing licences to import 370-odd medical  equipment for the hospital itself took two years. Meanwhile, lowering of import  duty on life-saving medical equipment also helped private healthcare during the  pre-reform era. The duties came down from 100% to 5-6% over the years <a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Financial Chronicle highlights Apollo Hospitals as the Greek god in Indian healthcare.

						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						The  claims regarding the transformation brought about by Reddy ignore and obscure  the fact that the pre-existing economic climate had already been in the process  of changing. Reddy takes credit for these changes, in particular,  liberalisation, first under Indira Gandhi in the early 1980s and then under  Rajiv Gandhi in the late 1980s. This aspect of the myth also underplays the  increasingly active role of associations such as the Federation of Indian  Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Confederation of Indian  Industry (CII).
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Apollo was an immediate success</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The popular perception is that upon its establishment in  1983, Apollo was an immediate success in terms of therapeutic outcomes and  profit margins. The publicity circulated by Apollo Hospitals gives one to  believe the same. As one of the doctors who was interviewed emphasised,  "[Apollo] was a place where you could be confident you get every kind of  treatment under one roof. And it was available for a price, but it was there.  The quality was there. That was right from the beginning. It was a foregone  thing. It just took off" (Chennai doctor 7). Many attribute the success to  Reddy's visionary nature. Another doctor declared, "Apollo succeeded because  Reddy could see what was coming"(Chennai doctor 8). However, this was not the  case, as is clear both from Apollo's own attempts to secure funding through  further public share issues to underwrite further expansion, as well as the  struggle of other hospitals to thrive within the same market (Chennai).

				<h4>Conclusion: the trouble with myths for writing policy</h4>
				<p>
					Alongside biotechnology and information technology, corporate healthcare is given pride of place  within India's current "sunshine story." These industries are taken to be  examples of the country's capacity to deliver and are given much of the credit  for the nation's recent economic successes. Indeed, according to a recent KPMG  report, rising income levels, changing demographics and shifts in disease  profile were expected to double the size of spending on healthcare by 2012 <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="KPMG. Emerging trends in healthcare: A journey from bench to bedside. KPMG.com [Internet]. 2011 Feb17 [cited 2013 Aug 24]. Available from: http://www.kpmg.com/in/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/pages/emergingtrendsinhealthcare-ajourneyfrombenchtobedside.aspx" id="28">(28)</a>. The industrial barons leading these fields both drive new economic policies  and profit from these new policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking  ahead at the role that corporates are poised to play, one final point regarding  the form and meaning of medicine, as well as myths in this sphere in the era of  liberalisation, requires critical scrutiny, particularly in the light of the  current government's pursuit of universal health care. That is the claim that  corporate "multi-speciality" and "super-speciality" hospitals both constitute  an innovation in the delivery of healthcare, and the corollary of this, ie that  corporate hospitals provide an extremely  broad range of high-quality medical services and, as such, a template for  healthcare delivery to the nation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I  found that there was widespread agreement, particularly among the doctors I  interviewed, with the view that multi-speciality corporate hospitals represent  an innovation in the delivery of healthcare. One doctor explained the  significance of multi-speciality large private hospitals thus:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Suppose a specialist - I am talking about  20 years back - suppose you are an eye specialist. You will have an eye  hospital. Or you are a surgeon. You will have a surgical hospital. But the  corporates changed that. Apollo Hospital changed that concept. They said, "All  departments under one roof" That was the concept (Chennai doctor 10).
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Another  doctor echoed this view:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						[Apollo] was a place where you could be  confident you could get every kind of treatment under one roof... Suddenly people found that here was a place  that, you know, they had all kinds of specialities. That was the first hospital  that actually even had specialists coming in (Chennai doctor 7).
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Listening to these accounts, I failed to see what was so  innovative. Surely, I thought to myself, the concept that one hospital could  treat an entire range of ailments was the <em>foundational idea</em> of hospital  medicine, as it emerged in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  Many claim that the multispeciality  hospital provided something new, but surely this was simply a shinier imitation  of the government and charitable institutions which were already in existence  and which, too, were based on a long-standing model of comprehensive clinical  investigation and treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					But  the problem with this misconception is beyond a basic amnesia for medical  history. The problem with the celebration of the corporate multispeciality  version of hospital care is a lack of recognition of the fact that, over the  past three decades, this form of the delivery of healthcare has succeeded only  due to its selectiveness. Indeed, even some ofthe doctors who praised the  hospital's supposedly "innovative" model of care simultaneously recognised that  most multispeciality hospitals succeeded both financially as well as in  healthcare delivery, because they made very selective and strategic choices  about their investments in specialisations. These specialisations allowed for  very high success rates for very specific procedures, which could facilitate a  high patient throughput and a corollary income stream.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  this context, we could consider the example of the Railways Hospital in  Chennai. Railways offered excellent services for patients with heart-related  ailments. However, because of the wide cross-section of the population that  this hospital was built to serve, the heart specialists there were able to  develop expertise not only in coronary bypass surgery, for example, but also in  the much riskier areas of paediatric cardiac surgery and the heart ailments  suffered disproportionately by the poor (eg rheumatic heart diseases that do  not necessitate open heart surgery).
				</p>
				<p>
					Mistaking the "comprehensive care" that the corporate  hospitals claim to deliver for a genuinely comprehensive care is a dangerous  mistake. It is evident that there is a big difference between the comprehensive  care of universal health care proposals and that that large government  hospitals have historically provided. This is particularly clear if one  considers what corporate hospitals are  being asked to, and poising themselves to, deliver to the general population of  India under the universal health care proposals. Neither these hospitals, nor  the Government of India has suggested that corporate hospitals should become  involved in public (or "preventative") healthcare. But why not? One profile of  Reddy says, "...As Dr Reddy himself acknowledges, primary healthcare should be  the responsibility of the government, which has both the resources and manpower  to reach all parts of the country" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Interview with Prathap Reddy, Apollo Hospitals. Indian Medicos BlogSpot. 2010 Oct 6[cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.indian-medicos.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/interview-with-prathap-reddy-apollo.html" id="8">(8)</a>.Yet how can healthcare be either  universal or comprehensive in the absence of primary health care? Corporate  health care has a proven track record of offering quality care, but only in  highly specific -and highly revenue-generating-procedures, such as heart bypass  surgery. The costly business of primary healthcare is to be left entirely to a  system that many consider already over-burdened and under-funded. Nevertheless,  Reddy's confidence that corporates should not shoulder more comprehensive care  has been accepted by many of today's leaders <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="KPMG.

Reddy describes his goal thus: "My vision for  the Apollo Hospitals Group is to touch a billion lives, and I am sure we will  fulfil the dream" <a class="reference" href="#tentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manian R.
