					The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
					(SARS) earlier this year led to some drastic measures in
					the name of public health, including the quarantining of
					patients and contacts, public naming of SARS patients,
					and threats of severe legal penalties for non-compliance.
					Some of these measures conflicted with basic human
					rights, and raise ethical concerns. We believe that SARS
					did present an unusual combination of features, but none
					of those features was individually unique or without precedent.
					Existing legal and ethical principles may be applied
					to each of the questions arising from such an outbreak,
					and authorities should be guided by those principles
					rather than short-term considerations.

				<h4>The SARS epidemic</h4>
				<p>
					The panic engendered by the outbreak of SARS is nothing
					new in the arena of infectious disease. One need only
					consider the precedents offered by leprosy, bubonic
					plague, sexually transmissible infections including HIV/
					AIDS and influenza pandemics to understand that fear
					(rational or otherwise) and infectious disease march hand
					in hand. Governments and community leaders need to
					act on the best evidence available and protect the rights
					and well-being of all citizens including those who may
					be unwell. Unfortunately, the opposite is commonly the
					case.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, authorities did little to quell the concerns of the
					population. As was noted in an earlier edition of this
					Journal, 'the authorities' methods created confusion, used
					coercion and spread panic. Suspected patients were banished
					to infectious disease hospitals, like criminals to
					jail. Most of them were ignorant of their medical problem-
					some did not even know whether they had tested
					positive <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S. SARS: infectious diseases, public health and medical ethics. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:70-1." id="1">(1)</a>.

				<p>
					In China, the Supreme Court declared that intentionally
					spreading disease and endangering public security or leading
					to serious injury, death or heavy loss of private property
					was punishable by imprisonment or death. Officials
					guilty of negligently allowing the disease to spread could
					face three years in gaol <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="SARS: China's threat of the death penalty. ABC Asia Pacific, http://abcasiapacific.com/focus/sars/feature_2.htm." id="2">(2)</a>. A man in Northern China was

					prevention team following a prohibition on people enteringentering

					Such incidents occurred all over the world. Singapore
					enacted stringent laws to deal with those breaching quarantine
					orders <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jail for those who repeatedly break quarantine orders; New laws to be put in place to curb irresponsible behaviour.

				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, it should be noted that, the Equal Opportunities
					Commission in Hong Kong responded quickly
					to complaints of SARS-related discrimination <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Battle Against SARS and Discrimination Equal OpportunitiesCommission Hong Kong. www.eoc.org.hk/ME/newsletter/issue26/sars.htm." id="8">(8)</a>.

			<div class="section">
				<h4>What is SARS?</h4>
				<p>
					SARS appears to be a completely new disease. Progress
					in understanding it has been rapid, and the causative agent
					is now believed to be a novel coronavirus, but much remains
					to be discovered.
				</p>
				<p>
					A patient can be a 'suspected' case if he/she has fever,
					cough or respiratory symptoms, and some epidemiological
					link to another SARS case (personal contact or residence
					in an affected area). Added X-ray changes or a positive
					laboratory test puts the patient into the 'probable'
					category. Significantly, there is still no 'confirmed' category
					of SARS diagnosis-even now that the virus is
					known, the tests available cannot be relied upon either to
					confirm or exclude the diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					These non-specific case definitions have become even
					more problematic now that the recognised outbreak has
					ended; one of the strongest features of the outbreak was
					the apparent absence of asymptomatic transmission, and
					thus the ability to link new cases to known prior cases. At
					least one patient presents to any major hospital each day
					with a completely different disease, but with all the other
					features of a suspected case of SARS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the absence of asymptomatic transmission
					made control more feasible, SARS can be seen as an extremely
					dangerous disease, and (equally importantly) a
					disease capable of generating considerable anxiety among
					both health workers and the general population. Although
					less infectious than influenza, it seems to spread like some
					forms of the common cold (by coughing, perhaps direct
					contact with contaminated hands and materials, and perhaps
					even via sewage disposal systems). Some patients
					become highly infectious 'super-spreaders', accounting
					for many secondary cases. There is no particular
					behaviour or lifestyle choice that influences the risk of
					infection. SARS spreads very easily to those caring for
					patients, including doctors, nurses and other health workers.
					(This feature instantly guarantees it will be taken
					seriously.) The overall case fatality rate is high and, although
					the death rate is highest in the elderly, previously
					fit doctors and nurses were dead within a few days of the
					arrival of the disease in their wards.
				</p>
				<p>
					An unusual feature of the outbreak was the rapid spread
					of information. Once the SARS coronavirus had spread
					out of China, information about the disease spread even
					more rapidly than the disease itself, and public concern
					and public health measures began within days.
				</p>
				<p>
					SARS is neither the only new disease to emerge in the
					modern era nor the only one to spread among health
					workers. It does not have the highest level of infectiousness,
					or even the highest case fatality rate. But, unlike
					other worrisome diseases like Ebola, this is the first time
					since the First World War that a highly virulent and infectious
					disease with a brief incubation period has threatened
					to spread rapidly and widely into industrialised
					countries, and yet at the same time offered very feasible
					strategies for control.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Protection from disease versus protecting liberty</h4>
				<p>
					How in situations, such as that posed by SARS, is it possible
					to balance the interest of the public in being protected
					from disease with the interest of the public in preserving
					individual liberty? In essence, the criteria to be
					relied upon are no different from those for any other
					infectious disease. First, any response should be made on
					the basis of the best scientific evidence available on the
					extent of risk to health that the disease poses to others.
					The risk to others must be shown to be great and those
					suspected of being infected somehow recalcitrant in their
					behaviour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Involuntary quarantine of an individual may be seen as
					the equivalent of criminal detention. In many countries
					it is still the case that quarantine is ordered without any
					of the procedural safeguards usually demanded in criminal
					trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transparent processes should be adopted where individuals
					have the opportunity to challenge decisions made by
					authorities. This should diminish some of the resentment
					felt by those who feel they have been targeted inappropriately.
					This must go hand in hand with providing the
					most up-to-date information to the public about the disease
					and making the utmost efforts to discourage discrimination.
					In the most extreme cases, action may be taken
					and the opportunity for challenge (or perhaps compensation)
					provided subsequently.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation
					of Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil
					and Political Rights, (Annex, UN Doc E/CN.4/1985/4
					[1985]) form a helpful framework in considering whether
					and how people should be deprived of their liberty. They
					may be summarised as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The restriction is provided for and carried out in accordance
						with the law;
					</li>
					<li>
						The restriction is in the interest of a legitimate objective
						of general interest;
					</li>
					<li>
						The restriction is strictly necessary in a democratic
						society to achieve the objective;
					</li>
					<li>
						There are no less intrusive and restrictive means available
						to reach the same objective; and
					</li>
					<li>
						The restriction is not drafted or imposed arbitrarily,
						i.e. in an unreasonable or otherwise discriminatory
						manner <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="25 questions and answers on health and human rights. Geneva: WHO, July 2002, p18." id="9">(9)</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In the case of China, the power to quarantine was supported
					by law. Putting aside the question of penalties for
					breach of the law, it is unclear whether the law provides
					opportunity for challenge or redress. One might also question
					whether the restrictions imposed were the least intrusive
					or restrictive necessary. Within the framework
					offered by the Siracusa Principles, the imposition of the
					electronic tracking system adopted in Hong Kong might
					also be considered questionable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
				<p>
					When may confidentiality be breached and to whom?
					When might it ever be appropriate to provide a person's
					details to the public? During the SARS outbreak there
					have been many examples of the breaching of confidentiality
					between doctor and patient. It is difficult to see how
					much of such behaviour can be justified in ordinary circumstances.
					It is well-accepted that breaching confidentiality
					dissuades people from coming forward for medical
					assistance and from being frank in their discussions.
					This is particularly true when the person infected with
					the disease may also suffer discrimination should this
					knowledge become widely known.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a decision is taken that the risk to others is sufficient to
					merit a breach of confidentiality then consideration should
					be given to which people actually need to know the information.
					It will be very rare that information concerning a
					person infected with, or suspected of being infected with,
					a disease will need to be broadcast indiscriminately.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Forcing health professionals to treat patients</h4>
				<p>
					Particularly during the earliest part of the epidemic, when
					it was unclear what (if any) personal protective measures
					would be effective, health workers were called upon
					to put themselves at a very real (but unknown) degree of
					risk. Many had seen their colleagues die within days after
					relatively brief contact with SARS patients. It would
					be understandable if they wanted to flee rather than admit
					new patients. A public health perspective says they
					should stay at work; would it be acceptable for the hospital
					authorities to oblige individual health workers to stay
					at their posts? In similar situations in the past, with the
					emergence of a new disease with unknown characteristics,
					doctors and nurses have been asked to volunteer for
					the most dangerous tasks. Commonly these volunteers
					have been the single, childless, non-pregnant members
					of staff. Many, as in the SARS outbreak, have volunteered,
					to their credit. Others, perhaps influenced by the general
					trend towards a commercial model of medical services,
					have chosen to take the low-risk option. From a legal
					point of view many hospital staff would have signed contracts
					obliging them to perform their duties without any
					consideration of personal risk, but it is more likely that
					their decision to stay at work is motivated by the altruism
					the public and their peers expect from them.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					It turned out that SARS was not the 'Armageddon disease'
					that some infectious disease experts fear-a highly
					infectious disease with a high case fatality rate, short incubation
					period, no proven treatment, and a high proportion
					of transmission by asymptomatic individuals. It
					happens that it is not as highly infectious as originally feared, and the combination of gowns, gloves, masks and
					eye protection with careful handwashing is highly protective.
					However, it is definitely a serious concern; less
					infectious than influenza but with a case fatality rate similar
					to invasive meningococcal disease. Its sudden appearance
					in heavily populated and industrialised areas linked
					by rapid global air transport meant that, if it had been as
					bad as feared, it would have created a global disaster beyond
					the control of any health service in the world. This
					explains why such drastic measures were taken in several
					countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					SARS may well come back, or something even worse
					may appear. But even in the face of a completely new
					disease, there are precedents and guidelines for the kind
					of public health measures that are acceptable and likely
					to be helpful. Public health and civil authorities need act
					consistently with these principles so that human rights
					do not become an unnecessary casualty in the efforts to
					confront new disease threats.
