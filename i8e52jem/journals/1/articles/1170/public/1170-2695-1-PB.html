					The  ethical issues relating to confidentiality and partner notification, within the  context of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, are complex. The  individual's right to confidentiality can be in conflict with the partner's  right to be protected from medical risk. This paper describes some situations  faced by the staff of the Department of Community Health, Christian Medical  College, Vellore. It discusses ethical issues related to confidentiality and  partner notification, and documents problems relevant to India and to  comprehensive community health programmes with close links to the  community.

				<h4>The CHAD programme</h4>
				<p>
					The  primary health care programmes of CMC, Vellore, serve three administrative  blocks in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu and the population of Vellore town. The  Community Health and Development (CHAD) Programme serves one of these blocks,  Kaniyambadi, reaching a population of 106,010, a significant proportion of  which is from the lower socio-economic strata. The programme, run by the department  of community health (which has worked in Kaniyambadi Block for over 40 years)  is responsible for health care in the area in conjunction with governmental  agencies. The front line of CHAD's health care structure is the part-time  community health worker supported by a community health team which visits every  village fortnightly. Cases requiring greater medical input are referred to the  base hospital. CHAD has close links with the community, and it must be  responsive to the community's needs. The issues faced by the programme in  relation to HIV infection have to be seen in this context.

				<h4>Clinical situations</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Ms. A, a 30-year-old housewife, was admitted to  the hospital with a diagnosis of AIDS. Her husband, Mr. B, was also tested and  found to be positive for HIV. She died within a few weeks. Six months later,  Mr. B married his wife's sister, Ms. C, also from the area. Although the  community health staff knew the diagnosis they did not interfere, as it would  compromise Mr. B's confidentiality. Two years later, Ms. C came to the CHAD  hospital with a letter from another hospital stating that her husband, Mr. B,  was diagnosed to be in the terminal stage of AIDS. She also tested positive for  HIV.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Ms. K was referred to the high-risk antenatal  clinic as her first child had mental retardation with features suggestive of  congenital syphilis. Ms. K and her husband, Mr. L, tested positive for syphilis  and HIV infection. They were treated for syphilis and counselled regarding the  HIV infection. Ms. K delivered an apparently normal child. However, the child  developed severe septicaemia and died two weeks after birth. Ms. K was asked by  her husband to leave his home. Later she mentioned that her husband was  planning to marry a second time and provided the bride's address. She wanted  the hospital staff to help her prevent the marriage, as she knew the  implications of the disease.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Ms. P had a tubectomy at the hospital after a  normal home delivery. The neonate developed a swelling of the knee joint and  tested positive for syphilis. Ms. P and her husband (Mr. Q) were tested for HIV  infection and were found to be positive. Mr. Q admitted that he had another  sexual partner, Ms. R, a married woman. Ms. R also tested positive for HIV. Her  husband, Mr. S, was not aware of his wife's extra-marital relationship.  However, Ms. R refused to mention her HIV status to her husband, continued to  have sexual relationships with both partners and refused to use condoms. All  four were from the area and known to the community health staff. The hospital  staff found it difficult to take up the issue with Mr. S, as it would violate  the confidentiality agreement with Ms R.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Mr. X, a 22-year-old male, was admitted to the  hospital with septicaemia, tested and found positive for HIV. He was engaged to  be married.. He and his parents were counselled about the nature of the illness  and advised to postpone his marriage. Despite detailed discussion the family  was not keen to change their plans. The public health staff knew the girl and  advised her parents to inquire about the nature of Mr. X's illness before  proceeding with her marriage. The family approached Mr. X, asked about his  illness and went on to break the engagement.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Public  health staff have a responsibility not only to those with HIV but also to all  residents of the area they serve. In this context, the patient's right to  confidentiality (when they refuse to discuss the HIV status with their  partners) is in conflict with rights of their partners to protection from  medical risk.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
				<p>
					Confidentiality  as it relates to HIV continues to be a primary concern of individuals with the  disease, as well as to programmes and institutions that provide them with  services <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rennert S. AIDS/HIV and confidentiality: Model policy and procedures. Washington: American Bar Association, 1991." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Prevention of sexual transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. WHO AIDS series No. 6. Geneva: World Health Organization, 1990." id="2">2)</a>. Many programmes have a confidentiality policy specifically  relating to HIV, because of the potential consequences of unwarranted  disclosure. HIV infection has generated significant misinformation, fear and  prejudice, the foundations of discrimination. Efforts to maintain  confidentiality to prevent discrimination have formed the cornerstone of public  health strategy to control the spread of the disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respecting  a person's right to privacy &mdash; the right to decide who receives personal  information and how it may be used &mdash; requires that those with access to such  information maintain its confidentiality. Confidentiality, rooted in the right  to privacy, is a matter of personal autonomy. Since most public health  strategies for dealing with HIV are based on individuals coming forward  voluntarily for testing, counselling and treatment, failure to maintain  confidentiality could threaten the continued cooperation of people with HIV.  Many public health authorities have argued that the protection of the public's  health was not compromised by the protection of confidentiality. On the  contrary, the protection of confidentiality was a precondition for achieving  public health goals. Partner notification
				</p>
				<p>
					The  seriousness of the threat to the health of unsuspecting third parties resulted  in the debate on informing people at risk <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer R, Toomey KE. HIV prevention and the two faces of partner notification. American Journal of Public Health 1992; 82: 1158-1164." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fenton KA, Chippindale S, Cowan FM . Partner notification techniques. Dermatol Clin 1998;16:669-72." id="4">4)</a>, called 'partner notification'.  Two approaches to informing third parties have been debated: contact  tracing and the duty to warn.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Contact tracing</h4>
				<p>
					The  contact tracing approach emerged from sexually transmitted disease programmes <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer R, Toomey KE. HIV prevention and the two faces of partner notification. American Journal of Public Health 1992; 82: 1158-1164." id="3">(3)</a>. Based on the patient's voluntary cooperation in providing the names of  contacts, this never involved the disclosure of the identity of the index  patient (although these could be deduced in some cases) and entailed protecting  the absolute confidentiality of the entire notification process. The patient  maintained ultimate control over the process, and could provide or withhold  names of contacts. The fear of discrimination led to opposition to this  approach for HIV. The fact that no therapy was being offered (at the onset of  the epidemic) for HIV infection made it radically different from the role of  contact tracing in other STDs. The proponents of contact tracing argued that  attempting to change high-risk behavior was reason enough to pursue contact  tracing. Its opponents claimed that it was an intrusion of privacy without any  compensatory benefits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  record of programmes using contact tracing is variable. However, the current  emphasis is still on notification by the patient rather than the provider. With  the advent of treatment for HIV, the debate in the West on contact tracing has  shifted from privacy to efficacy of available treatment.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Duty to warn</h4>
				<p>
					The  second approach involved the moral 'duty to warn' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer R, Toomey KE. HIV prevention and the two faces of partner notification. American Journal of Public Health 1992; 82: 1158-1164." id="3">(3)</a>. This approach came out  of the clinical setting where the physician knew the identity of the person  deemed to be at risk. It argued for disclosure to endangered persons without  consent of the patient. It could also involve the revelation of the patient's  identity.
				</p>
				<p>
				The  <em>Tarasoff</em> ruling in the US in 1974 <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gutheil TG. Legal issues in Psychiatry. In Kaplan HI, Sadock BJ (eds) Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 6th Edition.. Baltimore: Williams & Wilkins, 1996:2747-2766." id="6">(6)</a> formed the basis of partner notification.  The ruling challenged the professional discretion of physicians faced with  patients who might endanger third parties. The court held that the  physician/therapist could be held liable for failing to take adequate steps to  protect a known intended victim of his/her patient, who in this case had  threatened to murder his former girlfriend. With <em>Tarasoff</em>, a matter of  professional discretion became a legal obligation. The basis of the decision  was the ethical judgment that although confidentiality was crucial for  individual patient autonomy, the protection of third parties vulnerable to  potential serious harm must be given priority. </p>
				<p>
					The  <em>Tarasoff</em> doctrine formed the context within which ethical issues related to the  breach of confidentiality were judged <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer R, Toomey KE. HIV prevention and the two faces of partner notification. American Journal of Public Health 1992; 82: 1158-1164." id="3">(3)</a>. The argument that the objective of  medical confidentiality is perverted if it is used to facilitate the  intentional transmission of the disease gained acceptance. It was deemed  ethically permissible for physicians to notify people whom they believed were  endangered. Many US states legislated that physicians were legally obliged to  notify subjects at risk of infecting third parties. However, civil liberty  groups opposed such disclosure by physicians without guidelines on which to  base the decision. The compromise between the opposing points of view was the  policy of the 'privilege to disclose'. For clinicians it offered the freedom to  make complex ethical judgments without the legal obligation. The criteria  suggested for disclosure were <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer R, Toomey KE. HIV prevention and the two faces of partner notification. American Journal of Public Health 1992; 82: 1158-1164." id="3">(3)</a> (i) the physician reasonably believes that  notification is medically appropriate and that there is a significant risk of  infection; (ii) the patient has been counselled regarding the need to notify  partners; (iii) the physician has reason to believe the patient will not notify  partners; and (iv) the patient has been informed of the physician's intent to  notify partners and has been given the opportunity to express a preference as  to whether the partners should be notified by the physician directly or by a  public health officer. Patient confidentiality continues to be a central issue,  even in those subjects in whom the 'duty to warn' tradition has been invoked.
				</p>
				<p>
					Persons  unknowingly placed at risk, from an ethical perspective of a clinical  relationship, have a moral right to information in order to protect themselves,  seek testing and commence treatment if necessary. Neither the principle of  confidentiality nor the value attached to professional autonomy is absolute.  Early identification of HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals has become  increasingly beneficial with the availability of antiviral therapy and  prophylactic antimicrobial agents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Issues  related to partner notification have been examined in detail <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="West GR, Stark KA. Partner notification for HIV prevention: a critical reexamination. AIDS Educ Prev 1997;9 (3 Suppl):68-78." id="7">(7)</a>. The  effectiveness of partner notification can be summarised as: (i) many, if not  most, HIV-infected individuals will cooperate in notifying at least some of  their sex partners of exposure to HIV; (ii) sex partners are generally  receptive to being notified and will seek HIV testing; (iii) patient referral  is probably not as effective as provider referral in reaching sex partners;  (iv) sex partners are often unaware of or misunderstand their HIV risks; and  (v) sex partners frequently have high rates of HIV infection. However, many  programmes have poor results at tracing contacts and notifying partners <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dye TD, Knox KL, Novick LF. Tracking sexual contacts of HIV patients: a study of physician practices.

				<h4>Issues in the developing world</h4>
				<p>
					Poverty  and illiteracy complicate issues related to HIV infection. The case for partner  notification becomes more important with the infection shifting to populations  with low awareness and limited capacity to act. The poor, the uneducated, and  the unemployed require special consideration and partner notification may be  especially important in these groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resource  limitations in developing countries makes partner notification difficult. The  labour-intensive nature of contact tracing makes it a expensive option. This  raises many policy questions. What proportion of the efforts at prevention  should be devoted to contact tracing? Should limited resources be focused  on educational and other efforts at limiting the spread of infection? Regional  variations prevent the formulation of a universal strategy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lack of  antiviral and other therapy available to individuals with HIV infection in the  developing world does not allow for treatment of people with infection. Contact  tracing will benefit uninfected partners, but the high cost of therapy is  beyond most infected and asymptomatic partners.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  National AIDS Control Organisation's guidelines for HIV counselling suggest  that there may be situations permitting partner notification, but they neither  discuss the issues nor offer specific criteria for disclosure <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National AIDS Control Organisation. HIV/AIDS/STD Counseling Training Manual. New Delhi: Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 1994." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Supreme Court of India has ruled on issue of the right to confidentiality of  subjects with HIV infection and the breach of confidentiality in order to  protect the health of third parties <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="AIR 1999 Supreme Court 495. S.Saghir Ahmed and B.N.Kripal, JJ. Civil Appeal No 4641 of 1998, D/-21.9.1998." id="12">(12)</a>. The court's opinion was that the  right to privacy and confidentiality is not absolute; it may be lawfully  restricted when third parties are at risk. The judgment went on to state that  persons with HIV infection who knowingly expose others to health risk are  guilty of an offense punishable under law. The Court ruling maintained that HIV  infected subjects did not have a right to marry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-governmental  organisations and human rights activists have pointed out that the law should  look at the larger issues <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Editorial. Rights of AIDS patients. The Hindu January 5, 2000." id="13">(13)</a>. They have argued that the right to marry is  constitutive of one's right to life and that this right cannot be qualified on  the basis of the health status of the person. Consequently, the denial of the  right to marry to those who may be HIV positive is morally unsustainable. The  Supreme Court ruling questions the legal status of marriages with HIV positive  persons even when based on the informed, free and willing consent of  partners. These issues have been raised in a Public Interest Litigation  now before the Court.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Issues for community health programmes</h4>
				<p>
					Clinicians  often do not know the patient's background and family relationships. They need  the patient's cooperation to obtain names of contacts. The situation is  different in comprehensive community health programmes closely linked to small  population groups with a detailed knowledge of the local people. The public  health staff are aware of the subject's usual contacts (e.g. spouse). They are  not only accountable to those with HIV infection but also to those partners who  may not have the virus. Holding back information which has a direct bearing on  the health of the partner is ethically indefensible. Maintaining  confidentiality may be useful in obtaining the continued cooperation of people  with HIV infection. However, the absence of partner notification within such  programmes can antagonise the general population. Such programmes will have to  tread a fine line in order to keep the interests of those with the infection  and their partners in mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					CHAD has  diagnosed and managed 43 subjects with HIV infection since the onset of the  epidemic. Its initial response was to maintain absolute confidentiality about a  person's HIV status. The focus was on a community education programme to  increase the awareness of HIV/AIDS, its mode of transmission and the methods of  protection. With the increase in the number of persons with HIV in the area there  was a realisation that the ethical issues were complex. The failure to warn  persons at risk, known to the public health staff of the programme, was also  ethically indefensible. It was also felt that not warning unsuspecting third  parties would jeopardise the programme's relationship with the general  population.
				</p>
				<p>
					CHAD has  since adopted the following guidelines for partner notification: (i) The  physician reasonably believes that notification is medically appropriate and  that there is a significant risk of infection; (ii) the patient has been  counselled regarding the need to notify partners; (iii) the physician has  reason to believe that the patient will not notify partners; (iv) the patient  has been informed of the physician's intent to notify partners, and (v) partner  notification will not involve the disclosure of the identity of the index  patient (although these may be deduced in some cases).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  programme has been notifying partners at risk for contacting the virus. Care is  taken to minimise the risk of discrimination of people with HIV infection. CHAD  runs a regular AIDS awareness programme for all the villages in the Block. AIDS  awareness is also part of the health education package at the monthly village  antenatal clinics. People with HIV and AIDS are not refused treatment because  of their infection either at the village clinics or at the base hospital. In  fact people with the infection who have medical and social problems have a fast  track access to medical and counselling staff. The health aide responsible for  the patient's village visits all HIV infected people in her jurisdiction and  their families at home every month. She provides education and psychological  support for patients and their families. On occasion senior counsellors or  senior doctors visit the patient's home to sort out issues, educate and provide  emotional support. Those with persistent and clinically significant distress  are seen by the staff of a family counselling centre. The programme also has a  mental health initiative.
				</p>
				<p>
					To date  all subjects with HIV infection/AIDS in the Block have continued to live with  their families at home. No serious problems have arisen either within the  family or with the local community. Frequent follow-up of people with HIV  infection by the programme staff, together with the policy of confidentiality  (information on a person's HIV status is shared with a limited number of staff  on a need to know basis), has helped prevent social isolation and  discrimination of patients and their families. Our initial experiences suggest  that the programme has been able to tread the fine line between the interests  of persons with HIV and those of their partners. The issue of marriage  among HIV positive adults or marriage after consent when one partner is infected  has not yet arisen in the local community.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					As  increasing numbers of persons with HIV infection come under the care of  clinicians and community programmes, the questions of breaching confidentiality  to warn unsuspecting partners will be faced repeatedly in medical practice.  Research and clinical experience suggest that many individuals who know that  they are infected fail to inform their sexual partners of the fact. Clinicians  will be increasingly called upon to notify partners. Policy makers will have to  decide whether this process of notification should be discretionary, as it is  currently, or be made mandatory. The moral claim of persons who have been  placed at risk entails the correlative moral duty of clinicians to ensure that  unsuspecting partners are informed. Comprehensive community health programmes  will have to develop policies for confidentiality and partner notification  related to HIV infection.
