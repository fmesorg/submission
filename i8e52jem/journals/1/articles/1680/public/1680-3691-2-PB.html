				<h4>A questionable medical  act:</h4>
				<p>
					A short while ago, interventions were carried out by doctors (presumably under  'orders' from 'higher authorities') on persons competent to make decisions  despite their protests. This raises the following issue: What does a medical  practitioner do when the dictates of 'employers'/' State' conflict with the  principles of medical ethics?
				</p>
				<p>
					Medha Patkar (a well-known leader in the <em>Narmada Bachao Andolan</em>) and Devram Kanera were on indefinite fasts in Bombay to protest against the  construction of the controversial dam. On the second day of their fasts, they  were arrested by the police and taken to St. George's Hospital. Despite their  protests intravenous fluids were infused into them by doctors at the hospital.  Patkar and Kanera were released two days later. Re-arrested nine days later,  they were taken to Bombay Hospital. Attempts to force feed them were made there  despite protests.

				<h4>Possible reasons for  lack of protest from the profession:</h4>
				<p>
					Whilst a few doctors in Bombay protested in letters to leading dailies against  such actions by their colleagues in these hospitals, the medical community at  large has remained silent. We wonder whether the following played a role in  ensuring this silence:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Some of us may be ignorant of the ethical requirement that We  must respect the autonomy of patients as regards choice of therapy especially  when they are competent to exercise such a choice.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some may feel that once a person is legally 'arrested', her/ his rights as a patient are restricted.
					</li>
					<li>
						Many might be unwilling to allow a person's health to  deteriorate when 'simple therapy' such as an infusion will restore fluid and  electrolyte balance.
					</li>
					<li>
						There may be a feeling that when superiors 'order' subordinates  to carry out actions that might contravene ethics, the onus shifts to the  superiors.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Why these reasons don't  hold:</h4>
				<p>
					Let us discuss some of these, taking the last argument first. In the Nuremberg  trials doctors violating ethics were penalized despite the fact that they were  'obeying State orders'.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Arrest' does not and can not suppress right to autonomy of  patients. Internationally recognized codes and declarations have been  formulated for our profession when dealing with those on hunger strikes. The  Tokyo declaration (1975) of the World Medical Association (WMA) stated: 'Where  a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the doctor as capable of  forming unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the consequences of such a  voluntary refusal of nourishment, he or she shall not be fed artificially... '
				</p>
				<p>
					Refusing nourishment (hunger fast) is recognised as a legitimate  form of democratic protest. Mahatma Gandhi used it in desperate situations with  remarkable efficacy. The issue on which such a protest is undertaken should not  influence the doctor's action. The patient's autonomy over her/his person must  be respected.
				</p>
				<p>
					No agency, including the police and judiciary can order a doctor  to act contrary to medical ethics.
				</p>

				<h4>An honourable way out  for a dissenting doctor:</h4>
				<p>
					The section of the Tokyo declaration refer to above was expanded in 1991 in  Malta in 'WMA Declaration on Hunger-Strikers'. The ethical conflict between  the doctor's moral obligation to save life and respect for the patient's  autonomy was considered. Whilst upholding the stand taken in Tokyo, it advised  those doctors who could not accept the patient's decision to refuse medically  administered nourishment to hand the patient over to another doctor.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Why, then, do we see  such unethical "obedience of orders"?</h4>
				<p>
					Ignorance of ethical norms is inexcusable on the part of the medical  practitioner. Medical colleges and the Medical Councils must be censured for  not putting forth clear guidelines
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the circumstances it is up to us to rectify the situation. Should one or more of our colleagues face action for refusing to obey patently  unjust and unethical orders, the rest of us must rally to their defence and  make the authorities realise that right must prevail.
				</p>
				<p>
					Failure to act will take us closer to tic horrors of domination by  the state and those in power exemplified by acts under the Third Reich. "Theirs  is not to question why; theirs is hut to do and die&rdquo; is now being challenged  even by armies. As members of a profession intended to show the utmost  compassion, we of all people, must not permit might to prevail over right.
