				<h4>Euthanasia: ethical risks</h4>
				<p>
					I have read the review of the film <em>Guzaarish</em> by Dr Natasha Anwar in <em>IJME</em>, January 2011. I have not seen the film but would like to put forward my views on the subject of euthanasia, taking off from the concluding sentence of the review.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a proponent of euthanasia and saw it being implemented in Australia, when I was in a Sydney hospital. However, its application, particularly in this sub-continent, is liable to be misused and, therefore, likely to have unwanted consequences. This is because most of our doctors, who would decide the merit of a case for euthanasia, are without integrity. In my opinion, almost every doctor (with some exceptions) issue false medical certificates for the availing of medical leave, even though the patient is fit. This can stretch to years of leave. Such doctors issue bogus medical certificates to persons involved in criminal acts to help them avoid going to jail, or attending court. How many court cases are adjourned on the basis of false medical certificates?!
				</p>
				<p>
					We have all heard of a number of cases regarding the inheritance of property, where our doctors could be manipulated at a price and authorise euthanasia, even to the extent of declaring that the patient has cancer. This loss of integrity and lack of clear medical ethics and conscience is a deficiency in our society. Until that is changed, introducing euthanasia is dangerous to the safety of many defenceless individuals.We can argue that all these cases should be monitored, but those involved in monitoring such cases will be the same Indians/ humans. And therefore we will need to have monitors to monitor the monitors.
