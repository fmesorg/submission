				<h4>No safety in nuclear medicine</h4>
				<p>
					The Atomic Energy  Regulatory Board inspected 28 of the 117 nuclear medicine units in India -- and  has noted safety violations in each of them. Chairperson Dr K S Parthasarthy  said the violations caused concern.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some transgressions  observed: workers did not use personal dose meters; they worked without gloves,  thus contaminating their hands; they smoked and ate within the facilities;  waste was disposed of in a cardboard box instead of the recommended  foot-operated waste bin; radiation-measuring equipment was faulty, as was the  process of isolating patients after treatment. The clear lack of a safety  culture and tendency to ignore precautions could lead to more serious  violations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The application of nuclear medicine in India is modest (160 nuclear medicine  physicians and 220 technologists) compared to the US (over 2,700 physicians and  14,000 technologists). But safety is should still be a high priority,  particularly with the doubling of units in the last two decades.

				<h4>Delayed  emergency care</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty-nine-year-old  Kaberi Roy died 24 hours after a 'successful' appendicitis operation. Her  parents have filed a criminal case blaming Dr B L Chitlangia and his associates  at Bombay Hospital for medical negligence. They hold that had their daughter  would have survived if she had been operated upon promptly. She was operated  upon 15 hours after her emergency admission.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Chitlangia admits  that the cause of death is not known but holds that the surgery was done  properly. He denies a delay in surgery, saying the wait was for appropriate  medical reasons.

				<h4>The doctors of tomorrow</h4>
				<p>
					A first-year MBBS  student at Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College in Raipur was stripped and made to  run naked through the college complex for wearing coloured trousers, a  violation of the dress code for junior students. Following a complaint by the  student's father, Raipur police arrested two of the accused students. A third  is absconding. All three have been expelled from the college hostel (but not,  apparently, the college). The director of medical education, Dr R C Bhola,  says, "I have asked the dean of the medical college to submit a detailed  report. We will take appropriate action."

				<h4>Regulating medical devices</h4>
				<p>
					A special body is needed  to regulate the use of medical devices such as those for laser surgery, said Dr  RB Vajpayee, professor of ophthalmology at AIIMS. In the absence of such a  system, such devices may be misused. Dr Vajpayee conducted a study which concluded  that the use of the lasik laser for correcting eye defects, may be  inappropriate for many Indians because they have smaller corneas on an average.  This can result in complications if adequate screening precautions are not  taken.

				<h4>Regulating infertility treatment</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of  Medical Research has unveiled draft guidelines to regulate infertility  treatment in India, prompted by concerns about unethical practices in  infertility clinics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The guidelines specify  infrastructure requirements and a code of practice for infertility clinics, as  well as additional training for gynaecologists who specialise in the treatment  of infertility through assisted reproductive technology. The council has also  proposed the creation of a government agency to license infertility clinics and  ensure that they adhere to standards. The agency would also have the power to  fix the upper limit of charges for gamete donation and surrogacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The council's draft  guidelines will be debated over the next three months, after which a final version  will be sent to the government for legislation.

				<h4>Boys will be boys</h4>
				<p>
					Over 100 students from  the B Block hostel of BJ Medical college in Ahmedabad representing the North  Gujarat lobby and traditional fiefdom of former MCI president Ketan Desai broke  into the rival A block armed with steel pipes, tubelights and other weapons.  They were celebrating reports that Dr Desai was to be exonerated of corruption  charges. They injured at least 10 students in the attack, two critically.
				</p>
				<p>
					The injured doctors  chose to be treated in a private hospital rather than the Civil hospital where  they did not feel safe. Eye witnesses said the perpetrators included Deepak  Limbachiya, now an assistant professor.

				<h4>Free samples</h4>
				<p>
					A British and German  genetic study that analysed material from people in Kerala has renewed a debate  on the need to regulate the flow of human biological material from India.  The study analysed DNA from saliva of 988 healthy people from a coastal region  in Kerala with the world's highest levels of natural radiation. Indian  scientists ask how the researchers took samples out of the country without  approval, reiterating concerns that India's diverse population might serve as a  source of valuable genetic information with potential commercial value.  Guidelines introduced in the late 1990s permit export of biological material  for research only with approval from the health ministry.
				</p>
				<p>
					The UK researcher, Dr  Peter Forster, said informed consent was obtained from the volunteers and the  university's ethics committee had approved the study. He added that the study  had no commercial application.

				<h4>Trial subjects or guinea pigs?</h4>
				<p>
					As foreign  pharmaceutical companies target India for 'cheaper and faster' clinical trials,  how are research subjects protected from harm during such trials? There are  many mechanisms - but most of them don't do what they are supposed to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of  Medical Research guidelines are not necessarily enforced. Once a research  project gets ethical approval, there is no authority to monitor the research to  ensure that it is carried out ethically.
				</p>
				<p>
					EC members are often  handpicked by those who have an interest in the trial, says Dr Sanjay Nagral,  member of the Forum for Medical Ethics Society in Mumbai.
				</p>
				<p>
					Companies pay  volunteers; a drug company recently paid Rs 2,000 to volunteers for an  anti-rabies vaccine trial at the Haffkine institute, notes Dr SM Sapatnekar,  director of the Haffkine Insitute. Such amounts will surely influence the  'informed consent' of poor and amount to inducement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Drug companies also  'donate' research equipment to institutions conducting trials - which is bound to  colour the result of research.

				<h4>Premarital HIV mandatory</h4>
				<p>
					Even as the Maharashtra  government ruled out mandatory HIV tests before marriage, village elders of  Hivare Bazar near Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, have decreed that any outsider  planning to marry someone from their village will have to be tested for HIV  beforehand. If the gram sabha approves this proposal, it will be enforced from  next April.
				</p>
				<p>
					State health minister  Digvijay Khanwilkar recently stated that mandatory tests would add to the  social and ethical problems associated with the disease, and a law to this  effect would be in violation of NACO guidelines.

				<h4>Public gives up on the medical council</h4>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra Medical  Council has never been more efficient than over the last three years after it  was taken over by a court administrator following allegations of bogus voting.  The backlog of csses is being tackled, hearings are held and judgements handed  out. But the number of complaints has dropped sharply, says Dr S M Sapatnekar,  the court-appointed administrator. The widespread perception that the medical  profession is unethical should have led to an increase in complaints, but the  MMC's reputation is such that the public no longer considers it the appropriate  forum for redressing grievances against doctors.

				<h4>Professional colleges must charge fees to all</h4>
				<p>
					An eleven member  Constitutional bench of the Supreme Court ruled that there will be no more  'free' or 'payment' seats in medical, engineering and other professional  colleges in the country. Fees will be uniform for all students in any  particular college, though they may differ from area to area depending on the  costs incurred by the college.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bench held as  unconstitutional the scheme framed by a two-judge bench in 1992 fixing 'free',  'payment' and 'management quota' seats while admitting students in professional  educational institutions. That scheme was framed to check capitation fees. The  bench held to "the principle that there should not be capitation  fees".

				<h4>Medical tourism, brain drain</h4>
				<p>
					With an estimated  shortfall of 20,000 nurses in the UK and US, Indian health care majors have  jumped into the fray with services to train and place Indian nurses in  hospitals abroad. Already, reputed hospitals lose 20-25 per cent of their  nurses to hospitals abroad, usually in the Gulf. This will soon include the UK  and US, said Dr Arti Verma of Max Health Care.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same time,  medical tourism is predicted to double in the next few years as health services  in India are a fraction of what they cost in the West. Apollo hospital gets  10-11 foreign patients every month. Five to seven per cent of Escorts' patients  are from abroad. Though most of the traffic is from West Asia, south-east Asia  and Africa, "We are talking to international health insurance companies so  our hospitals are recognised and Non Resident Indians can combine their  treatment here with family visits," says Dr Yogi Mehrotra of Indraprastha  Apollo hospital.

				<h4>Will a code result in responsible advertising?</h4>
				<p>
					The Organisation of  Pharmaceutical Producers of India has unveiled the code of ethics for  advertisement of drugs. The object of the code is to ensure responsible  advertising in promoting medicines which may be purchased by the public without  any prescription and for which therapeutic claims are made.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his address on  understanding the Indian consumer the managing director of Morepen Ltd  emphasised the role of the housewife in household drug purchases. He described  the company's concept of a housewife's 'pitara' which consists of a number of  OTC drugs and also some ethical drugs stored for self-mediation. The latter  have generally been bought after the first prescription has been made by  the family physician. The executive director (consumer pharmaceuticals)  of Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA, said the Asia-Pacific OTC market was valued at $  15.1 billion in 2001. The varying sizes of OTC markets in different countries  were determined by purchasing power, awareness, definition of OTC, competition,  government regulation and cultural differences. "Self medication is  accepted as part of treatment options in health care in this part of the  world."

					years. A member of the gang arrested for this racket is
					reported to have confessed that he cremated 15 bodies under
					fake names and addresses. The authorisation committee for
					kidney donation was found to have authorised transplants
					on the basis of false affidavits. Arrest warrants have been
					issued for an advocate who was allegedly instrumental in
					preparing fake affidavits for Rs 10,000 each.

				<h4>Elections IMA style?</h4>
				<p>
					The president elect of  the Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, Dr Dilip Guha, has ordered an  inquiry into allegations of bogus voting during its annual conference in  Sangli. Two voters, who were registered as doctors from Mumbai, stated under  interrogation that they were not doctors but had come to vote for Dr Vasant  Shenoy, general secretary of the Mumbai suburban west branch. Dr Shenoy said he  had nothing to do with the two men. After this incident came to light Dr Guha  received other similar complaints. Sources said many doctors aspired to become  office-bearers of the IMA because of the money associated with pharmaceutical  firms that sponsor events. The IMA has a membership of 1.5 lakh doctors in  India.

				<h4>Public services do better</h4>
				<p>
					A survey of patient  satisfaction at the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, the city's largest  public hospital, found that not only were the majority of patients satisfied  with its services, they also rated the hospital better than private clinics they  had attended before admission to KEM.
				</p>
				<p>
					Seventy per cent felt  doctors gave good treatment though they did not communicate enough and other  staff were unhelpful. Many felt post-operative care was poor. The food was okay  but bed linen was inadequate and the toilets dirty. People had to wait  for tests and treatment, and were not informed of delays. Even subsidised  services were too expensive. Over 90 per cent were unaware that a grievance  cell existed in the hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Arun Bal of ACASH  says the survey demonstrates the need for public hospitals. Dr N  Kshirsagar, dean of KEM hospital, said the survey has led to some changes but  much of the problem lies in money shortages. The hospital needs Rs 9 crore  annually but gets only Rs 3 crore.

				<h4>The IMA and the kidney  trade</h4>
				<p>
					A close look by <em>The Hindu</em> at an inquiry report by the Indian Medical  Association, Kerala branch, seems to have dug up a can of worms. The reports  appeared between October 25, 2002, and December 2, 2002.
				</p>
				<p>
					The IMA inquiry into the  kidney transplant racket in the state concluded that money did change hands  between kidney donor and recipient - but that doctors and hospitals knew  nothing about it. Apparently the doctors were earnest but innocent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report documented  irregularities in various hospitals but pardoned them. It referred to a person  who complained that he was coerced into handing over his kidney but did not  investigate it further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Investigations revealed  that the IMA's report findings were diluted before being made public. This was  done to let guilty doctors and hospitals go scot free.
				</p>
				<p>
					The original report  included a complaint that a kidney was extracted from a pregnant woman with a  six-month-old child. She underwent an abortion and five days later she was  certified fit for surgery by a gynaecologist, AM Indira. Her kidney was removed  one month later. The original report also noted that at some hospitals, money  for the kidney sale would be kept at the hospital cash counter for safe  custody.
				</p>
				<p>
					Senior doctors in Kerala  issued a statement condemning the IMA for its refusal to hold the medical  profession accountable for its involvement in the kidney trade. The People's  Health Movement, a people-oriented global initiative, expressed concern over  the illegal trading of kidneys in Kerala and the effort of the professional  body of doctors to protect the culprits. <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/" target="_blank">www.hinduonnet.com</a>

				<h4>HIV: blood donors to be informed</h4>
				<p>
					India's health ministry  announced that blood donors found to be HIV positive would be told of their  infection and asked to seek confirmatory tests and counselling. This will end  the existing policy in which blood infected with HIV is discarded without  repeating the test and without informing the donor. India's blood banks have  been screening blood for HIV since the early 1990s, but health officials say  donors could not be informed because of a lack of infrastructure for  counselling.
				</p>
				<p>
					The health ministry has  announced a plan that seeks to introduce an accreditation scheme for blood  banks to achieve required quality standards by March 2003.
