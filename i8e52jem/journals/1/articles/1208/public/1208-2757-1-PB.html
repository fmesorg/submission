					This issue of the journal deals with an important  aspect of health service provision: general practice. The contributors belong  to the small minority in the medical community who are committed to ethical  practice and are alarmed by current trends. They have grappled with some of the  current controversies in general practice. They have identified issues which  cause much discomfort within the medical community. They have analysed the  history of these tensions, but they have come up with few solutions. This is  because there are no simple solutions.

				<h4>General practice in the past</h4>
				<p>
					Ancient India did not have a formal public health  system. The ruling classes had access to royal vaids. The rest depended on  local health traditions based on household remedies. The foundations of modern  medicine in India were laid down by the British Raj more than 150 years ago.  The colonial health service commenced with the setting up of public medical  colleges and hospitals. Eventually this led to the dominance of a  hospital-oriented, urban-centred, health service, contrary to the needs of the  public. This bias continues today. By the end of the first world war, the  various medical colleges set up by the British Government were well  established, aided by the arrival of antibiotics and investigating modalities  like X-rays. Graduates in modern medicine started settling down in practice.  The early 1930s heralded the development of what is known as general practice,  in metropolises like Mumbai. General practitioners (GPs) played a key role in  providing the poor urban population with treatment for minor colds and coughs  as well as serious infections and other ailments. GPs came from a middle-class  background with proper qualifications to practice. They were known for being  hard working, and for their compassion for patients. They were not perceived as  greedy; on the contrary, they were often an integral part of their patients'  families. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then.

				<h4>Medical practice today</h4>
				<p>
					Today, medicine has more than 50 medical  specialities. Medical practice has become increasingly dependent on modern  technology, hospital-oriented and dehumanised. The mushrooming of  capitation-fee medical colleges has given rise to a generation of half-baked  doctors. At the same time untrained, inexperienced, unregistered and  unqualified practitioners are practising modern medicine without fear of being  caught and punished.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for patients, today they tend to either  self-medicate or to approach a specialist directly, for even minor ailments.  There is also a change in the disease pattern, as lifestyle and metabolic  diseases become more common; such ailments will soon pose a bigger problem than  infectious diseases do, to the health services. Finally, the breakdown of  family and human relations has also affected the doctor-patient relationship.

				<h4>Unethical practices</h4>
				<p>
					Improving the ethics of medical practice is a  favourite topic of discussion both among doctors and lay people. One of the  articles in this issue deals in detail with 'cut practice', a 'custom' started  by insecure consultants about 50 years ago, which has spread like wild fire. In  today's society, to expect an individual doctor to be moral is like asking for  the moon. We must not forget that the majority of patients are happy to offer  'fees' for false bills and certificates. Even the Mahatma failed in his  experiment. Changing the situation will be a Herculean task involving a  sustained effort by GPs and consultants with their respective associations. In  fact, it should be a lifetime mission of all well-meaning people, including  consumer organisations.

				<h4>The importance of general  practice</h4>
				<p>
					Ironically, the increase in specialisation, and the  attendant skyrocketing of health care costs, makes the GP more important today  than ever before. In the west, national health schemes recognise the importance  of the GP as a gatekeeper. In these countries, a patient cannot approach a  specialist directly. Modern medical practice must be GP-based if national  expenditure on health is to be brought under control. It is unfortunate that  general practice is seen as having little social relevance in the 21st century.  The General Practitioners Association of Greater Mumbai tries its best to  imbibe confidence and self respect in GPs by arranging CME programmes. It also  tried to negotiate a formal programme to keep GPs involved in the management of  their hospitalised patients; they were to be paid for their services officially.  However, this plan did not materialise.

				<h4>The ideal GP</h4>
				<p>
					The ideal GP should have proper qualifications and  good experience. The patient has a right to ask for the GP's registration  certificate. GPs should continue to learn and update their knowledge by  attending CME programmes. GPs should be very good at listening and  communication skills. They should be ready to discuss the patient's medical  problems in an open manner. They should be available to their patients for  emergencies. They should be caring in nature. Their charges should be  reasonable. On their part, patients also should have faith in their GPs. They  should not expect false bills and certificates from them. If GPs are prepared  to play the role of a teacher and counsellor, and to do their bit for  preventive medicine, they will do immeasurable good service to society.
