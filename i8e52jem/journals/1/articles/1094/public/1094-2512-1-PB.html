					<strong>Robin Shohet (ed). <em>Passionate medicine: making the transition
					from conventional medicine to homeopathy.</em> London, Jessica
					Kingsley Publishers, 2005. pp 192, &pound;9.95/$28.95, ISBN 1
					84310 298 6.</strong> Reviewed by Houghton A in <em><strong>BMJ</strong></em> 2005; 331:1276
				</p>
				<p>
					The contributors are five doctors and two vets who struggled
					with the practice of conventional medicine and found a more
					natural home in homoeopathy. The seven clinicians tell their
					stories and "are remarkable in not having been prepared to make
					the compromises that modern medicine required of them. Most
					of their stories have a strong spiritual theme."

					<strong>Kurt Link. <em>The vaccine controversy: the history, use, and safety

				</p>
				<p>
					The book provides a summary of the history of vaccines along
					with some basic information on features of vaccines. The
					reviewer, head of the vaccine-preventable disease programme
					in Wales, states that while the book covers some interesting
					historic details about vaccination, it has omitted key historical
					information and current debates.

					Colgrove in <em><strong>N Eng J Med</strong></em> 2005; 353:2824
				</p>
				<p>
					The author posits that the variations among western nations
					in formulating public health policy related to the threat of the
					AIDS epidemic "were influenced by precedents dating, in many
					instances, to encounters with disease in the 19th century."

					Maas in <em><strong>N Eng J Med</strong></em> 2006; 354: 1654.
				</p>
				<p>
					The contributors from 12 countries, rich and poor, describe the
					ways in which people make choices about end-of-life issues.
					Culture, religion and social structure, rather than modern
					medicine, are the major determining factors.

				</p>
				<p>
					The editor asked eminent physicians to describe how the
					knowledge of medical history had influenced their medical
					practice. Their autobiographical essays enumerate how a
					historical perspective adds depth to the understanding of
					diseases and treatments.

					<strong>James F Childress, Eric M Meslin and Harold Shapiro (eds). <em>Belmont revisited: ethical principles for research with human

				</p>
				<p>
					The Belmont Report, released in 1979, was a seminal publication
					in research ethics emphasising patient autonomy, beneficence/
					non-malfeasence and justice. The authors of the original report
					and other scholars describe the report's historical origins and
					influence on public policy. The reviewer feels that the book falls
					short because it fails to address more recent concerns such as
					conflict of interest and social and behavioural research.

					and DU Himmelstein in <em>N Eng J Med</em> 2006; 354:1328-1329.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors focus on the relationship between social inequality
					and ill health. They link violence, occupational hazards, poverty
					and poor sanitation to medical diseases and point to ways of
					correcting this injustice through advocacy, education and
					research.

					Eng J Med</em> 2006; 354:1329.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The author links psychosocial factors such as low social status
					and negative experiences in early childhood with biologic stress
					reactions. The reviewer notes: "He believes that the political
					action necessary for improving the quality of life will come only
					after the public understands these issues better."

					<strong>W Grant Thompson. <em>The placebo effect and health: combining

					HL Fields in <em>N Eng J Med</em> 2006; 354:984-985.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The book discusses how modern medicine has intruded on
					the doctor-patient relationship, which is the core of medical
					practice. The first part of the book gives an excellent description
					of the placebo effect but lacks details of recent research. In the
					second part the author describes factors such as the placebo
					effect that enhance or diminish a patient's response.

					<strong>Kathryn Montgomery. <em>How doctors think: clinical judgment

				</p>
				<p>
					Medicine is not a science like chemistry or physics, with
					absolute rules. It is a practice where the biological variability
					of disease, humans and social conditions makes absolute
					rules impossible. Instead of rules, doctors rely on clinical
					judgement, which is a mixture of science, experience and
					gut feeling. Although unscientific, this helps them treat
					patients.
