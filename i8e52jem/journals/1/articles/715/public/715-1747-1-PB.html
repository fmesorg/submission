				<h4>An epidemiological review of the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera. C Sathyamala. Medico Friend Circle, Forum For Woman's Health, Mumbai, 2000. pp. 160, Rs 100.</h4>
				<p>
					Long-acting injectable hormonal contraceptives have been
					the subject of much controversy. Health activists have opposed
					them while most doctors and officials have supported them.
					The arguments made in this book by a feminist epidemiologist
					and health advocate are based on a critical review of about 200
					scientific papers and monographs on Depo-Provera, or Depot
					Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (DMPA).
				</p>
				<p>
					DMPA has been touted as a highly effective contraceptive. But
					the book points out that in field conditions, its use-effectiveness
					in low. In one study,40% of women got their first injection at the
					wrong time of their menstrual cycle. Almost 30% discontinued
					injectable contraceptives within a year.
				</p>
				<p>
					DMPA causes significant menstrual disturbances. The pro-DMPA
					lobby tends to belittle the problem. The book points out that
					menstrual disturbances are not a minor issue for women and
					they are often the reason for discontinuation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some commentators discount the significance of heavy
					bleeding, arguing that haemoglobin levels are not lower
					amongst DMPA users. Sathyamala notes that long-acting
					injectable contraceptives lead to a fall in serum ferritin levels
					even without lower haemoglobin levels, and are responsible for
					some symptoms of anaemia such as fatigue.
				</p>
				<p>
					DMPA causes amenorrhoea - for 55% of women within a year
					of use. DMPA protagonists consider this a beneficial side-effect,
					improving women's haemoglobin levels. However, the author
					notes that haemoglobin levels are not higher amongst DMPA
					users. Second, most Indian women find amenorrhoea in the
					absence of pregnancy unacceptable. Third, such amenorrhoea
					is due to ovarian and endometrial atrophy which may be
					irreversible. Overall, menstrual disturbances are significant both
					subjectively and medically.
				</p>
				<p>
					A survey found women complaining of a decrease in libido,
					vaginal dryness, night sweats, hot flushes following the use
					of DMPA. loss of libido for women is considered a minor sideeffect
					by the health care system -even as it discounts DMPA as
					a male contraceptive because it reduces libido in men.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book quotes a number of studies, some of which clearly
					show that DMPA induces osteoporosis. A substantial proportion of Indian women already suffer from calcium deficiency.
				</p>
				<p>
					A key controversy has centred around DMPA and the risk of
					breast cancer. Findings of toxicological studies were the basis
					of the US Public Board of Inquiry decision, in 1984, that DMPA
					should not be approved for contraceptive use there. However,
					in 1991, a WHO multinational case-control study on the risk
					of breast, cervical, endometrial and liver cancers due to DMPA
					concluded that it did not enhance the overall risk of malignancy.
					The US FDA approved DMPA as a contraceptive, followed by the
					Drugs Controller General of India. The author challenges the
					study's design and conduct, and therefore the scientific validity
					of its conclusions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author quotes studies that DMPA increases the risk of
					mutagenicity and teratogenicity by five to 10 times. It may be
					argued that birth defects occur only after failure of contraception
					and are therefore a remote possibility. First, such a high relative
					risk for birth defects is unacceptable. Second, the drug and its
					metabolites circulate in the blood for up to 200 days. Women
					who discontinue DMPA may become pregnant within six months,
					exposing their foetuses to DMPA. Under field conditions, women
					may get DMPA even when pregnant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the author's points may be less conclusive. There is
					limited evidence of the drug's effect on breast-feeding infants.
					And while DMPA delays return of fertility after discontinuation
					there is no evidence of irreversible infertility.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, overall the book presents a solid epidemiological
					critique of DMPA as a contraceptive. It demonstrates that leading
					gynaecologists are off the mark in their assessment of safety of
					DMPA. Worse, they favoured DMPA despite formidable evidence
					against it. WHO and US FDA approval is presumably under the
					pressure of the population control lobby.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book was researched and written without funding. The
					printing was supported by donations from well wishers, and
					members of the two publishing organisations. Overall, this is
					a product of the author's and a small group's determination to
					expose the irrationality of DMPA as a contraceptive. It is a must
					for anybody interested in women's health issues.
