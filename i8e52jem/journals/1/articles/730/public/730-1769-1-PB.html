  <p>Conducting psychiatric studies from the perspective of the
    humanities and the social sciences is a new endeavour in the
    Indian context. For this reason the ethical quandaries that
    may be faced in this area are seldom discussed. A few medical
    institutions working in the mental health sector have some type
    of mandatory ethical screening. However, such instances are
    rare. In the absence of organised ethical forums, or sustained
    discussion on ethics, the mental health professions have
    no platform where such dilemmas can be tabled. (Among
    the mental health professions, I include psychiatry, clinical
    psychology, psychiatric and medical social work and the
    related social sciences.) The present case study <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Addlakha Renu. Ethical quandaries in anthropological fieldwork in psychiatric settings. IJME 2005; 2: 55-56." id="1">(1)</a> is therefore
    an important contribution to the ethics of working with
    persons with psychosocial disabilities. Such disclosures should
    encourage the mental health community to bring the topic of
    psychiatric ethics into the public domain.</p>
  <p>The issue of confidentiality has been robustly dealt with by the
    researcher (RA), especially the negotiations between family /
    relative / carer and the user of psychiatric services.</p>
  <p>The researcher is also keenly aware of the scope for coercion
    when inducting users of psychiatric services into the study.
    She has employed the strategy of explicitly stating that being
    involved in the study is not in any way linked with receiving
    continuing care and treatment. Institutional consent was not
    taken as individual consent. It is also commendable that the
    researcher did not accept proxy consent by a carer. Recently, the
    NGO SAARTHAK filed an intervention before the Supreme Court
    arguing for the omission of Section 8.1 of the Mental Health
    Act, 1987, which liberally allows proxy consent in research on
    persons with psychosocial disabilities. The intervention argues
    that no research should be conducted without user consent.</p>
            </div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Research and care</h4>
  <p>In such studies, researchers are often confronted with the issue
    of providing care for participants. When the researcher and the
    service provider are from the same institution, there is a conflict
    between the researcher's interest in inducting participants
    into the study, and the provider's interest in providing care to
    a needy person. The issue crops up in different ways for both
  social science and biomedical research.</p>
  <p>This question did not arise for RA, as service provision was left
    to the hospital where she conducted the study. However, there
    is the related question, of the research's relevance to the user.
    The Mental Health Act mandates that any such research should
    be of 'direct' benefit to the user. The act does not define 'direct'
    benefit, leaving it to interpretation. RA's study does not address
    the question of risks and benefits, what the direct benefits were
  to the user, and whether they were considered or negotiated.</p>
  <p>The case study does not talk about the time spent with the
    participant, which can be an important issue especially when
  people visit an institution in a state of acute emotional distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Definitions of competence</h4>
  <p>There appears to be some vagueness in RA's position on
    competence. This can be seen as a general dilemma in the
    mental health research field. On the one hand, she has accepted,
    as fully competent, persons who have refused to participate even
    though the family has given consent. On the other hand, she has
    taken into account the medical opinion (&quot;joint consultation&quot;) of
    incompetence and has chosen not to take persons (who may
  have consented if she had asked).</p>
  <p>In India, professional bodies such as the Indian Psychiatric Society
    have not established standards for the medical assessment of
    incompetence. In the absence of tools to decide incompetence,
    a medical finding of mental illness is offered as a legal finding
    of incompetence. (For example, a person is held unfit for trial
    because he is suffering from schizophrenia.) Legal case work in
    India gives much evidence of such examples in the mental health
    field <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dhanda Amita Legal order / mental disorder: draft of the working group on the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. New Delhi: Sage Publications; 2001" id="2">(2)</a>. Also, the present discussion on the UN Convention on
    the Rights of Persons with Disabilities grants full legal capacity
    to all persons with any type of disability. In this situation, it is not
    clear how far a medical opinion of incompetence can override
    a user opinion of competency, or a human rights consideration
  of full capacity.</p>
