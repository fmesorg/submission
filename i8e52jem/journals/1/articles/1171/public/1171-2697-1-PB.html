					Joseph  Lazaroff's cancer had spread throughout his body. Eight months earlier, he had  seen his doctor about a backache. A scan revealed tumours in Lazaroff's liver,  bowel, and up and down his spine. A biopsy showed an untreatable cancer.  Lazaroff went on around-the-clock morphine to control his pain.  his  legs had become weak and he became incontinent. A scan showed a metastasis  compressing his thoracic spinal cord. Radiation had no effect. Spinal surgery  offered a last-ditch chance of restoring some strength to his legs and  sphincters. The risks, however, were severe and his chance of surviving the  procedure and getting back home was slim. The alternative was to do nothing.  He'd go home with hospice care, which would keep him comfortable and help him  maintain a measure of control over his life. It was his best chance of dying  peacefully surrounded by his loved ones. The decision was Lazaroff's.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only a  decade ago, doctors made the decisions; patients did what they were told.  People were put on machines, given drugs, and subjected to operations they  would not have chosen. And they missed out on treatments that they might have  preferred. Then in 1984 a book, The Silent World of Doctor and Patient,  by a Yale doctor and ethicist named Jay Katz, dealt a devastating critique of  traditional medical decision-making. Katz argued that medical decisions could  and should be made by the patients involved. By the early '90s, we were taught  to see patients as autonomous decision-makers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  practice, patients make bad decisions too. But when you see your patients  making a grave mistake, should you simply do what the patients' want? The  current medical orthodoxy says yes. After all, whose body is it, anyway?
				</p>
				<p>
					Lazaroff  wanted surgery. The oncologist was dubious about the choice, but she called in  a neurosurgeon who warned them about the risks. But Lazaroff wasn't to be  dissuaded. Outside the room, David, his son, told me that his mother had spent  a long time in intensive care on a ventilator before dying of emphysema, and  since then his father had often said that he did not want anything like that to  happen to him. But now he was adamant about doing 'everything'. Lazaroff had  his surgery the next day. The operation was a technical success. Lazaroff's  lungs wouldn't recover however, and we struggled to get him off the ventilator.  It became apparent that our efforts were futile. It was exactly the way  Lazaroff hadn't wanted to die - strapped down and sedated, tubes in every  natural orifice and in several new ones, and on a ventilator.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lazaroff  chose badly because his choice ran against his deepest interests as he  conceived them. It was clear that he wanted to live. He would take any risk -  even death - to live. But life was not what we had to offer. We could offer  only a chance of preserving minimal lower-body function at cost of severe  violence to him and extreme odds of a miserable death. But he did not hear us.  Couldn't it have been a mistake, then, even to have told him about the surgical  option? We are exquisitely attuned to the requirements of patient autonomy. But  there are still times when a doctor has to steer patients to do what's right  for themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a  controversial suggestion. People are rightly suspicious of those claiming to  know better than they do what's best for them. But a good physician cannot  simply stand aside when patients make bad or self-defeating decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Suppose  you are a doctor seeing a female patient in her 40s. She had a mammogram before  seeing you, and now you review the radiologist's report, which reads,  "There is a faint group of punctate clustered calcifications. Biopsy may  be considered to exclude the possibility of malignancy." You suggest a  biopsy. Three times in the past five years, her annual mammogram has revealed  an area of suspicious calcifications. Three times a surgeon has taken her to  the operating room and removed the tissue in question. And three times under  the pathologist's microscope, it has proved to be benign. "I'm not getting  another goddam biopsy," she says, and she stands up to get dressed. Do you  let her go? It's not an unreasonable thing to do. She's an adult, after all.  Still, these calcifications are not equivocal findings. They often do indicate  cancer. Now people have to be permitted to make their own mistakes. But when  the stakes are high, and the bad choice may be irreversible, doctors are  reluctant to sit back. You could tell her she's making a big mistake. And in  all likelihood you'll lose her. The aim isn't to show her how wrong she is. The  aim is to win her over. Notice what good doctors do. They sit her down. And  when you sit close by, on the same level as your patients, you're no longer the  rushed, bossy doctor with no time for them; patients feel less imposed upon and  more inclined to think you are both on the same side of the issue. Oddly  enough, nine times out of ten this approach works. People feel as if they've  been heard, and have had an opportunity to vent. At this point, they finally  begin to ask questions, voice doubts, even work through the logic themselves.  And they come around.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it is  misleading to view all this simply as the art of doctorly manipulation: when  you see patients cede authority to the doctor, something else may be going on.  The new orthodoxy about patient autonomy has a hard time acknowledging an  awkward truth: patients frequently don't want the freedom that we have given  them. That is, they are glad to have their autonomy respected, but the exercise  of that autonomy means being able to relinquish it. It turns out that patients  commonly prefer to have others make their medical decisions. One study found  that although sixty-four percent of the general public thought they'd want to  select their own treatment if they develop cancer, only 12 percent of newly  diagnosed cancer patients actually did want to do so. Carl Schneider, a  professor of law and medicine at the University of Michigan, recently published  a book called <em>The Practice of Autonomy</em> in which he sorted through a welter of  studies on medical decision-making. He found that ill patients were often in a  poor position to make good choices. Schneider found that physicians, being less  emotionally engaged, are able to reason through the uncertainties without the  distortions of fear and attachment. They work in a scientific culture that  disciplines the way they make decisions. They have the benefit of 'group  rationality' - norms based on scholarly literature and refined practice and the  relevant experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just as  there is an art to being a doctor, there is an art to being a patient. You must  choose wisely when to submit and when to assert yourself. Even when patients  decide not to decide, they should still question their physicians and insist on  explanations. The doctor should not make all these decisions and neither should  the patient. Something must be worked out between them. Where many ethicists go  wrong is in promoting patient autonomy as a kind of ultimate value in medicine  rather than recognizing it as one value among others. Schneider found that what  patients want most from doctors isn't autonomy per se; it's competence and  kindness. Now, kindness will often be involved in respecting patients'  autonomy, assuring that they have control over vital decisions. But it may also  mean taking on burdensome decisions when patients don't want them, or guiding  patients in the right direction when they do. Many ethicists find this  disturbing, and medicine will continue to struggle with how patients and  doctors ought to make decisions. But, as the field grows ever more complex and  technological, the real task isn't to banish paternalism; the real task is to  preserve kindness.

					Mr. Howe  was in his late 30s, in the hospital following an operation for a badly  infected gallbladder. Three days after his surgery, he spiked a high fever and  become short of breath. I found him sweating profusely, he had an oxygen mask  on, his heart was racing and his blood pressure was much too low. I drew blood  for tests and cultures, and went into the hall and paged S., one of the chief  residents, for help. S. came right over and went over to him, put a hand on his  shoulder, and asked how he was doing. She explained the situation: the sepsis,  the likely pneumonia, and the probability that he would get worse before he got  better. The antibiotics would fix the problem, but not instantly, she said, and  he was tiring out quickly. To get him through it, she would need to place him  on a breathing machine. "No," he gasped and sat straight up.  "Don't put me on a machine." It would not be for long, she  said. Maybe a couple of days. We'd give him sedatives so he'd be as comfortable  as possible the whole time. And - she wanted to be sure he understood - without  the ventilator he would die. He shook his head. "No machine!" He  was, we believed, making a bad decision. With antibiotics and some high-tech  support, we had every reason to believe he'd recover fully. Could we be certain  we were right? No, but if we were right, could we really just let him die? S,  looked over at Howe's wife, who was stricken with fear and, in an effort to  enlist her in the cause, asked what she thought her husband should do. She burst  into tears and left the room. Soon Howe did tire out and he gradually fell into  unconsciousness. That was when S. went into action. She slipped a breathing  tube into his trachea. We wheeled Howe to the intensive care unit. Over the  next twenty-four hours, his lungs improved markedly. He woke up and opened his  eyes, the breathing tube sticking out of his mouth. "I'm going to take  this tube out of your mouth now, OK?" I said. Then I pulled it out, and he  coughed violently a few times. "You had a pneumonia," I told him,  "but you're doing fine now." He swallowed hard, wincing from the  soreness. Then he looked at me, and, in a horse but steady voice, he said,  "Thank you."
