					The development of a new  drug is a lengthy process. Once a promising compound is identified, it must be  investigated in laboratory studies and tested on laboratory animals. After  years of work, the newly developed drug is ready for clinical trials, or the  testing on human volunteers.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this article I discuss the ethics of clinical trials using the example of  anti-fertility vaccines. In particular I argue that the ethics of clinical  testing are not confined to the recruitment stage and information provided to  participants. We need a more process-oriented perspective on the ethics of  trial participants' involvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					The research and development of anti-fertility vaccines have caused much  concern among the international women's health movement, involving many ethical  and political problems <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Saheli: Target practice.

				</p>
				<p>
					The development of anti-fertility vaccines began in the 1970s. Unlike hormonal  methods, the immunological mechanism of action causes temporary infertility by  provoking the production of antibodies against substances necessary to human  reproduction, such as certain hormones and molecules of the sperm and the ovum.  Research has been carried out in various institutions, predominantly in India  and the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research on the vaccines discussed in this article, anti-human Chorionic  Gonadotropin (CG) vaccines, is carried out under the auspices of the World  Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, by the National Institute of Immunology  (NII) in New Delhi, and by the Population Council in New York. Clinical trials  with these vaccines to test the safety and the biological effects have been  carried out since the early 1970s, on small groups of women in the United  States, India, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Finland, and Sweden <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stevens VC and Crystle CD: Effects of immunization with hapten-coupled hCG on the human menstrual cycle.

The Lancet 1988; 1295-1298." id="8">(8)</a>. A trial with 101 women was carried out in India in 1988  with the anti-hCG vaccine developed by the NII <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Talwar GP et al: Phase I clinical trials with three formulations of anti-hCG vaccine.

				</p>
				<p>
					In 1991-1992 the first efficacy trial took place, and 148 women were vaccinated  at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the Safdarjung hospital in  New Delhi, and the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in  Chandigarh <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Talwar GP et al: A vaccine that prevents pregnancy in women. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, USA 1994; 91: 8532-8536." id="10">(10)</a>. A efficacy trial of the WHO anti-hCG vaccine started in  Sweden in 1994, but was suspended a few months later because all the first  seven participants experienced serious side effects.

				<h4>Testing contraceptives</h4>
				<p>
					When a person has a disease for which no effective drug or treatment is  available, participating in a trial is often the only way to get access to a  potentially life-saving drug. This was the case with the testing of new treatments  for AIDS. In the development of new contraceptives, the situation is quite  different, because a number of more or less satisfying forms of family planning  are already available and because contraceptives are meant for healthy people.  Yet, biomedical researchers need the collaboration of trial participants to  test the safety and efficacy of a new drug.
				</p>
				<p>
					Successful clinical trials are a core requirement for the approval of a new  drug by regulatory authorities. In order to enable researchers to recruit trial  participants in an ethical manner, clinical trials generally require an  informed consent procedure. Candidates receive information on the experimental  drugs and on what their participation would involve. They must sign an informed  consent form to express their voluntary decision to participate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Internationally endorsed guidelines to regulate informed consent procedures  were recorded for the first time in 1964 in the Declaration of Helsinki,  prepared by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences in  collaboration with the WHO. They have been updated several times since then <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences: International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects. Prepared by the CIOMS in collaboration with the WHO, Geneva, 1993." id="11">(11)</a>. Worldwide, ethical review committees at research centres and funding  agencies scrutinise research proposals, information brochures, and final  reports on the basis of these guidelines. Ethical guidelines for biomedical  research involving human subjects are centred on the dual purpose of respect  for a person's right to make decisions, and protection of vulnerable persons in  biomedical research <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cook RJ and Dickens BM: Legal and ethical aspects of development and use of fertility regulating vaccines. In Ada GL and Griffin PD (Ed): Vaccines for fertility regulation: the assessment of their safety and efficacy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp 201-232." id="11">(12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have studied the trials in Australia, Sweden and India in some detail <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Van Kammen J: Conceiving contraceptives, the involvement of users in anti-fertility vaccines development. Dissertation, University of Amsterdam, 2000." id="13">(13)</a>.  In the informed consent procedures of these trials, it was believed that women  actively took the decision to become research subjects on the basis of the  information provided to them. For example, the introduction to the extensive  information brochure accompanying the informed consent form for the 1994  efficacy trial in Sweden stated that the information was "in order for you to  reach a decision". The brochure answered questions likely to be asked by  "individuals who volunteer to be in the study". Participants were "free to ask  questions at any time before and during the study". The decision to participate  in the trial would be "of your own free will" and participants could "decide to  withdraw from the study, for any reason and at any time" <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO/ HRP Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation: Phase II clinical trial protocol. Prototype anti-hCG vaccine. Geneva, May 28, 1992." id="14">(14)</a>. This mode of  addressing assumed that women had different options for action. Participation  in the trial was envisioned as one option for women, the informed consent as a  communication process, and women were seen as decision-makers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Informed consent in India</h4>
				<p>
					A different picture of women's options for action emerged from the  performance of the informed consent procedures in the phase II trial in India.  The German documentary-maker and women's health advocate Ulrike Schaz filmed  the recruitment of some women for this trial. The film showed a room in a  public hospital in New Delhi where dozens of women were standing in line  waiting to see a doctor. The doctor was sitting behind her desk and told a patient  "We have got a new injection. The effect of the injection stops children  for one year. You need not be afraid about this. The injection has no side  effects. You see this injection is absolutely 100 per cent effective. We will  also put in a copper-T. Continuous copper-T is not very good. If you have it  three years, six years, then there is the risk of cancer. That is why we want  you to change <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Schaz U and Schneider I: Antibodies against pregnancy: the dream of the perfect birth from the laboratory. Documentary film, 1991. English copy available through USchaz, Hamburg." id="15">(15)</a>."
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctor's statements diverged from the protocol. She said the anti-fertility  vaccine was a new injection instead of an experimental method for which the  duration and efficacy were yet to be established. And there is no evidence  three or six years of copper-T use increases the risk of cancer. As a matter  of fact the research protocol for this trial had been approved by the Drugs  Controller of India, the institutional ethics committees, and the ethics review  committee of the Canadian International Development and Research Center, one of  the funders of clinical research at the NII
				</p>
				<p>
					The film caused concern among researchers and policy makers involved in the  development of anti-hCG vaccine. This representation of a trial participant  differed from the one that researchers had been addressing in their information  brochures. While the scene underscored the importance of proper information,  the candidate's options for action seemed to depend on more than communication  processes. Informed consent appeared not as a communication and decision making  process, but as a form of social intervention in a specific context, producing  and reproducing power-relations.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The context of research</h4>
				<p>
					Moreover, the ethics of clinical trials go beyond the need for well-performed informed consent procedures. Ethics and politics are involved in the  context in which clinical trials are carried out, and in organisational  features as well. This becomes very clear when we compare the Indian and  Swedish trials. In India, women's daily life situations facilitated their  enrollment and continuation in the trial. Researchers who studied the 1991-1992 clinical trials in India point out that the most frequently mentioned  advantage of participation in clinical trials was improved access to medical  care. Private clinics are unaffordable and government medical treatment usually  meant missing work and waiting for hours at public hospitals. As clinical trial  participants, they and their families received priority treatment <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Viswanath K. and Kirbat P: Genealogy of a controversy: development of an anti-fertility vaccine. Working paper number 7. Social Science and Immunisation Project, University of Delhi, 1997." id="16">(16)</a>.  Researchers also make participation attractive to prevent drop-outs, by  providing a waiting area, cold drinks and snacks, and reimbursement for travel  expenses and time lost from employments <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kirbat P: Conducting fieldwork in clinical trial settings: anthropological and ethical remarks. Medische Antropologie 1998: 10: 85-93." id="17">(17)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women participating in clinical trials often use it as a means for improving  their existing situation. They are in their own way getting access to an extra  income, improved health care, and a sense of identity and social space outside  their homes. On the other hand, one can argue that these motivations provided  by the research center in some ways take undue advantage of the situation of  low income, uneducated women by providing them with opportunities they would  otherwise not have <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kirbat P: Conducting fieldwork in clinical trial settings: anthropological and ethical remarks. Medische Antropologie 1998: 10: 85-93." id="17">(17)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As Kirbat has signalled there is a tension between women as actively seeking to  become research in a specific situation. Importantly, health care,  reimbursement and other such provisions were effective only for poor women. The  provision of a social space outside the home might not have been significant to  men, and access to good-quality health care was not an issue for richer people.  The researchers' arrangements suited a specific category of clinical trial  participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants in the 1994 Swedish trial, too, were reimbursed for travel  expenses, time lost for employment, and other trial-related expenses. However,  participation provided no personal benefits, apart from the eventual anti-fertility effect during the efficacy stage of the trial and a thorough medical  examination <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO/ HRP Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation: Phase II clinical trial protocol. Prototype anti-hCG vaccine. Geneva, May 28, 1992." id="14">(14)</a>. The researchers encountered many problems in enrolling and  keeping a sufficient number of trial participants. The original recruitment  targets in the Swedish trial were 50 subjects in each of the two participating  hospitals. A total of 61 women contacted the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm  in response to its initial publicity about the trial, and 17 of them remained  potentially available after the interview and the screening. In the Uppsala  University Hospital, a total of 16 women expressed interest and three of them  passed the interview and the screening stages <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Steering committee clinical trials subcommittee: Minutes meeting. Uppsala, 29 June, 1994." id="18">(18)</a>. The representative of a  company involved, Mats Ehrnebo, wrote in a progress report to the WHO:
				</p>
				<p>
					There has been a slower than expected patient recruitment. (...) It is planned  then for a more extensive patient recruitment. (...) every aspect that could  raise the number of patients that could be screened should be encouraged <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ehrnebo M: Progress report, September 27, 1994. Unpublished paper." id="19">(19)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Researchers in Sweden had fewer opportunities to make participation in the  trial attractive to women. Improved access to health care was not relevant for  these women. For poor women in India, the clinical trials could provide a  welcome opportunity to obtain better access to superior health care, an extra  income and a social space outside their homes. Because of women's different  spectrum of options, it was easier to recruit and keep women in the trials in  India than in Sweden. This illustrates how the politics and ethics of clinical  trials are not confined to obtaining women's informed consent to participate.  Their participation and continuation in the trial depended not only on their  understanding of the information provided to them, but also on the contexts and  the power relations in which they were engaged.
				</p>
				<p>
					How could this finding be handled in practice? First, the provision of clear  and adequate information remains a key issue, and ethic committees should  intensify their surveillance of clinical testing. Second, the finding that women's  options for action differ according to their situation-and hence the  ethicality of their participation should play a role in the selection of trial  centres. Finally, persons who can represent the users' perspectives should be  involved in the planning, organisation, and evaluation of clinical trials. In  the case of anti-hCG vaccines, some researchers from the WHO have proposed  that women's health advocates could play a role in monitoring the conduct of  clinical trials of new contraceptive methods.

It offers to handle all aspects and stages of clinical  trials, to speed up the process, reduce costs and get the 'product' to the  market fast. Research from trials carried out in Europe will be used to get US  FDA approval. "From here we can help you conduct clinical studies more  efficiently and to a lower cost than in the US. One ICH GCP compliant study run  for you by us in Scandinavia may be approved by regulatory agencies covering  more than 90% of the worldwide market-including the US, Europe and Far East.  In Scandinavia, trials typically begin and end sooner than in the US. This  means you can begin generating revenue in Europe while awaiting FDA approval.
