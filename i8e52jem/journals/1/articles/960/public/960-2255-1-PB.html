				<h4>Janani Suraksha Yojana &ndash; an assessment</h4>
				<p>
					Concerns about India's high maternal and infant mortality
					rates urged the state to introduce the Janani Suraksha Yojana
					(JSY) in 2005. This article takes a sample of 9504 households
					over 471 villages (all in low-performing states) to assess the
					performance of JSY with respect to a few key parameters.
					Initially the eligibility criteria for JSY beneficiaries were the
					same for women across high- and low-performing states; but
					certain changes were made in the scheme for women from the
					low-performing states to be able to get the optimum benefits
					from the scheme. Now, women from below the poverty line
					families who deliver at home are eligible for benefits, unlike
					those in high performing states. However, only 11% of all
					women delivering at home were actually receiving the money,
					often in instalments, and they had to travel to the nearest
					institution for it, in contravention of the JSY guidelines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the accredited social health activists (ASHAs) were
					underperforming, and the authors suggest that delay in
					their payments is a major reason for this. The authors found
					that the majority of women who deliver at home are from the
					lowest socioeconomic classes and argue that they should be
					the primary focus for the ASHAs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The article ends with a set of speculations on the reasons
					why women abstain from accessing the institution. Cultural
					mandates urging the preference for home deliveries, problems
					of accessing the institution, lack of awareness about the benefits
					of institutional delivery, and considerations of expenses and
					inadequate infrastructure at the institutions are some of them.

				<h4>Using technology to enable autonomy</h4>
				<p>
					Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly being used in
					the treatment of motor functioning and mood disorders. Its
					use has sometimes led to unintended psychiatric symptoms,
					including positive or negative "complications". This has
					important consequences for the patient's sense of identity
					and agency. This is true for other brain-based interventions
					as well. However, what is unique to DBS is that (i) its influence
					on identity can be dissociated by deactivating the device and
					(ii) an identity change is observed by the family and friends of
					the patient; but no discontinuity is experienced by the patient
					herself. By analysing a particular case, the authors show that
					such changes can be experienced as a threat to one's sense
					of agency and free will. The authors define free will as "the capacity to initiate and execute plans of action." They argue
					that the deep brain implant should be viewed as an enabling
					tool which helps the patient recover a sufficient conscious
					control over her thought and behaviour to feel that she is their
					genuine source, rather than that something alien has replaced
					her authentic self as the agent. The authors conclude that by
					allowing for key brain functions to be studied in real time, the
					DBS technology can yield some important insights regarding
					the essential philosophical question of "who we are."

				<h4>A case for open patient-level data in clinical trials</h4>
				<p>
					In this article, the authors, as representatives of the European
					Medicines Agency, state the case for open access to patientlevel
					data in clinical research. Firstly, access to full data would
					lead to improvement in the design and analysis of trials by (i)
					enrichment (reducing the necessary sample size); (ii) allowing
					for comprehensive quality-controlled databases whose
					meta-analyses could inform future projects; and (iii) enabling
					historical controls to be used in research on rare diseases
					where randomised controlled trials are not possible. Secondly,
					information from previous trials about the heterogeneity
					of treatment effects will increase the value of the drug in
					the marketplace. Thirdly, companies would have to invest
					less in presenting comparative-effectiveness information
					about their product instead of running head-to-head trials
					on the same product. Lastly, it will reduce duplication costs
					as drug developers will cease to pursue research where
					previous attempts have shown the futility of a similar effort.
					Pharmaceutical industry organisations have resisted openaccess
					to patient- data by raising concerns about "free-riding"
					that would diminish the incentive for biomedical research.
					While the authors acknowledge the importance of protecting
					intellectual property rights, they argue that it would be cheaper
					and more beneficial for these agencies to participate in a
					managed-release environment for sharing patient-level data
					while ensuring patient privacy.
