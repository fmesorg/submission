					Come election time and  the government's mind turns to thoughts of the people's welfare, or at least to  the appearance of it. A perennial favourite of every government that wishes  to show its commitment to the people's well &ndash; being is health care. So it is not  surprising that the DMK government in Tamilnadu has a flurry of health camps.  Also, the Corporation of Chennai, which it controls, has announced an increased  outlay for health in this year's budget. But how deep is the commitment? Very  shallow, one fears.

					As states go, Tamilnadu  is one of those whose health indices are better than the national average. But  how much this is due to efforts on the part of this or previous governments is  a moot point. One can say for certain that we are nowhere near attaining the  Alma Ata goal of Health for All. It is also true that severe disparities exist  not only in the provision of basic amenities that make for healthy living, but  also in curative services. Since the 1993 World Bank report gave "intellectual"  or "theoretical" sanction for the withdrawal of the government from any but the  most basic curative services, the Tamilnadu government has been quietly  downgrading its services. This is done in a subtle fashion. Official policy is  not to turn any patient away, and not to refuse any service. But the reality is  that many elective services are simply not provided, or provided after such  long waiting periods, that the patient just goes away. It is exceptional for a  patient to get a total hip replacement in a government institution. The cost to  the individual and the nation of having so many unhealthy or barely healthy  people is incalculable. For the politicians, however, such long-term considerations  have no value. After all, as the famous economist John Maynard Keynes said:  &quot;In the long run we are all dead.&quot; They prefer the health camp:  numerous doctors descend on a village with some political flunkey in the  limelight and 'screen' patients. Having discovered that so many need cardiac  valve replacements or whatever, they refer them to the nearest medical college  hospital, which, as everyone knows, hasn't done one for years! By the time the  patient discovers this, election time has come and gone.

					From the 1980s, the  corporate hospital has been the buzzword among medical entrepreneurs. Fired by  the success of the Apollo group, many others jumped on to the bandwagon. A lot  of them have been unable to replicate the financial accomplishment of Apollo.  The closure of the Tamilnadu Hospital on the outskirts of Chennai is  symptomatic of the predicament that many others find themselves in. Sadly, a  lot of public money is in these institutions in the form of loans, notably from  the beleaguered Indian Bank and from ICICI (Industrial Credit and Investment  Corporation of India). It says something about the priorities of the government  that lending institutions controlled by it give soft loans to these hospitals  which are solely for those who can pay well, while the government does little  for the underprivileged. It is not unusual to find public sector institutions  and banks gifting expensive equipment to private institutions. For example,  this month the State Bank of India donated an expensive ophthalmic laser to a  private hospital. It would seem that a government hospital would be the more  appropriate place for such largesse. The only reason that seems plausible for  such donations is that the institution concerned offers some concessional treatment  to the employees of the donor organisation. But is it right for a public sector  enterprise to divert part of the profits for the private gain of its  employees? It is also a sign of the complete shift of the middle class to  the private sector for medical care. What this has meant is that the sovereign,  socialist, democratic republic of India is witnessing ever more stratification  of its citizens. Government hospitals are filthy, poorly equipped and  unresponsive. Instead of improving them, we have abandoned them to the  voiceless poor. Surely it is a sign of a sick society that its citizens care so  little for each other, and are so little involved in civic affairs that they do  not understand or are unwilling to fight for basic services. This is the syndrome  of: If there are power cuts get a generator, if the phone service is poor  get a cell phone, and so on. Unfortunately, once in a way along  comes a plague or an earthquake to remind us all about the importance of good  infrastructure as a basic right. Equally unfortunately, we do not seem to have  learnt the lesson yet.

					And the politicians  think that a camp once in a while will bring in the votes.
