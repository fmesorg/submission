  <p>In October 2000 the General Assembly of the World
    Medical Association (WMA) met in the UK.
    This highest decision-making body of the WMA
    discussed, among other issues, the wording of the latest
    revised version of the Declaration of Helsinki <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="http://www.wits.ac.za/bioethics/helsinki.htm." id="1">(1)</a>, the pivotal
    international ethics document guiding medical research.
    Nearly two years of international controversy over the
    document's wording and content came to a conclusion. During
    this process, the Secretary General reported, the WMA was
    flooded with hundreds of comments, resolutions and discussion
    documents from individuals, national medical associations and
    non-governmental organisations the world over.</p>
  <p>At the heart of the controversy were two questions: Is it
    conceptually feasible to uphold the distinction between
    therapeutic and non-therapeutic research? Should there be
    a universal prescribed standard of clinical care or should a
    local standard of care apply? This report focuses on the
    second question.</p>
  <p>A US-based agenda was the driving force behind the initial
    changes to the Declaration. The pre-October 2000 version
    read: In any medical study, every patient &ndash; including those
    of any control group, if any &ndash; should be assured of the best
    proven diagnostic and therapeutic method. A draft with
    revisions to the Declaration, circulated in March 1999, read:
    In any biomedical research protocol every patient-subject,
    including those of a control group, if any, should be assured
    that he or she will not be denied access to the best proven
    diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic method that would
    otherwise be available to him or her.</p>
  <p>Obviously an attempt was made to change the parameters
    of what level of clinical care should be provided to trial
    participants from a scientific to an economic standard.</p>
  <p>A debate ensued internationally over the ethics of this <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Schuklenk U, Ashcroft R. International research ethics. Bioethics 2000; 14: 158-172." id="2">(2)</a>. The dividing lines between the debating camps were not
    clear-cut, but it became obvious that, for instance, of the
    WMA national member associations, the American Medical
    Association and the British Medical Association supported
    differential standards of care, while continental European,
    Japanese, Latin American and the South African Medical
    Associations rejected this strategy. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WMA. Memorandum to National Medical Associations July 1, 2000." id="3">(3)</a> The initial proposal
    to revise the Declaration was made by the American Medical
    Association. Arguably the AMA and the BMA were more
    prepared than most other medical associations to accept as
    a given the economic disparities we see between developed
    and developing countries. They tried to design a research
    ethics guideline which allows economic factors to impinge
    on clinical standards of care, while the other organisations
    refused to accept this. The German medical association was
    driven by an absolutist, universalist principle based
    approach that would not countenance differential standards
    of care. These different responses are not necessarily an
    indication of less or greater concern for research subjects in these different countries and cultures; they are indicative of
    different approaches to and understanding of the
    Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
  <p>The idea of differential standards of care was retained in
    the draft proposal discussed by the WMA in May 2000: In
    any medical study, every patient &ndash; including those of any
    control group, if any &ndash; should be assured of proven effective
    prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods.</p>
  <p>Using the example of AIDS treatments, it is possible to
    follow this guideline to the letter by providing effective
    treatment that is so substantially below the best proven
    treatment that it does not ensure the patient's survival.</p>
  <p>In October 2000 the General Assembly of the WMA met in
    Edinburgh. It adopted this version in the revised Declaration:
    The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new
    method should be tested against those of the best current
    prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods.</p>
  <p>In trials other than for preventive vaccines this requirement,
    if adhered to by investigators, would eliminate the possibility
    of poor research subjects in developing countries being
    exploited by western researchers.</p>
  <p>The revised version of the Declaration includes a note on
    post-trial availability of drugs to the trial subjects: At the
    conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study
    should be assured of access to the best proven prophylactic,
    diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study.
    If implemented by trial sponsors, it means that those who
    made the development and testing of a new drug possible,
    because they volunteered as research subjects, will be
    provided any drug successfully tested.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this will not help prevent deaths in
    preventive vaccine trials. For example, people infected during
    HIV vaccine trials will not be provided post-trial with the
    best proven AIDS treatments. Ongoing UNAIDS-backed
    trials accept HIV infections of trial participants (for instance
    those resulting from a research subject's therapeutic
    misconception) as inevitable, but refuse to provide to these
    HIV-infected trial subjects essential AIDS medication. The
    revised version of the Declaration is silent on this matter.
    Since trial subjects need only be provided with drugs
    "identified by the study", and preventive vaccine trials will
    not identify treatments, the Declaration does not require
    that subjects infected during a vaccine trial be provided
    essential medication. The consequences will be particularly
    disastrous for research subjects affected by AIDS.</p>
  <p>The standards of current research ethics, as set by the
    Declaration of Helsinki, are better than what was expected
    when the first drafts were circulated. It is reassuring that the
    organisation did not allow itself to be pressured into
    lowering standards of clinical care during clinical trials.
    However, the WMA ignores the problems preventive vaccine
    trials will cause.</p>
