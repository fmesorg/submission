				<h4>Pharmaceutical surveys</h4>
				<p>
					An agency called C MARC  (2 Bhaskar Mansion, 31 Sitladevi Temple Road, Mahim, Mumbai 400 016) sent its  representative to 'survey' doctors regarding the kind of prescriptions that are  written against a type of disease/disorder/condition. The aim is to collect  100 successive prescriptions from one doctor, analyse the kind of drugs  prescribed for a particular disease and analyse the trends of prescription and  the consistency of prescribing. Patients' names are kept confidential.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is expected that in one year, 600 prescriptions will have been submitted.  For this, A4-sized prescriptions in duplicate are provided to doctors, with  their names, degrees and appointments printed on the main page (not the  duplicate), free of cost by C MARC. The original copy goes to the patient; the  duplicate is returned to the agency. Should the doctor finish his quota of 600  prescriptions in a year, more stationery is provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					Will the Forum for Medical Ethics Society inform us if this practice is  ethical? Is it right to enter into such a liaison with an agency and give away  prescriptions for "analysis"? Would not doctors be enticed to write more-than-necessary drugs to show how busy and heavy their practice is?
				</p>
				<p>
					I do not mind any kind of research activity and am more than willing to help,  provided that it is ethical and ultimately helps the patient, not the doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please let me know if you are aware of such a scheme.

				<h4>Abortion in India: not a right but a state-sponsored programme</h4>
				<p>
					Our population control measures with their top-down, state-enforced  approach, and their coercive, autonomy-violating components, need  re-examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-therapeutic abortions (abortions other than those performed to save the  life of the mother) are freely promoted, aggressively marketed and effectively  enforced by state-co-opted medical professionals. Their unabashed enthusiasm  to undertake non-therapeutic interventions is unethical, to say the least. But  then, ethics are the first casualty when the state drafts the medical  profession to solve social problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					I do not oppose all abortions, but I am certainly against the state sponsored  abortion programme. The state encourages unsafe abortions by default, when it  does not enforce the safety provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy  Act. It also does the same thing by design, by tacitly approving unsafe  abortion as a population control (read family planning) measure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any abortion involves the fundamental rights of two individuals -the mother and  the foetus. While a woman has a right to privacy &mdash; the right not to have her  own body interfered with &mdash; I believe that the foetus, too, has a right to life,  a right to survive. To reconcile these two conflicting rights, and in deference  to the rights of women, it has been legally decided that the woman's right  takes precedence till the foetus reaches 12 weeks of age. After that, the  foetus is a legal person whose life cannot be taken away except by due process  of law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women's demands for contraception and abortion have been assiduously  manipulated by the State towards its population control strategy. The medical  termination of pregnancy is not provided as a reproductive right of women for  unwanted pregnancies (to be exercised in the first 12 weeks). It is  aggressively promoted as part of the state's population policy (up to 20 weeks  by law and after that by default).
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to the pressure of the international community (read developed nations),  Indian women of the reproductive age are at the mercy of the state and state-co-opted nongovernment organisations. No means are considered improper for the  great cause of population control, promoted and financed by international  agencies. Ethics are considered senseless niceties and safety norms are  impractical in the face of the urgent need for population control. In fact, the  state-sponsored programme for contraception and medical termination of  pregnancy is a state-enforced medical solution to the social problem of  poverty.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not against contraception, but it has to be as a freely available and  accessible choice of individuals and not a state enforced or coerced measure.  In India, contraception is promoted not as an individual choice but as a demand  of the state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Infanticide for reasons of poverty was justly considered barbaric. But the  elimination of five million foetuses through MTPs, for the same reasons, brings  international acclaim and rewards of funds. The deaths of thousands of women  from septic abortions and improperly performed tubectomies are overlooked with  impunity. The right of the state to eliminate foetuses, or to prevent children  from being born alive, has no explicit or implicit sanction in the  constitution. Let there be a debate on this subject.
