				<h4>Torture  by doctors?</h4>
				<p>
					When  Abdul Karim Telgi, accused in the stamp paper scam, was injected with sodium  pentothal, the results were apparently excellent, according to the director of  the Karnataka State Forensic Laboratory. 'He vomited out the truth.' The thrill  was partly due to the 'complicated' nature of Telgi's case. 'We were  particularly happy since Telgi is also HIV positive, and this proves that we  can tackle even complicated medical cases.' After a campaign by human rights  activists, a Bangalore court restricted the administration of the drug to some  Telgi case accused.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr S L  Vaya at the Ahmedabad Forensic Science Laboratory has used sodium pentothal a  number of times including against the accused in the Godhra burning. He  describes this as a therapeutic experience: 'The result is a catharsis-like  confession.' The use of truth drugs constitutes torture, according to the UN.

				<h4>'It  only raises our death figures'</h4>
				<p>
					Authorities  at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi have urged its consultants not to admit  patients in an 'irretrievable condition' to the ICU and to personally make sure  they have no infection. A senior consultant in the hospital argues that this  'strange order' goes against the basic tenet of medical science-that till a  person is actually dead you cannot write him off and no matter how serious the  case may be, a doctor has to treat him. Also, the doctor cannot say whether a  patient has an infection just by looking at him/her.
					<br />
					Dr  Nalini Kaul, medical director, says, 'The notice was issued because of the  esteem our hospital holds in people's minds. As a result, it often gets  moribund cases from other hospitals in a last-ditch effort by relatives to  revive them. We are not able to help them and they often die within 24 hours of  admission. No purpose is achieved except raising our death figures and often  causing cross-infection in other patients.

				<h4>'We  got her oral consent'</h4>
				<p>
					A  32-year-old woman in Kerala has sued an infertility centre for allegedly  implanting donor ova in her-without her knowledge and permission. Anitha  Jayadevan has filed a case against Edappal Hospitals Private Limited, claiming  Rs 20 lakh as compensation. She learned what happened after a DNA test was done  elsewhere when the pregnancy failed.
					<br />
					Dr K K  Gopinathan of the infertility centre states that the patient and her husband  gave their oral consent to the use of donor ova. This oral consent was not  recorded to keep the information from the hospital staff, as requested by the  couple.

				<h4>Doctors  arrange surrogate mothers</h4>
				<p>
					About  10 babies are delivered by surrogate mothers in Ahmedabad every year. Doctors  look for healthy women under 30 years of age, from lower-middle-class families.  They are paid between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh plus all medical expenses. It  is the doctor's responsibility to ensure that the surrogate mother gets her  payment and that she hands over the baby after delivery. Rupam Jain Nair.

				<h4>Doctors  in politics</h4>
				<p>
					Deputy  prime minister L K Advani's two-day visit to his constituency was marked by  seven medical camps. Everywhere he went, doctors doled out free consultations  and even X-ray examinations and pathology tests. His example is followed by  other politicians. In Rajkot, sitting MP and union minister of state for health  Vallabh Kathiriya organised a camp in which even operations were conducted,  some done by the MP himself. Specialists from Delhi government hospitals were  brought in to prescribe drugs to 20,000 patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Doctors  will easily be the most sought-after people for campaigning this election. Once  the dates are announced there will be a flood of requests to doctors to hold  medical camps across the state. The reason is simple: medical camps give  instant results in terms of pleasing the vote bank,' said president of the  Indian Medical Association Anil Nayak. The finest example of the kind of  influence doctors can wield is that of BJP's Jeetendra Patel who had no party  base but won due to the goodwill of 1,500 doctors who went door to door  canvassing for him, according to a senior doctor. Doctors are asked to canvass  for parties on a personal basis, because of their immense hold over their  patients.

				<h4>Unsafe  injecting practices</h4>
				<p>
					Sixty-five  per cent of injections given in the country are unsafe, according to a report  submitted to the government. The reasons: reuse, wrong injecting habits and  improper syringe disposal techniques. The study looked at practices in 2,400  government and private facilities and 1,200 immunisation centres.

				<h4>Strengthening  the complaint mechanism</h4>
				<p>
					The  Supreme Court gave three weeks to the Centre to frame into law three changes in  the Code of Medical Ethics and Regulations for investigating complaints of  medical negligence.
					<br />
					The  three new rules that will be added in Section 8 (relating to Punishment and  Disciplinary Action against doctors) of the Medical Council Act (MCA) are: (i)  A complaint against doctors will be automatically transferred to the central  MCI for adjudication six months after filing the complaint before any State  Medical Council (SMC). (ii) Alleged victims of medical negligence may appeal  against the decision by any SMC directly to the MCI. (iii) Non-medical members  will have to be included in the body of all medical councils to avoid any  conflict of interest in the investigation of allegations against errant  doctors. (Currently only the Delhi Medical Council has members who are  non-doctors).

				<h4>Private  medical colleges fall short of staff</h4>
				<p>
					Only  one of the 17 private medical colleges in Maharashtra-run mostly by state  politicians-has the staff and facilities to fulfil the norms of the Medical  Council of India, according to a probe by the state department of medical  education. The rest had a more than five per cent shortage of staff. Most staff  worked part time; in some colleges professors shown as full-time staffers said  they were part-time employees. The area set aside for medical education was put  to other uses, including engineering, dental, catering and occupational therapy  teaching.

				<h4>Medical  colleges in Bihar</h4>
				<p>
					Bihar  is likely to be left with only one government medical college with the  executive committee of the Medical Council of India (MCI) recommending  de-recognition of five state-run medical institutes in the state. They had been  on notice for the past four to six years for glaring deficiencies that they  failed to improve. If the general body of the MCI ratifies the decision, the  state would be left with only one government medical college and two private  medical colleges.

				<h4>Professors  linked to question paper leak</h4>
				<p>
					The CBI  arrested Lucknow resident Dhirender Singh for his alleged involvement in  stealing and leaking of a question paper of the All India Post Graduate Medical  Education entrance examination in January 2002. Reports that the papers had  been leaked gained credibility after the results were declared and 70 of the  top 100 candidates from UP belonged to the King George Medical University  (KGMU), most from the S P Hostel where the papers were reportedly distributed.  Earlier, five others had been arrested for their alleged involvement, including  an assistant professor of the KGMU and owners of two coaching institutes.

				<h4>Deaths  in public hospitals</h4>

					Tapan  Deyashi, an asthma patient who went missing from R G Kar Medical College and  Hospital, Kolkata was found draped over a garbage vat outside the hospital,  dead from severe cold and shock.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  past three months, at least five patients have walked out of state-run  hospitals in the city, with the authorities remaining in the dark. In October  2003, Santosh Hela, a patient of Howrah State General Hospital, was found dead  near a garbage vat, a day after he went missing. In another incident, a patient  was killed after he reportedly jumped out of a window from the second floor of  B N Bose Hospital in Barrackpore.

				<h4>The  kidney trade again</h4>
				<p>
					Frontline's  latest addition to its collection of stories on the kidney trade notes that the  latest guidelines of the Tamil Nadu government have not solved the problem. No  action has been taken on police cases revealing a nexus among donors, agents,  hospitals and recipients. According to a recent study, 'Implementation of  THOA', by Dr V R Muraleedharan and S Ram Prasad, Indian Institute of  Technology, Chennai, 'the commercialisation of kidneys is as common now as it  was before the implementation of the Act and the present regulatory system is  incapable of preventing it'.

				<h4>The  future of clinical trials in India</h4>
				<p>
					Indian  contract research organisations (CROs) can access the US$10 billion market for  clinical trials if the health ministry makes policy changes enabling clinical  trials in India along the lines of those elsewhere, according to the consulting  firm Ernst &amp; Young. Currently India does not allow Phase I human trials  (initial administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers  to determine the maximum tolerated dose) to be conducted in case of drugs of  foreign origin, unless and until the trial is conducted outside India and the  data are submitted to the drug regulator.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to the report titled 'India's clinical capabilities', the clinical research  sector will play a major role in India's biotech future. The Mashelkar panel,  which was given a mandate to propose a revamp of the country's drug regulatory  set-up, has recommended that Phase I clinical trials of new drugs of foreign  origin in India be allowed at the same time as they are being carried out  abroad.
				</p>
				<p>
					Director  of the National Institute of Immunology Sandip Basu states that India's vast  and diverse disease and patient populations provide an enormous clinical  research opportunity.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to the report, international CROs have already recognised this opportunity and  have set up operations in anticipation of policy changes. US-based Quintiles  Transnational Corp has shifted the bulk of its data processing activity to  India. Indian CROs too are mushrooming. According to the chairman of Biocon  India, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, apart from Phase I clinical trials, Indian  companies have a large opportunity in pre-clinical and proof of concept  studies. 'The real opportunity lies in shortening timelines by speedy patient  enrolments, made possible by the large patient populations that also lend themselves  to sub-segmentation and statistically superior data,' she added.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  report said biotech companies in the US and Europe can forward integrate their  drug development programmes at lower cost and shorter timelines in India.

				<h4>Infant  burnt by make-shift incubator</h4>

					The  state government has ordered inquiries into the death of an infant at the Jowai  Civil Hospital, Meghalaya. The newborn suffered extensive burn injuries  allegedly after it was kept on a metallic tray with a room heater below it, and  died on November 27, 2003. Family sources said although the discharge slip  showed that the mother was discharged on request on November 26, she was  actually discharged on November 27 after the death of her child.

				<h4>Doctors'  strike-1</h4>
				<p>
					About  2,000 junior doctors and 10,000 students of 10 government-owned medical  colleges in Andhra Pradesh went on strike to demand a halt to indiscriminate  sanctioning of private medical colleges and to end collection of user charges  in state-run hospitals. The government declined to discuss the demands saying  that these issues were part of its policies and were non-negotiable. The  doctors called off their strike after 42 days, following a direction by the  Andhra Pradesh High Court, and agreed to join a committee with the government  to find a solution for their demands.

					In  Karnataka, doctors of the J J M Medical College, Bapuji Child Health Institute,  and Bapuji Dental College went on strike when the hospital management demanded  that they execute a bond promising not to do private practice. They withdrew  the strike after three days. The chairman of the Bapuji Education Association  refused to negotiate even if all the doctors resigned en masse. He said he  asked for the bond as he had heard that doctors were diverting patients from  the hospitals to their nursing homes.

				<h4>Complaints  against doctors in Pakistan</h4>
				<p>
					More  than 200 complaints against different doctors are pending with the Pakistan  Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), allowing many accused doctors to continue  examining patients, according to senior physician Aziz Khan Tank.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the  other hand, Dr Habibur Rehman Soomro, a senior member of the Association said  that dozens of complaints had been dealt with by the PMA over the years. 'And I  am happy to tell you that in 70% of the cases, we suggested that steps be taken  against the erring doctors.' Reporters were told that people who had complaints  against doctors must lodge them in the prescribed manner with the PMA. No  doctor would be spared provided complaints were lodged in a proper manner.

				<h4>Negligent  treatment in Bangladesh</h4>
				<p>
					Day  labourer Mofiz Uddin's wife Rashida Begum had been comatose for three weeks  before the medical authorities responded to a complaint by her husband. Rashida  was admitted to a clinic for abdominal pain, allegedly through the help of a  broker. Her husband was told that his wife had a tumour in her ovary which  needed to be removed. She was operated upon by a medical officer of Paba  Upazila Health and Family Welfare Centre.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  official probe revealed that no laboratory tests were carried out before the  operation; somebody 'not specialised in surgery' operated upon her; the patient  developed cerebral hypoxia due to the anaesthesia; and the clinic her  unregistered. The investigation took place only after her husband complained.  There is no mechanism whereby such gross violation of professional ethics would  be automatically noted and remedial action taken.
