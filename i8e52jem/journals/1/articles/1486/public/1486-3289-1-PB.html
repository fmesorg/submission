					Is DOTs a breakthrough or inappropriate strategy in the Indian context?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Since  1993, directly observed therapy short course (DOTS) has been adapted and tested  in India on more than 200 lakh population in various parts of the country, with  excellent results <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central TB Division, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi. Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme. 1997." id="7">(7)</a>. This comprehensive strategy has been incorporated into  India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTP) and will be  implemented in a phased manner in a population of nearly 300 million over the  next three years.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is an emerging debate around DOTS in India. Some claim that the strategy  is a 'breakthrough' in the treatment of tuberculosis. Others disagree, having  strong feelings, for example, about the importance of daily (versus  intermittent) therapy or about the implications of direct observation. Some of  these critics suggest that DOTS as it currently stands is simply inappropriate  in the Indian context. All of these groups have data to support their positions.  This paper suggests that the needs of Indians with TB can best be met through  uniting these groups and engaging in a creative process of development and  change. Applying the perspectives of public health and ethics can assist this  process and can support the creation of a strong and effective response to the  management of tuberculosis in India. It is hoped that by its publication here,  this essay may help to instigate a debate within India, amongst Indian  scholars, practitioners and policy makers about the usefulness of these  concepts within the specific social, cultural, economic and political context  of the subcontinent.

				<h4>The production of health</h4>
				<p>
					Public health is often defined as 'providing the conditions in which  people can be healthy' <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Institute of Medicine 1988. The future of public health. National Academy Press: Washington DC. (pp. 1-7)." id="13">(13)</a>. In practice this means that public health  policies, programmes and practitioners are called upon to support both the  health of the individual and the health of the wider community. Yet the needs  of the individual are not always - or even usually - consonant with the needs  of the community. This basic dichotomy can create tension and conflict within  public health and between public health, clinical medicine, patients and  communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In recent years a number of definitions of health have emerged which challenge  us to look beyond the narrow view of health as being the mere absence of  disease and towards a concept of the production of health and 'healthy  communities' <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kickbusch A 1997. New players for a new era: responding to the global public health challenges. J Public Health Medicine 19(2): 171-178." id="14">(14</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Porter JDH, Ogden JO, Pronyk P. In press. The way forward: an international approach to tuberculosis control. In JDH Porter and J Grange, Eds. Tuberculosis - an interdisciplinary perspective. Imperial College Press London." id="22">22)</a>. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), for  example, health is a state of total physical, social and mental well-being  <a class="reference" href="#thirtyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO 1946. Constitution of the World Health Organisation. New York, World Health Organisation." id="31">(31)</a>. Baer et al <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baer HA, Singer M &amp; Johnson JH. 1986. Towards a critical medical anthropology. SSM Vol 23 (2): 95-8." id="2">(2)</a> suggest that health may be usefully thought of as "access  to and control over the basic material and nonmaterial resources that sustain  and promote life at a high level of satisfaction". By situating health within  the broader contours of people's lives, these definitions enable us to think  about how health is created effectively de-emphasising the view that the key to  health is merely the treatment of disease.

				<h4>Ethics, morality and relationship</h4>
				<p>
					Ethics is 'the science of morals in human conduct' <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Porter JDH. Public health and morals. Lancet 1996; 348: 618-9." id="21">(21)</a>, wherein  'moral' is 'concerned with goodness or badness of character or disposition, or  with the distinction between right and wrong'. More simply, ethics can be  understood as 'learning to live together' <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bonhoeffer D. 1971. Ethics. McMillan, London and New York." id="5">(5)</a>: at its root it is about  relationship and how we use relationships to develop 'community'. Ethical  principles can be used to manage conflict and to find a way forward that is  appropriate both for individuals and the communities in which they live. At the  core of ethics are human questions about right and wrong ('values'), criteria  for guiding human action and codes of conduct that communities develop to  assist the process of living together.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ironically, perhaps, there are also disagreements and dichotomies within  ethics. Currently the discipline of ethics is polarised between those who  assert that there exists a 'core morality' possessed by the inhabitants of  most, if not all, human communities and those who emphasise local narratives,  the heterogeneity of cultures, incommensurable moral worlds, and a diversity of  moral tongues <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Turner L 1998. An anthropological exploration of contemporary bioethics: the varieties of common sense. Journal of Medical Ethics 1998; 24: 127-133." id="27">(27)</a>. These opposing perspectives are important when considering  the universality of ethical principles.
			  </p>
				<p>
					For those who argue the importance of local narratives, the forces acting on the  creation of ethical principles are highly variable by time and place, by  politics and economics, by religion and science. Although taking ethical  principles from one country to another and from one culture to another is  difficult, there do appear to be some common features between frameworks. How  relevant are the ethical principles constructed internationally to India? Could  they be useful? In this essay we argue that these principles can assist in  providing a perspective for supporting and improving the current RNTP and for  bringing together the disparate views currently being voiced in the debate on  DOTS.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics principles and tasks</h4>
				<p>
					Beaufort and Dupuis <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beaufort I. D., Dupuis H. M. (1988), Handboek Gezondheidsethiek. Van Gorcum, Assen/Maastricht." id="4">(4)</a> have suggested that the ethical process might  be used to clarify concepts, analyse and structure arguments, weigh  alternatives, and provide advice on an "appropriate" course of action. Another  way of looking at ethical argument is that it can assist us to identify the  obstacles to acting "morally". Once these obstacles have been identified, it is  easier to find ways of overcoming them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The four principles currently used by bioethicists are
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						respect for autonomy,
					</li>
					<li>
						beneficence,
					</li>
					<li>
						nonmaleficence and
					</li>
					<li>
						justice
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					Attempts  have been made to bring people from different cultures together to develop  these principles and use them for decision making These principles - plus  attention to their scope (i.e. how and to whom they apply) - can provide the  basis for a rigorous consideration and resolution of ethical dilemmas. Although  they do not provide "rules", these principles can help public health workers  make decisions when moral issues arise. In effect they make a common set of  moral commitments, a common moral language, and a common set of moral issues  more visible and more accessible <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gillon R. (1994), Medical ethics: four principles plus attention to scope. BMJ 309, 184-8." id="9">(9)</a>. These principles are considered to be  prima facie: they are binding unless they conflict with other moral principles.  They are outlined briefly below:
			  </p>
				<h5>Autonomy</h5>
				<p>
					Autonomy, "self rule", although perceived differently in different  cultures, is an attribute of all moral agents. Autonomy gives one the ability  to make decisions on the basis of deliberation. Autonomy is also reciprocal: we  have a moral obligation to respect the autonomy of others as long as it is  compatible with equal respect for the autonomy of all those potentially  affected. According to the Western philosopher Immanuel Kant, respect for  autonomy means 'treating others as ends in themselves and never merely as  means' to some (externally defined) end <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gillon R. (1994), Medical ethics: four principles plus attention to scope. BMJ 309, 184-8." id="9">(9)</a>.
			  </p>
				<h5>Beneficence and non-maleficence</h5>
				<p>
					There is always a need to balance the effort to help and the risk of  causing harm. The traditional Hippocratic moral obligation of medicine is to  provide beneficence with non maleficence: net medical benefit to patients with  minimal harm.
				</p>
				<p>
					'Empowerment' in health care enabling people to be more in control of their  health - is a concept which has gained much popularity in recent years.  Empowerment means combining beneficence and respect for autonomy, whereby  autonomy is both respected and enhanced <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gillon R. (1994), Medical ethics: four principles plus attention to scope. BMJ 309, 184-8." id="9">(9)</a>.
			  </p>
				<h5>Justice</h5>
				<p>
					Justice refers to the moral obligation to act on the basis of fair  adjudication between competing claims. Equality is at the heart of justice, but  as Aristotle argued, justice is more than mere equality - people can be treated  unjustly even if they are treated equally <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Aristotle (1941). Nichomachean ethics, in 'The basic works of Aristotle Book 5' ( R. McKeon) Random House, New York." id="1">(1)</a>. Justice and equity can be seen  as synonymous, meaning in formal terms 'to each his or her due' <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Veatch R. 1994. Health care rationing through Global Budgeting: the ethical choices. J of Clinical Ethics 1994; 5(4): 291-296." id="29">(29)</a>. Both  equity and justice imply that everyone should have an opportunity to attain his  or her full potential for health.
			  </p>
				<p>
					These principles can be applied to tuberculosis control and the DOTS strategy.  When combined with the concept of public health, they provide a perspective  which allows us to weigh up the roles of the different actors involved, and to  focus on concepts of interdependence, respect and relationship between these  actors, persons with TB and the communities in which they live.
				</p>
				<h5>Tuberculosis control: DOTS</h5>
				<p>
					The main elements of WHO's DOTS strategy are: government commitment to  a national programme; case detection through 'passive' case finding (sputum smear  microscopy for pulmonary tuberculosis suspects); short course chemotherapy for  all smear positive pulmonary TB cases (under direct observation for at least  the initial phase of treatment); regular, uninterrupted supply of all essential  anti-TB drugs; and a monitoring system for programme supervision and  evaluation <a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO 1994. WHO/TB/94.179." id="32">(32</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Harries AD, Maher 1996. TB/HIV. A clinical manual. WHO/TB/96.200" id="11">11)</a>. The strategy has been created from a biomedical  perspective and therefore concentrates on treating disease rather than on  'providing the conditions in which people can be healthy'. Both perspectives  are important and valid, both can be incorporated into a more ethical approach  to TB control.
			  </p>
				<p>
					In addition to addressing technical requirements, tuberculosis control  strategies for the future will look at community health needs and how and where  TB fits into local health priorities. If also involved in the creation of  'healthy communities', TB control programmes will increasingly encompass issues  which are wider than the biomedical perspective and will include  interdisciplinary involvement in decision making as well as intersectoral  collaboration.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics of DOTS strategy</h4>
				<p>
					Each element of the DOTS strategy presents ethical and public health  dilemmas which, whether consciously in the minds of the protagonists or not,  feature in the DOTS debate in India. It is hoped that elucidation of these  issues can instigate a process of discussion by which they can be resolved to  the ultimate benefit of those affected by TB in India.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h5>Government commitment to a national TB programme</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						History  has shown that disease control programmes lacking in governmental support are  not sustainable. Indeed this has been the fate of a number of tuberculosis  programmes where they have had to compete with higher priority vertical  programmes (such as Family Planning in Asia). The converse also appears to be  true: those programmes receiving full government support and sanction have met  with impressive successes (e.g. smallpox and Family Planning). Yet the fact  remains that tuberculosis is only one contributor to ill health amongst  Indians. Although the national figures are daunting, with some analysts  suggesting that as many as 4 million Indians are affected, many believe that  before TB can be tackled there needs to be a stronger commitment to health  itself both within national governments and within the international arena.  Although there has been increasing attention to the links between poverty and  health, and despite information on health inequalities world-wide,  preservation of health is slipping down the priority lists of government  expenditure. For example, a Save the Children report shows that each year  Tanzania spends $105.3 per person on defence but only $0.7 on health; in Zaire  it is $9.7 and $0.4 respectively <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lancet Editorial 1996. Is health a moral responsibility? Lancet 347: 1197." id="16">(16)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						And thus we return to the New Public Health imperatives of 'the production of  health' and the 'creation of healthy communities'. A single-stranded  government commitment to a national tuberculosis programme may, if that  programme is structured vertically (thus being independent from the  consequently under-resourced health service), make some in-roads in tackling  the prevalence of tuberculosis in India. Yet if it does so at the expense of  the felt needs of the community and at the expense of a stronger, safer and  more humane public health service, then it will have failed as a public health  measure.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Case detection through 'passive' case finding (sputum smear microscopy  for pulmonary tuberculosis suspects presenting at a health facility).</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The  term 'case finding' takes cognisance of the fact that there are unknown cases  in a community who may not present to the health sector, or who may not be  identified when they do present <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Broekmans J. 1994. Control strategies and programme management. In JDH. Porter and KPWJ. McAdam, Eds. Tuberculosis: Back to the future. John Wiley &amp; Sons: Chichester." id="6">(6)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Active v/s passive : Differences between active and passive case finding  approaches, and problems with the effectiveness of passive case finding, have  been evident throughout the history of the NTP in India. In the 1960s the  strongly held belief was that<em>"... the extension in the work and aim of a clinic must not take  place until and unless the clinic or the service is able to deal adequately  with patients that report to it with symptoms ...</em>" <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Raj Narain. 1966. Case finding. Ind J Tub, 12 : 95." id="24">(24)</a>. This belief is  reflected in WHO's DOTS strategy. From this perspective more damage than good  can be done by actively bringing patients into a programme which cannot  adequately meet their needs - either for correct diagnosis or for drugs. There  is also the belief that active case finding leads to over-diagnosis, over- treatment, and therefore wastage and unnecessary burdens being placed on an  already over-burdened system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In essence passive case detection relies on people presenting to health  facilities for TB treatment. It presupposes a community where people with TB  will be educated sufficiently to understand the symptoms of TB and will be able  to present for treatment. It also pre-supposes the accessibility and  availability of a health care facility providing TB treatment and that people  with tuberculosis symptoms are autonomous agents.
					</p>
					<h6>Access:</h6>
					<p>
						Over  the past decade AIDS research has made important contributions to our  understanding of the relationship between illness, infectious disease and  social structures <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Parker RG 1996. Empowerment, community mobilization and social change in the face of HIV/AIDS. AIDS 10 (suppl 3): S27-S31." id="20">(20)</a>. This research has demonstrated that not all people have  equal access to health care structures, and that the social meanings ascribed  to certain diseases also affect people unequally. In terms of ethics, this  means looking at the relative autonomy of people with TB within their  community, the balance between beneficence and nonmaleficence, the net gain for  being enrolled in the DOTS strategy, and finally whether they are treated  justly. In short, the opposition to passive case finding revolves around 1) the  belief that all people have the right to appropriate treatment and 2) the fear  that many of society's most vulnerable members will not receive treatment  unless actively supported by the system.
					</p>
					<h6>Social and cultural  burden:</h6>
					<p>
						In  addition to the effect cultural meanings have on treatment-seeking and,  therefore, passive case-finding, there is also evidence that broader social  structural factors may also have a role to play. While the burden of  tuberculosis has been well defined from the epidemiological perspective, there  have been surprisingly few attempts to define the social and economic burden of  TB <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rangan S &amp; Ogden J (Eds). 1997. Tuberculosis in India: a state-of- the-art review. DfID Health &amp; Population Office, Delhi." id="25">(25)</a>. Similarly, there are only a limited number of studies on the actual  costs or economic consequences of TB borne by families, communities, and  economies in the developing world <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Uplekar M, Rangan S 1996. Tackling TB: the search for solutions. The Foundation for Research in Community Health. Bombay." id="28">(28)</a>. Nevertheless it is apparent that not  all people are equally able to access health care structures <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Farmer P. 1997. Social Scientists and the new tuberculosis. Soc Sci Med, 44( 3): 347-358." id="8">(8)</a>.
					</p>
					<h6>Stigma</h6>
					<p>
						Stigma  is one aspect that needs to be taken into account when considering the ethics  of the passive case-finding approach. Tuberculosis carries a social stigma. It  is also a disease which often affects the most marginalised, most poor and most  vulnerable groups in communities, the very groups who tend to have the least  autonomy. Although it is clear that the effects of stigma on passive case  finding need to be better understood, there is evidence which indicates that it  will have an effect on delaying treatment-seeking and that it may  substantially constrain the ability of young people and women in particular to  seek and obtain care <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Uplekar M, Rangan S 1996. Tackling TB: the search for solutions. The Foundation for Research in Community Health. Bombay." id="28">(28)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Passive case-finding may well be sound in public health terms, and even in  macro-economic terms, but the ethical implications need to be taken into  consideration as well. Considered and well-informed debate should enable the  development of solutions which meet the needs of the system as well as the  needs of the patients and the communities in which they live.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Short course chemotherapy for all smear positive pulmonary TB cases  (under direct observation for, at least, the initial phase of treatment (DOT).</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The development of short course chemotherapy (SCC) has been an  important breakthrough in tuberculosis treatment. The drugs involved enable  patients to obtain cure for their disease in less than half the time of  standard regimens. As with many technological breakthroughs, however, there are  dangers involved. Unless carefully monitored these drugs can lead to the  development of resistant strains of mycobacteria and eventually to untreatable  disease in individuals. The fear of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis  (MDR-TB), together with the economic imperative to reduce hospital admissions  for TB, has led practitioners and policy makers to require those receiving SCC  to do so under the direct observation of a trained health care worker.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the seemingly sound reasoning on which it is based, this element of the  DOTS strategy has caused the most controversy. Within and outside India those  who express reservations about or oppose the requirement of direct observation  argue that there is insufficient evidence to support it. Detractors insist that  the assumptions behind the imperative that patients are essentially  untrustworthy and that they cannot be relied upon to complete their course of  treatment - have not been validated in populations where the majority of  patients are poor, but none-the-less 'ordinary' members of their communities.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a related theme it has been argued that the discourse of direct observation  is one of domination and control - of the health care worker over the patient <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ogden JA. In press. Adherence vs. Compliance: just a matter of language? The politics and poetics of public health. In JDH Porter &amp; J Grange, Eds. Tuberculosis - an interdisciplinary perspective. Imperial College Press, London." id="19">(19)</a>.  In ethical terms, it can be argued that the approach fails to respect the  autonomy of the person with TB. The 'care relationship' between patients and  providers should, in ethical terms, be characterised by a balance between the  autonomy of the TB patients and the beneficence/non-maleficence of the health  care worker and should lead to net benefit with minimal harm. If the health  worker attempts to force the patient into a type of treatment which they do not  understand or agree with, then the relationship becomes coercive.
					</p>
					<p>
						A person goes to a medical practitioner because he is sick and wants to get  well. The practitioner has access to technology and knowledge that the patient  needs. It is an inherently unequal relationship. Yet this relationship is also  the key relationship in health care. In tuberculosis control, the discipline of  ethics helps to frame this relationship in order to ensure that this inequality  is not abused. Indeed codes of conduct are an important part of ethics in  medicine. The stronger this relationship the more appropriate the care  provided. This relationship is destroyed if power is abused.
					</p>
					<p>
						Those opposing direct observation may feel that it threatens this very  important relationship. It is not that DOT is wrong. In fact, the direct  observation of treatment is a rational approach to the delivery of TB drugs.  The problem comes, however, with the abuse of power that is potentially  inherent in a relationship between a powerful medical worker and a sick  vulnerable patient.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Regular, uninterrupted supply of all essential anti-TB drugs</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						For  this to be achieved, questions need to be asked about the type of health care  system established in a country. Relating back to point number one, it asks  governments to be committed to dealing with tuberculosis and to ensuring an  appropriate management and distribution system for TB drugs. It is not simply  the uninterrupted supply of drugs that is important, however, it is also the  access to those drugs by the people who need them. This statement therefore  raises questions about access to services and equity.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the era of health sector reform, control programmes like tuberculosis, need  to be flexible in order to be able to shift with the changes occurring in the  overall health structure in countries. Three inter-related sets of reforms  have dominated the last ten to twenty years of health policy debates  internationally: financing reforms (e. g. user fees), provision reforms, and  prioritising public sector resource allocations using cost effectiveness  analysis <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gilson L (in press 1998). Re-addressing equity: the search for the holy grail? The importance of ethics processes. In 'Reforming Health Sectors' Editor Mills A. Wiley, London." id="10">(10)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ethical processes are critical in promoting equity. <em>'Equity-promoting action in the health sector  must put the needs and interests of the poorest and most vulnerable at their  heart, as the relatively worse health outcomes of this group in comparison with  other groups are most often a function of circumstances beyond their control'</em> <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gilson L (in press 1998).

WHO/TB/96.200" id="11">11)</a></h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						As with the other elements of the DOTS strategy, monitoring and  evaluation can either promote equity and efficiency or seriously detract from  it. It is important, for example, that health care workers are able to perform  the tasks they are being evaluated on: the criteria for evaluation need to be  realistic and appropriate for particular contexts and given the real  constraints faced on the ground. Recent operations research in India, for  example, indicate that targets set at the national and international level may  be placing stresses on health workers that do not promote the care of patients  <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lala Ram Swarup Institute of Tuberculosis and Allied Diseases.

DfID Health &amp; Population Office, Delhi." id="15">(15)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Questions that need to be asked in relation to monitoring and evaluation  include: Is the system just and equitable? Does the system respect both the TB  patients and the health care workers that care for them? Does the system  encourage health care workers to identify problems or does it penalise them for  'not doing it right? Problems need to be identified and dealt with positively. This is the art of making difficult problems soluble, a process which Medawar  called the 'art of the soluble' <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medawar P. In Plato's Republic Incorporating the 'Art of the Soluble'. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1984." id="18">(18)</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						After  all it is through tackling problems that we find a process of engagement and  integration between people with TB, their communities, districts, states,  government and the international community <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pronyk P, Porter JDH. In press. Public Health and Human Rights. The ethics of international public health interventions for tuberculosis. In JDH Porter and J Grange, Eds. Tuberculosis - an interdisciplinary perspective. Imperial College Press London." id="23">(23)</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						DOTS makes sense scientifically, but if the emphasis is on targets rather than  the process developed to achieve these targets, then health care workers and  patients may be used as 'means' to achieving a particular 'end': they may be  abused. A system needs to be established in which both patients and providers  are respected. The health service is, after all, there to provide a service for  patients. A danger of having inappropriate targets for the health care worker  is that they will focus on attaining these targets rather than on caring for  the patient. This may lead to coercion by the health worker of the patient, or  to the exclusion of the patient from the system. Targets need to be adapted to  the local community situation and made appropriate to them.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Ethics is at the core of public health. Values are at the core of  community life. Looking at values, dilemmas and the conflicts that ensue  provides a way for communities to tackle health problems like tuberculosis.  This work helps to expand perspectives and leads to interaction with people  working in other disciplines as well as sectors outside health. It encourages  public health professionals to ask whether disease control strategies like DOTS  should encourage rights and empowerment of communities rather than control or  exclusion. Should they be about the eradication of disease or about the  production of health?
				</p>
				<p>
					Globalization and health sector reform are moving those of us working on  tuberculosis control to an increased understanding of the importance of a more  flexible approach to TB control which encourages the active participation and  creativity of communities. In infectious disease control, there is a debate  which centres around conflicting notions that frame the design of programmes:  one informed by bio-medical values and the other by socio-political values.  The former tends to reflect programmes in terms of outcomes, numbers of cases  treated and cures, following standardised procedures and assuming  generalisability; and the latter tends to see TB as a disease of poverty, but  which cannot wait for economic development to change that situation, and so  reflects programmes which take account of patients' living and working  conditions, which are flexible, accessible and try to deal with treatment  regimes as well as the stigmatising effects of the disease <a class="reference" href="#thirty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Walt G. In press. The politics of TB: the roel fo process and power. In JDH Porter and J Grange (Eds). Tuberculosis - an interdisciplinary perspective. Imperial College Press, London." id="30">(30)</a>. A bridge needs  to be created to bring these two dichotomous positions together and the process  to do this rests on the interaction between the TB control structures and the  communities with TB patients. From the ethical perspective, the bridge will be  constructed in the process of developing relationships between these different  groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through the discipline of ethics, it is possible to change perception, to shift  awareness and to find different, new, and creative ways of tackling large  public health problems. Engaging in the ethical debate, however, is difficult  because ethics forces us to look at the other side of the dilemma and to find  ways forward which incorporate all sides of the argument. A core part of ethics  is 'learning to live together'; it is to do with finding new relationships and  ways of interacting with people and with communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics needs to be put into action. Mere philosophical discussion is not enough  . The ethical framework provides a perspective to help us to change and we take  from ethics what is needed to make these changes: flexibility, utility, equity,  creativity of community, respect, and relationship.
