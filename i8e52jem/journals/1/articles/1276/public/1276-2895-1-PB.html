					The murder of Dr Vasant  Jaykar <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Express News Service: Cardiologist shot dead in Khar. Indian Express, Mumbai, January 12, 2001." id="1">(1)</a>, a well-known cardiologist practising in private hospitals in  Mumbai, created panic among the city's medical practitioners. This was  understandable because Dr Jaykar's murder was 'commissioned' by the aggrieved  brother of a patient who died while under the doctor's treatment <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Express News Service: Doctors upset by trend of violence.

					The reactions of  individual doctors and their organisations <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Express News Service: Doctors upset by trend of violence. Indian Express, Mumbai, January 17, 2001." id="2">(2)</a> have had certain common themes:  the practice of medicine has become a dangerous occupation; patients have  unreasonable expectations; they should understand that medicine is imperfect  and incomplete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such reactions were  expressed by professional organisations when the Consumer Protection Act was  made applicable to the medical profession, in 1993. They are repeated after  every publicised doctor-patient dispute. However, there has been no rational  analysis of the situation by medical professionals; knee-jerk reactions  dominate.
				</p>

				<h4>The failure of self regulation</h4>
				<p>
					The practice of medicine  has always been guided by self regulation, whose use differentiates a  profession from commerce. Profit is a secondary motive in a profession, while  it is the primary motive in commerce. Statutory bodies performing this  self-regulatory function therefore play a crucial role in maintaining the  profession's integrity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Medical Council of  India (MCI) and its state chapters were constituted to maintain ethical  standards and to enable self regulation in the medical profession. However,  over the last few decades, these statutory bodies have become dens of corruption  and opportunism for medical politicians. As medical education became  commercialised, the alliance between corrupt medical council members and  politician owners of capitation fee-based private medical colleges  destroyed the profession's ethical fabric.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this downslide in  self-regulation came the transformation of the doctor-patient relationship,  based on trust, into a comercial transaction. Dialogue between doctor and  patient, central to any successful therapy, became rare. Compassion, competence  and confidence, the profession's three pillars, were replaced by a single  pillar: Cash.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Technology gone wild</h4>
				<p>
					Other elements over the  last two decades have contributed to this change. The advent of medical  technologies providing better treatment outcomes for various diseases has  hastened the commercialisation of medicine. Technology is beneficial if used by  a trained and qualified person and for the proper indications. In India, it is  used more as a commercial venture than as an investigative or therapeutic tool,  marketed as panacea for every pathology, without infrastructural backup,  optimum monitoring or training. Patients are rarely informed of the costs and  of alternative, non-technological modes of treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					These aggressive  marketing methods have increased society's expectations, creating a belief in  the average patient's mind that everything can be cured or controlled. As a  result, both society and the medical profession forget that medicine is not  always an exact science.
				</p>
				<p>
					These trends have also  increased the cost of health care. The commercial concept of 'value for money'  has taken root in the health services. When the patient's increasing  expectations are not fulfilled in spite of spending huge amounts for  technological treatments, the doctor-patient relationship which is already  under strain breaks down, leading to disputes. In a violence-prone environment,  such disputes can take a violent turn. Dr Jaykar's murder is not the only  instance of a physical assault on a doctor.
				</p>

				<h4>The need for communication skills</h4>
				<p>
					The doctor-patient  relationship is based on trust, nurtured by communication and ethical medical  practice. The increasing use of technology, commercialisation, and declining  ethical standards in the profession have made this communication difficult if  not impossible. Consumer health organisations in India have found that the  majority of medico-legal complaints result from communication failure. However,  communication skills do not find a place in our medical curriculum, and only  one medical college includes medical ethics in its curriculum <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran GD et al. Teaching medical ethics: a model. Natl Med J India 1997; 10: 288-89." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the same time,  society sees no evidence that the profession takes action on complaints.  The MCI's president's investigation has not stopped him from being  installed as national president of the Indian Medical Association <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sharma D. Medical body chief under cloud of suspicion in India. Lancet 2000; 356: 573-6" id="4">(4)</a>. Such  actions send negative signals to the patient community about the medical  profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					It does not help the  profession's cause that it has taken little initiative to improve the abymsal  quality of our health care infrastructure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, it is necessary  to emphasise that in society, doctors practising ethically get little support.  "Costly treatment is good treatment," is a dangerous equation which  seems to have taken root in society. This is manifested in the demands for  expensive medicines and treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Jayakar's murder must  be condemned. However, it is symptomatic of the many problems in our ailing  healthcare services. Without a rational analysis of these problems, by the  medical profession and by society at large, the present chaos will only  degenerate into anarchy.
