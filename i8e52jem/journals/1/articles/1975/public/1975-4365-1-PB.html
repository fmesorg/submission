				<h4>Advertisement of consumer goods</h4>
				<p>
					It is disturbing to see that some professional organisations allow themselves to be made party to advertisement of consumer health products.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, it was the medical technologists who were said to have certified a toilet soap for its anti- bacterial properties. Now it is the Indian Dental Association who has blessed a tooth- paste. I fear that other bodies of health professionals will follow.
				</p>
				<p>
					The task of certifying products is best left to statutory bodies such as the Indian Bureau of Standards or our national committee for standardising the pharmacopeia.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any new discovery, innovation or invention should be published in an appropriate technical journal from which the manufacturer may quote in the leaflet on the product sent to the professional user.
				</p>
				<p>
					Professional associations should refrain from certifying products. Such an act is not only unethical but raises the suspicion of vested interest.
