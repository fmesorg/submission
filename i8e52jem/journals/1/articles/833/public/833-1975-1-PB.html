					Electroconvulsive  therapy (ECT) is an important treatment in psychiatry; despite the myth that it  is a barbaric and outdated practice <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Rao NSK. Medical students' attitudes towards electroconvulsive therapy. Convulsive Ther 1996; 12: 86-90." id="1">(1)</a>, it is as relevant today as it was over  six decades ago, when it was first introduced. This is because ECT can be life-saving  in catatonic, suicidal, or otherwise highly disturbed patients <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Electroconvulsive therapy. In: Bhugra D (ed): Handbook of Psychiatry. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002 (in press)." id="2">(2)</a>; because it  is of exceptional benefit in patients with psychotic depression <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petrides G, Fink M, Husain MM, Knapp RG, Rush AJ, Mueller M et al. ECT remission rates in psychotic versus nonpsychotic depressed patients: a report from CORE.

					During ECT, a  small electrical current (0.5-0.8 A) is passed through the brain via electrodes  applied to the scalp. The current stimulates the brain and elicits a  generalised seizure. This has two elements: the central seizure, manifested as  characteristic EEG activity, and the peripheral seizure, or convulsion <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Electroconvulsive therapy. In: Bhugra D (ed): Handbook of Psychiatry. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002 (in press)." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The exact  mechanism of action of ECT is not known for certain; however, it is definitely  known that, in the absence of the central seizure, electrical currents applied  to the brain are therapeutically ineffective <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. The mechanism of action of ECT. In: Gangadhar BN (Ed.): Proceedings of the National Workshop on ECT: Priorities for Research and Practice in India, pp 107-130. Bangalore: NIMHANS, 1992." id="5">(5)</a>. It has further been  established that, as long as the electrical activity in the brain which  corresponds to the seizure is allowed to develop, the peripheral seizure is  unnecessary <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Electroconvulsive therapy. In: Bhugra D (ed): Handbook of Psychiatry. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002 (in press)." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C.

					Why would  psychiatrists want to abolish the peripheral seizure? For one, the convulsion  looks frightening to the viewer; this perpetrates the myth that ECT is a  barbaric treatment <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Rao NSK. Medical students' attitudes towards electroconvulsive therapy. Convulsive Ther 1996; 12: 86-90." id="1">(1)</a>. More importantly, research conducted during the early  decades of ECT suggested that the convulsion is associated with a 20-40% risk  of subclinical compression fractures of middle thoracic vertebrae. The risk was  observed to be greater in males, in older subjects, and in those with  osteoporosis <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dewald PA, Margolis NM, Weiner H. Vertebral fractures as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy.

Although such fractures did not appear to be clinically  significant <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dewald PA, Margolis NM, Weiner H. Vertebral fractures as a complication of electroconvulsive therapy. Journal of the American Medical Association 1954; 154: 981-984." id="6">(6</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Polatin P, Linn L. Orthopedic and neurologic follow-up study of vertebral fractures in shock therapy. American Journal of Psychiatry 1949; 105: 824-827." id="9">9)</a>, it was nonetheless considered that morbidity avoided is  safety promoted.
				</p>
				<p>
					While muscle relaxation  during ECT had been attempted as early as in 1940, it was not until 1953 that  succinylcholine was established as a suitable agent for peripheral muscle  relaxation during ECT <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Electroconvulsive therapy. In: Bhugra D (ed): Handbook of Psychiatry. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002 (in press)." id="2">(2)</a>. With the use of succinylcholine, the peripheral  seizure is abolished, and the musculoskeletal complications of ECT are  minimised. Such administration of a muscle relaxant is known as modification of  the ECT procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this stage, it is  worth noting that unmodified ECT is, rarely, associated with other risks, such  as dislocation of various joints, minor muscle or ligament tears, cardiac  arrhythmias, aspiration of secretions into the respiratory tract, haemorrhage  at various sites, and anxiety <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pitts FN Jr. Medical physiology of ECT. In: Abrams R, Essman WB (eds): Electroconvulsive therapy: Biological Foundations and Clinical Applications. Lancaster: MTP Press Ltd, 1982, 57-89." id="10">(10)</a>. The prevalence of such complications with  unmodified ECT is very low, and precise prevalences are unknown.
				</p>
				<p>
					The administration of  succinylcholine to a conscious patient, immediately before ECT, is frightening  because succinylcholine paralyses all voluntary muscles, including those of  respiration. It is therefore necessary to administer anaesthesia before ECT;  however, the administration of anaesthesia is associated with its own risk,  making the presence of an anaesthesiologist necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is where  practitioners of ECT in India find themselves in a bind: one the one hand,  their experience is that unmodified ECT is associated with virtually no risks  to the patient; on the other hand, they find that anaesthesia cannot be administered  safely to many categories of patients, and the presence of an anaesthesiologist  cannot always be assured.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is difficult to  recruit anaesthesiologists in many parts of the country because these  specialists are few and are monopolised by surgeons. Furthermore, involving  anaesthesiologists raises the expenses of ECT from a negligible sum to a high,  and (to many) hard-to-afford sum. Some, but not all Indian practitioners  therefore continue to administer unmodified ECT. A survey of the medical membership  of the Indian psychiatry found that, in 1991, only 44.2% of practitioners who  administered ECT always administered modified treatments; however, only 24.2%  invariably administered unmodified ECT <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Agarwal AK, Reddy MV. The practice of ECT in India. 2. The practical administration of ECT. Indian J Psychiatry 1993; 35: 81-86." id="11">(11)</a>. More recent data are unavailable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether unmodified ECT  is ethical or not depends upon a risk- benefit analysis. On the one hand,  modified ECT reduces musculoskeletal risks, haemorrhage at various sites,  pre-ECT anxiety, and the other but rare adverse effects of unmodified ECT that  were listed earlier. On the other hand, modified ECT could be beyond the means  (or the reach) of a large segment of Indian society, and introduces the risks  associated with anaesthesia.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is now further  evidence upon which decision-making can be based. Tharyan et al <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experience. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="12">(12)</a> observed  from a chart review that only 12 patients experienced fractures with unmodified  ECT in a series of 1,835 patients who received a total of 13,597 ECT treatments  across a span of 11 years. And, we found that only 1 of 50 patients experienced  an adverse musculoskeletal event with unmodified ECT in a systematic,  radiological investigation of the adverse effects of the procedure <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Rele K, Sutharshan R, Shah N. Musculoskeletal morbidity with unmodified ECT may be less than earlier believed. Indian J Psychiatry 2000; 42: 156-162." id="13">(13)</a>. It  therefore appears prudent to conclude that while modified ECT may be the ideal,  there can be situations in which unmodified ECT may be preferable to no ECT.  Examples of such situations are those in which ECT is strongly indicated but  anaesthesiological facilities are unavailable or unaffordable; in such  situations, the expected gains with ECT are likely to far exceed the risks with  unmodified treatments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The stage is now set for  a systematic audit of modified as well as unmodified ECT so that better data  may be made available upon which more valid decision-making can be based.
