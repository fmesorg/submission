					The  dilemmas presented by Mr Rajan Patil, although not new, are difficult to  resolve with straightforward answers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  account reminded me of similar communities with whom I have interacted. For  example, among some Aboriginal Canadians, traditionally hunter-gatherers, the  chief was identified as the one most capable of assuring the tribe's  survival&mdash;by his skills and his ability to discern and accommodate the spirits  prevailing in a given situation or time. With the arrival of the Europeans and  the consequent impact on resources, the chief became the person most capable of  'playing the game'. This could mean corruption of the principles guiding the  choice of a chief.
				</p>
				<p>
					How  leaders are chosen, and who they represent is not clear in many societies even  today. In such situations, would it be judicious to take the community leader's  approval as representative of the community?
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr  Patil asks: Is it ethical to tamper with the value system of a tribal  community? The question could be rephrased as: Is it permissible to allow  anyone to engage in destructive behaviour just because they think that such  behaviour is normal? Some cultures tolerate child and spousal abuse. Is this  acceptable just because it is cultural? Care must be taken to guarantee the  integrity of the research and to be sensitive to the dynamics of the local  culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using  only the standard of individual consent poses risks for participating  individuals. It would be interesting to know how the tribe responds to a member  who goes against the leader's direction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Researchers  must be clear about the goals, values and standards that govern any group or  effort. Violation of community norms, by seeking individual consent while  sidelining the community leader, might subject individuals to retribution of a  kind that researchers might not foresee. Unwillingness to bear such  responsibilities may pose problems with community-based research. Further,  research without an intervention or follow-up plans gives the participants no  opportunity to contact the researchers, should the need arise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research  of this type will inevitably come across people needing health care. Is it  ethical for researchers to design a project without tangible benefits, such as  improved health care access, to research participants or the community?  Aboriginal Canadians have frequently told me, 'We have been researched enough!'
				</p>
				<p>
					Inducements  may not be ideal and have their own pitfalls, but do they compromise the  research? Should people be deprived of life-saving health care because giving  it in the research context might be seen as an inducement? Clinical trials  worth millions of dollars were stopped halfway when the trial drug performed  well; it was unethical to deprive the control group of the more effective drug.  People's lives are more important than additional knowledge that might be  gained by continuing the trial. Therefore, health care provision must be built  into the research budget, not added later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  issue is that of 'maintaining privacy' during interviews with research  participants. The public manner in which the research team worked resonates  with the traditional functioning of Canadian Aboriginals. The use of the  'talking circle' and the 'talking stick' is essential to tribal decisions and  reflects their appreciation of public action with everyone having a say.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally,  one should consider whether exceptions to research guidelines should be  anticipated, discussed and decided upon before the work starts, or whether they  can be decided on the spot. The case study does not indicate that preliminary  discussions took place. The statement that community consent would mean  'phenomenal time saving' raises doubts about the researcher's understanding of  principles of research ethics.
