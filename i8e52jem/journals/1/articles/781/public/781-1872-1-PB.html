  <h4>John Grisham. The king of torts. Mumbai: Arrow Books, Random  House Group Ltd, 2003. Rs 225, pp376. ISBN 0-09-941617&ndash;4</h4>
  <p>Clay  Carter, a lawyer who holds a none-too-well paying job, that of defending an  indigent in the office of the public prosecutor, is asked to defend a teenager  who has committed a murder. What initially appears to be a fairly simple, open  and shut case of one street junkie killing another, turns out to be a case of  murder without a motive. Why would a criminal, who has never gone beyond petty  shoplifting, suddenly murder a person, and that too, while on a de-addiction  programme? A bit of investigation reveals that these de-addiction centres have  more such cases and are trying to hide some facts. When Carter is at this stage  of the investigation, a representative of a major pharmaceutical company  approaches him and makes an astounding proposition. This man, Max Pace&nbsp; as  he calls himself, is a fire-fighter, one who solves a problem before it flares  up. In this case, it involves a drug major that experimented with a  de-addiction pill called Tarvan without following the necessary protocols. The  drug succeeds in de-addicting a considerable proportion of patients, a figure  high enough to become a major selling point in the pharma market. There is,  however, a major side-effect, one that will bury the drug&mdash;and the potential  profits&mdash;entirely. Max Pace swings into action and... I shall not spoil the  interest in the book for future readers by revealing more of the plot.</p>
  <p>The  stakes in this episode and in the rest of the book are so huge that the  lawyer's conscience is quickly buried and the unfolding story is one of the  meteoric rise of Clay Carter and what follows. To add spice to the intrigue is  a romance that has twists and turns as the story progresses.</p>
  <p>There  are some lessons here for doctors who are ever ready to prescribe any drug  without reading the fine print. Avaricious drug companies may market drugs  without proper safeguards, push clinical trials and hide facts. An established  drug in the market, such as the one mentioned in this book causes tumours&mdash;a  fact that may have drawn the attention of the medical community. The question  that arises is: why did the medical profession not complain? The author makes a  pertinent comment: 'doctors and pharmaceutical companies sleep together!' The  other reason is that undesirable side-effects are seen by doctors only rarely,  whereas if one takes the population as a whole these side effects form a  sizeable proportion and tort lawyers are experts in harnessing these numbers.  Imagine a scenario wherein 500 patients suffer a untoward disabling side-effect  and the drug company that wants to settle with them pays a compensation of one  million dollars each. The total 'cut' the lawyer representing all of them would  get would be colossal compared to one person fighting the case for which he may  not have the wherewithal to do so. This is what mass action is all about.</p>
  <p>What  makes the novel attractive to a medical reader is that it so very possible in  real life. Indeed, perhaps it is happening in Third World countries. I refer to  the ongoing cisapride story, which I wrote about in 2000 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao BC. Withdrawing drugs: Need for global uniformity. Natl Med J India 2000;13:165." id="1">(1)</a> as well as its  variations <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pai, SA, Lakshmi PK, Rao BC, Sahni P. Pharmaceutical companies and the third world [Correspondence]. Lancet 2003;361:1136." id="2">(2)</a>. With poor laws and ineffective machinery to enforce them, it is  conceivable that major pharma companies might try out their experimental drugs  on our population as Ackerman did with their anti-addiction drug Tarvan in the  far East initially, and then with poor African-American patients in  rehabilitation homes in the US.</p>
  <p>This is  the usual John Grisham story-eminently readable, but with a message to all of  us. 'Think twice before prescribing, and prescribe only if it is based on  evidence.'</p>
