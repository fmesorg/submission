				<h4>Some questions</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Would it have been acceptable to go ahead with the surgery without informing Dr X?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					No. When Dr. X is in possession of his senses, he has to be consulted and his decision honoured.
				</p>
            <p>
					<strong>Would it have been okay if the tumour was believed to have affected the patient's ability to understand the situation?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes. When he is not in full possession of his senses, his next of kin must decide in his best interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Would it have been okay if the chances of recovery following surgery were low?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					No. If the chances of recovery were low, the decision on whether or not to operate must be taken even more carefully and the patient's choice ascertained.
