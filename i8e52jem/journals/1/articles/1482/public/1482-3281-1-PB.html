<p> <strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>0n January 19, 1999, the Philippine Supreme Court lifted the temporary restraining order on the execution of Leo Echegaray issued hours before Mr Echegaray was to be executed.</p>
<p>Appeals are urgently requested from health professionals.</p>
<p>The death penalty is a violation of the right to life as guaranteed in many international human rights standards, including Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It carries a risk of irreversible judicial error, heightened by credible reports of the use of torture to extract confessions in the Philippines. Executions themselves are inhumane, and not rendered humane by the use of lethal injection as execution method. President Estrada is urged to commute the death sentence passed on Leo Echegaray</p>
