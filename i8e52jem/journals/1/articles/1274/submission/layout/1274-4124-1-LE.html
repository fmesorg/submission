				<p>
					As can be seen from our annual reports published on the
					back cover of IME, we believe in sharing with our readers
					the financial status of the organisation, not merely as an
					exercise in transparency but more importantly because we
					believe all our readers to be partners in our endeavour
					towards the cause of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of the financial year 1999-2000, there were
					many indications of our insecure financial and
					organisational status. Our subscription base had fallen
					sharply, and we presume that this is at least partly due to
					our poor follow-up in the previous year for renewals. At the
					same time, our production costs had risen, as had our
					postage costs. Overall, we have relied on honorary work,
					such as that of our auditors, M/S Sachin Mulgaokar and
					Co. Such gestures instill in us the confidence that our work
					is appreciated not just by our medical colleagues but also
					by individuals from other professions as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					For day-to-day activities, we continue to fall back on
					voluntarism. All the editorial work for the journal is
					voluntary. Many of our editorial board also put in hours for
					other administrative work in the Society. This can become
					particularly difficult due to the nature of professional
					practice. The administration had thus suffered significantly
					during the year. To correct this partially, we had recruited
					part-time help (at Rs.2500 per month) in administration and
					accounts for the past year (1999-2000).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the current year, the Foundation for Medical Ethics
					Society has entered into a collaborative project with the
					Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes, to
					popularise medical ethics. CEHAT spent Rs 50,000 to
					support 576 gift subscriptions to people and institutions
					identified by the editorial board of IME, as potential
					subscribers. We received about 60 new subscriptions as a
					result of these gift subscriptions. After a sharp dip in the
					subscription base the previous year, the present paid
					subscription base is approximately 450, with another 100
					life subscriptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need the support of at least 5,000 subscriptions just to
					break even with very modest budgeting, in order to ensure
					some stability. We are far away from this figure at the
					moment. As we had written last year, the struggle for stability
					is likely to be long drawn.
				</p>
				<p>
					We urge every subscriber and reader to help our effort through donations to the corpus. We also ask that you help increase the journal's readership by promoting subscriptions. We need your readership, support, funds, and, most important, your all-round participation in the debate on, and practice of, medical ethics.
