				<p>An analysis of a recent controversy which shook up the University of Mumbai</p>
                </div>

<div class="section">
				<p>
					<em>January 12, 1999:</em> According to the final MBBS  results declared by the University of Mumbai, over 300 students had failed in  the Preventive and Social medicine (PSM) paper. Out of these, 64 students had  failed only in PSM.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>January 25:</em> The university declared that it had granted eight grace marks  to all 1,100 students who had appeared for the examination. As a result, all 64  students passed this examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>February 2:</em> The Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) made a representation  to Dr Daulatrao Aher, Maharashtra's minister for health, saying that such  granting of grace marks was against the rules of the University.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>February 3:</em> The governor of Maharashtra, P C Alexander, asked the  university vice-chancellor, Dr Snehalata Deshmukh, to submit a report  explaining the university's action.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>February 4:</em> Dr Aher declared that the MMC was empowered to conduct an  inquiry according to Section 27A of the MMC Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>April 7:</em> The governor set aside the university's decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, in February, 61 of the 64 students had moved the Mumbai High Court  asking for re-evaluation of the papers. The court upheld the governor's  decision. According to the final results declared after re-evaluation, 19  students failed the PSM paper, the rest passed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main players in this drama were: a silent University Vice-Chancellor and  Dean of the medical faculty, a very active minister for health, an obstreperous  MMC and a governor nudged into action. Surprisingly, no one heard much from  either the affected students or the paper-setters and examiners of the PSM  paper. Students claim that the press refused to listen to their side of the  story and the paper setters said they were bound by government directions and  could not speak out until the judgement in which the high court upheld the  governor's decision, was passed. The Vice-Chancellor maintained all along that  the university acted within its rights when granting eight grace marks, and it  did so because the PSM paper was difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					The media held that the University gave eight grace marks to all the students  in order to ensure that two students (who had failed only in PSM) got  distinction in two other subjects. At stake were postgraduate seats in surgery  and gynecology (both branches very much in demand). Both the VC and students  refuted this claim.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Dr Seema Pai (one of the affected students), the review of PSM  results started with representations made by over 300 students who had failed  in the subject. A less complicated, if equally corrupt, 'solution' would be for  the two students to apply for re-evaluation and "settle the matter at the going  rate of the examiner". According to this theory supporting the VC, she did not  need to add these eight marks if her intention was to favor these two students.
				</p>
				<p>
					A little known fact is that the students had not asked for grace marks. Their  representation to the VC simply states that students could not attempt  questions worth 18 marks to the best of their capabilities as doctors, and that  the VC should look into the matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					The large number of failures in the PSM paper this year (unlike preceding  years) indicates a change in the standard of questions asked. There is also a  widespread perception that the average Indian doctor (especially the medical  student) lacks general knowledge. Senior medical teachers admit that the  occasional medical student who can hold forth on a subject outside the  prescribed textbooks is considered brilliant. This contradicts the reactions of  various lay readers and spectators of the PSM drama that "they too could have  attempted the so-called difficult PSM paper".
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the affected students maintains that they could well write short notes  on subjects such as Alcoholic Anonymous, barrier nursing, CRY and the efficacy  of the BCG vaccine, but from a layman's point of view. For a medical  perspective, such essays must be documented with references and statistics that  are not part of their textbook. However, a paper-setter maintains that AA may  not appear in the PSM textbook but is a topic in psychiatry, and barrier  nursing is an integral part of clinical practice. All the topics in the  examination paper are relevant, important and have been part of government  public education programmes.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to one of the paper-setters of the PSM paper, the paper could have  been perceived as difficult because the medical faculty often does not bother  to update itself in the issues concerned with its subject. <em>"As a result, important issues that are not  included in the text are not taught to students"</em> she says. The paper setter  also points out that the PSM faculty and deans of various medical colleges had  taken up the issue of collecting the signatures for the representation made to  the University by the 300 students who had failed in the subject. This conveys  that PSM teachers (excluding the paper setters of course) believed that the  paper had been difficult.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both teachers and students agree that the "PSM scandal" was actually a  political game played between people at the highest level, over issues and  enmities unconnected both with preventive and social medicine, and the  students.
