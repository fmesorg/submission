					Ever since the publication of David Werner's Where
					there is no doctor, one has yearned for a book
					addressing the situation: 'Where there is a doctor'.
					The growing evidence of avarice among clinical practitioners
					makes this need particularly acute, and the books under
					review are welcome. The fact that these are written by
					practising doctors is noteworthy. The first book looks at the
					current, dismal health-care scenario and lists some measures
					to cope with it. The second is a guide for patients to make
					intelligent use of medical care.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Trick or treat, the author takes the reader through a
					discussion of most issues related to the state of health care
					today &mdash; focusing on the rural scene &mdash; leading to the most
					important question of how to cope with the system. How to
					get... is meant for the urban patient, particularly the well-todo
					urban patient with access to computers and the internet.
					Reading these books together presents a picture of the larger
					canvas of the current health care scenario, with some useful
					advice on how to deal with it as a patient.

				<h4>Trick or treat</h4>
				<p>
					The book cover states that it is meant to make readers aware
					of the flaws in the system; for women to understand genderrelated
					risks in hospitals and how to avoid sexual harassment;
					for activists to learn to discuss the pros and cons of
					multifaceted heath care issues; for health professionals to
					see the current health crisis from a client's viewpoint and
					avoid litigation, and lastly for administrators to understand
					the complex nature of health-care-related problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book describes the current crisis in health care, and
					the resulting evidence of large-scale malpractice.
					Unnecessary surgery and laboratory investigations,
					glamour-based (as against necessary) medicine, the 'cut'
					practice, and quackery... Dr. Sethuraman pulls no punches
					in his exposition of the tricks that practitioners and medical
					institutions play on gullible patients. The book is written in
					an easy-to-understand, jargon-free style, and the
					accompanying cartoons make an impression. I found the
					repeated use of parables to illustrate the author's points
					unnecessary and sometimes jarring, but this is only my
					personal preference.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though none of the information is new to those in the
					healthcare industry, it will be important and useful to lay
					readers and consumers of health services, outlining
					worrisome trends in private and public health services which
					need to be addressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, the book misses out on the near complete absence
					regulation or governance from the medical councils, and the
					proliferation of substandard private medical colleges
					charging exorbitant capitation fees (charges that are passed
					on to the patient later). There is a passing reference to the
					Medical Council of India (MCI) but little discussion of the
					fact that medical councils' inaction is hurting the health care
					system.

				<h4>How to get the best medical care</h4>
				<p>
					The book states that it is 'a guide for the intelligent patient'.
					Also written in a simple style, it even gives "guidelines to
					understand the jargon" used in medical language. Almost
					every situation urban patients could encounter in a doctor's
					office or other medical service is explained. Putting this
					information into practice would make a 'champion' patient.
					No sarcasm should be read into this statement; patients
					who put to practice everything that Drs. Malpani
					advise would become truly empowered participants in their
					therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, some of the advice is difficult to put into practice.
					"As a patient, your responsibilities are wide and varied and
					you need to play several 'roles' at various times" These
					roles are: medical information researcher, medical team
					manager, treatment decision maker, medical record keeper,
					financial manager, and communicator. This is a tall order
					when most practitioners do not respect these 'roles' for the
					patient. But this may become possible if &mdash; with persistence
					and sobriety &mdash; patients force action in this direction, and
					particularly if many clinicians support the idea.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another example: "Today, ironically, it (foetal monitoring)
					is often used to justify a Caesarean section (CS) operation
					to forcibly take out the baby as determined by the foetal
					monitor! A much simpler alternative would be to opt for
					'kick counts', a procedure in which the mother simply keeps
					track of how often her baby moves in a given time period."
					This information can be an important tool for the pregnant
					woman but what will she do if her obstetrician insists on
					using the foetal monitor?
				</p>
				<p>
					There are suggestions to include clinical practitioners from
					all systems of medicine: "Diverse modalities such as Reiki,
					yoga, ayurveda, acupressure, hypnosis, homeopathy,
					naturopathy... can work .. as a part of a unified team rather
					than in competition," they tell us. Splendid idea in theory. In
					practice, it sounds idealistic at best.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both books rightly stress the place of a good general
					practitioner in health care. Unfortunately, this tribe is fast
					dwindling. Of those still there, many, it seems, have taken to
					getting 'cuts' on referring patients to specialists.
					Transparency in health care is constantly eroded. Under
					such circumstances, it is refreshing to see practising doctors
					speak up and support the patient's cause. Anyone interested
					in the welfare of end users in health care must read these
					books, and make use of them.
