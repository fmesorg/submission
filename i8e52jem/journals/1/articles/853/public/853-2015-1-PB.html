					The unravelling of the  entire genetic sequence of humans and, more recently, of important pathogens  such as the causative agents of tuberculosis and malaria are landmark events in  science. This is just a beginning in improving our understanding of biology and  disease. The tools and techniques for genomic research are costly and the full  benefits are not easy to quantify, nor is it easy to predict possible misuse of  this new information. Although Genomics as a science goes beyond genetic  disorders, genetic diseases are an important component. India can learn a lot  from its experience with genetic diseases, both in terms of our attempts  towards research in this area and efforts to care for patients with genetic  disorders. This may help guide our approach in the 'post-genomic era'. I will  outline some of the challenges that physicians in India may face, taking the  example of beta-thalassaemia, a relatively common genetic disorder.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical college  curricula offer little formal and structured training in medical genetics, and  there is inadequate exposure to modern molecular biology. Molecular  biology tools are essential for the management of genetic disorders and  research in this area. A good understanding of modern genetics and molecular  biology is essential for patient care providers to take the benefits of newer  advances to their patients. Trained genetic counsellors are few and, for  patients, access to educational material and genetic counselling is limited.  There are some excellent genetic laboratories in; however, with the exception  of a few in superspecialty hospitals, these are not attached to medical  centres. Access to patient material is difficult for laboratories not attached  to treatment centres. Having treatment and research facilities under the  same roof is of advantage to any researcher. Of the 180 or so medical schools  attached to some of the biggest hospitals in the country, there are barely  three or four departments of medical genetics within medical colleges. (AIIMS  in Delhi and St John's Medical College Hospital in Bangalore are two such  hospitals.) The reasons for such few genetics/molecular biology departments are  many, including the shortage of medical and paramedical staff in the face of an  incredible patient load. Overworked physicians barely have time for research,  and poor resources and lack of political will have both compounded this  inadequacy.
				</p>

					There is a need to have  more centres capable of genetic diagnosis for better prevention and treatment  of beta- thalassaemia and other genetic diseases. The Institute of  Immunohaematology in Mumbai is one such centre that has done important work in  defining the type of mutations in population groups, but more regional centres  are required in areas with higher prevalence of particular genetic diseases.

				<h4>Informed  consent</h4>
				<p>
					Patient confidence is a  major factor that limits many research studies. A patient is more likely to  volunteer to donate a specimen or to participate in a clinical trial on the  direct advice of their caregiver than that of an independent researcher. This  is especially true if the patient is confident that the researcher is concerned  about his well-being and the care provider has an inherent advantage in gaining  such confidence. The patient's informed consent is mandatory for participation  in any research study. For an informed consent to be truly informed,  researchers seeking to enroll a patient in a study must be knowledgeable of the  research tools and implications of the study. Physician who have been involved  in modern clinical research during their training period are likely to be  motivated in involving patients from their practice in such studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us consider  beta-thalassaemia, which is the most common monogenic disorder in India.  Of the population, 5% are carriers, carrying a mutation in a single beta globin  allele. An estimated 10,000 children are born with the defect each year. There  are an estimated 100,000 patients with mutations in both alleles which results  in beta-thalassaemia. While in terms of sheer numbers this disease pales in  comparison with infectious disease such as tuberculosis and the more recent  scourge of AIDS, the economic impact is serious. Optimum treatment of an  individual with beta-thalassaemia with repeated blood-transfusions and  chelation therapy costs about Rs 100,000/year. Unlike many genetic disorders,  there is a curative option for beta-thalassaemia-allogeneic bone marrow  transplantation. However, only about 25%-30% can find a suitable donor. Of such  patients only a small fraction can afford the procedure, which costs Rs 6-12  lakh.
				</p>

				<h4>Management</h4>
				<p>
					What about management of  the disease once it has been identified? Once a gene mutation for a genetic  disorder such as beta-thalaessemia is diagnosed in an individual, the disease  may be prevented in future generations by identifying carriers in that  individual's family, by genetic counselling and by measures such as prenatal  genetic testing. As mentioned above, cure by bone marrow transplantation is not  possible for most individuals. However, even individuals fortunate enough to  have families with both a suitable donor and the money for the procedure have  to contend with long waiting lists or forego the procedure, there being only a  few centres such as the Christian Medical College in Vellore with the required facilities  and expertise and success rates that match the best hospitals in the West.  Several other hospitals have acquired the capability for bone marrow  transplantation. However, it is estimated that no more than 100 allogeneic bone  marrow transplant procedures are carried out per year in the country. Bone  marrow transplantation is not the answer for all genetic disorders, but is an  example of a procedure for which capability exists within the country. It  highlights the fact that technology-intensive procedures are expensive, but  costs can be brought down and the success rate increased if done in sufficient  numbers.

				<h4>Research  and development</h4>
				<p>
					Research and development  (R&amp;D) in such diseases is critical for us to find better treatment options.  However, this needs to be done with the full realisation that such expensive  research will need adequate funds. Despite the high level of investment  required, it is all the more critical for us to now develop indigenous R&amp;D  capability because emerging intellectual property laws may make it more  expensive for us to use the information and technology generated overseas. If  we do not invest in research today, we may end up spending a lot more in the  future. The argument against developing advanced technology for the diagnosis,  therapy and research of genetic diseases is that these costly exercises divert  scarce resources and that there is not enough trained manpower to use such  technology. Further, it is questioned whether it is ethical to use expensive  technology when more prevalent diseases can be prevented by a fraction of the  cost of prenatal testing or even one marrow transplantation. There is also the  fear of unethical use of new technology, as has happened with prenatal sex  determination in some northern states.
				</p>
				<p>
					The argument in favour  of advanced technology is that only by introducing it can we develop the  capacity to understand and exploit it. One can adapt such technology to local  needs and develop, test and absorb newer advances with efficiency. If resources  do not allow the implementation of high technology in government-run hospitals,  the private sector should be encouraged to develop and offer such facilities.  Often, a great deal of effort is required to develop a technology-intensive  operation that is economically viable in the private sector. In the long run,  this effort can pay off. Such efforts should continue to be actively  supported and encouraged, not only by the government but also by informed  citizens. The benefits of new technology often spill over beyond what was  originally envisaged as it evolves. Consider a procedure such as bone marrow  transplantation; the indications for the procedure are many and it can benefit  conditions such as cancers and other genetic diseases. One may well ask, 'Is it  ethical not to exploit the benefits of advanced technology in healthcare and to  make it as widely available as possible?'

				<h4>Conclusion  and recommendations</h4>
				<p>
					To fully exploit the advantages  of the post-genomic era, we need to develop new technology while optimally  utilising existing technology. I recommend that there be designated  departments of genetics and/or molecular biology in at least one medical  college in each state/geographical region; this should be a government  priority. Greater efforts towards patient education and public information will  no doubt help to bring technology closer to the people and help them make full  and appropriate use of such developments. Patient support and advocacy groups  are such as the Spastics and Thalassaemia societies play an invaluable role in  such efforts. Lastly, agencies such as the Department of Biotechnology and the  Indian Council of Medical Research that are best qualified to evaluate the scientific  merit and determine societal priorities and ethical appropriateness of  projects, should be empowered to fund them. Not only is there a need for  these agencies to be better funded, the funding for approved projects should  match the goals of the project and the funding process should be streamlined.  Fortunately, in the past few years, both the Department of Biotechnology as  well as the Indian Council of Medical Research have had a more active role.  However, the resources that we make available remain a small fraction of what  western countries spend on medical research. Indeed, compared to China, our  expenditure in this area is miniscule. Hopefully, the momentum will not let up  and continued efforts will be commensurate with the challenges we face.
