				<h4>Experts group meeting</h4>
				<p>
					On February 22, 2003, the Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES) organised the  first experts group meeting in the YMCA, Mumbai Central, on a study that it has  undertaken on pharmaceutical promotion practices. This study, funded by the  World Health Organization through the Drugs Controller General of India, is for  a period of six months. It will use qualitative research methods to identify  promotional practices meant to influence the prescription, supply, purchase  and/or use of medicinal drugs. A group of expert resource people representing  industry, voluntary organisations, chemists' organisations, medical  representatives, the WHO, pharmacologists and researchers discussed the study  in detail and gave valuable suggestions on modifications. With this study, FMES  has branched out into a new activity&mdash;research on ethical issues of importance  in our society.

				<h4>National editorial board meeting</h4>
				<p>
					On February 22 and 23, 2003, the FMES held the first meeting of its national  editorial board which includes Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram, Pune and Wardha.  Those who were unable to make it were sorely missed as a host of important  issues were discussed. Besides being an opportunity for many FMES members in  Mumbai to meet after a long time, the meeting was also the first opportunity  for the group to meet the new editor and assistant editor in person. Among the  topics discussed were our current efforts to grow as an organisation both by  expanding our subscriber base and by taking on new activities. A status report  was given on the legal cases filed by FMES on the Maharahstra Medical Council  elections and future plans for this activity were discussed. FMES is also involved  in a campaign against communalism among medical professionals. Various efforts  to obtain funding were reported, and a discussion was held on whether funding  could influence the journal's editorial content. A brief account was given of  the journal's subscription trends. It was felt that the journal must reach  medical colleges and mainstream medical professionals. Plans were announced to  publish an anthology of the last 10 years of the journal. The new-look journal  was also discussed, and plans to restructure work for the journal so as to  distribute responsibility. Starting with the April 2003 issue, we have taken  the help of the Delhi-based editorial consultants Byword for the journal's  production. The meeting concluded with an assessment of the January issue and a  discussion of articles in future issues.
