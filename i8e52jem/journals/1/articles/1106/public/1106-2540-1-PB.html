				<h4>Problem  solvers for better health</h4>
				<p>
					The Second National Conference of Problem Solvers for Better Health (PSBH) held  in Thiruvananthapuram on December 15-16, 2003 was attended by around 150  students and 25 faculty members from more than 35 medical colleges. This global  movement coordinated by Health Action by People, a health non-governmental  organisation in India, aims to inculcate awareness about community needs in  medical students. At a two-day workshop, students identify a community need and  plan and conduct a study, helped by resource persons and their faculty. A few  attend the annual conference where they share their studies with their peers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  exercise encourages a questioning attitude in medical students, an aptitude for  grassroot research and a desire to know the community's problems. Projects  presented at the conference ranged from issues in environmental health, occupational  health and communicable diseases to bringing about changes in their  institutions. Most also highlighted the ethical aspects of their study.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  movement is progressing from its modest beginnings in Kerala and has reached  Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Tie-ups with community medicine  departments encourage students to adopt the problem-solving approach in the  rural communities where they are posted. A fixed amount of money paid to the  college per completed student project is used to acquire computers to help  students plan, document and analyse their findings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  revised Medical Council of India guidelines require students to do a research  project during their MBBS. The PSBH process offers such an opportunity.
