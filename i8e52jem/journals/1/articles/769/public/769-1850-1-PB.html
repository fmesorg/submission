					Dr  Mohanan Nair's paper <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nair M. Medical college teachers and some ethical issues in Kerala. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:116-17." id="1">(1)</a> was an unpleasant but a more or less factual reminder  of the state of affairs in the medical colleges of Kerala. It might benefit  from a historical perspective and a comparative assessment with other medical  institutions in India. The decay of medical colleges in Kerala reflects the  general trend in this country where almost all public sector undertakings have  failed in their mission. The few exceptions only prove the rule. I have seen  once proud academic medical centres becoming centres of revolt, anarchy and  political fiefdom. Research has taken a back seat. Many so-called missionary  hospitals, which did a lot of charity work in the past, have now become  profitable centers catering to the rich rather than the poor.

				<h4>Harassment  by medical teachers</h4>
				<p>
					Harassment of medical students is not new. Our teachers too subjected us to  harassment. In the 1960s, hardly 11 of the 100 or so in our batch were given an  'average' score in the internal assessment of the pre-clinical department, but  none of us dared to question our scores. If I remember correctly only 38 of us  cleared the first MBBS exam-ination that year in our first try. A similar pass  percentage today would probably bring on a medical students' riot. Teachers in  clinical subjects were more liberal in the past, but newspaper reports suggest  that changes have come about there as well.

				<h4>KGMCTA,  private practice and research</h4>
				<p>
					The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association (KGMCTA) used to  have devoted office bearers, and I believe that they still are. The KGMCTA is  not a powerful lobby, as Dr Nair suggests, but it may be true that some members  are centres of power.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like  any service organisation, the KGMCTA could do much for the common good through  collective bargaining. The most remarkable of its recent achievements is the  pay hike in 1997-98 bringing salaries on par with those in the central  government, or in autonomous medical institutions where private practice is  banned. Till about eight years ago, the maximum monthly salary of a senior  professor in a state college was less than Rs 10,000. Now a junior lecturer  gets more than that. A professor's pay scale is now Rs 16,400-22,400 with  additional perks and pension. Ostensibly, this pay hike was to stop private  practice by medical college teachers. Still, I agree that in a country where a  software engineer gets more than Rs 50,000 per month, the present salary scale  of a medical college teacher cannot be considered too high.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  KGMCTA had said earlier that it would support an end to 'private practice' once  the salary structure was on par with that of the central government. However,  now that it has happened, the KGMCTA has assumed an ambivalent posture. But,  this is a non-issue, since all health ministers except one have declared that  private practice is a 'social' necessity in Kerala.
				</p>

				<h4>Advantages  and disadvantages of private practice</h4>
				<p>
					As a  physician who had the benefits of private practice throughout his career, I can  see its pros and cons. When salaries of government medical teachers were just  about one-fourth of the present scale, it did not seem inappropriate to permit  doctors a restricted private practice from their residences. Most physicians  did well with this. However, surgeons often required hospital set-ups for their  work. As a result, private patients were given priority in admission and  preferential treatment in teaching hospitals, or were admitted in private  hospitals where the same surgeon went surreptitiously and operated in his  'free' time, against governmental restrictions. The free time was invariably  stolen from his 'hospital' time. As it was easier to use government hospitals  for private practice, poor patients had to wait interminably for their turn.  But, even this was certainly better than the situation in government hospitals  in the rest of India, as the public and a vigilant media in Kerala would not  tolerate gross irregularity for long.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  was another argument in support of private practice. Most research funding from  central government agencies was given to national medical institutions, with  few exceptions. Research requires a lot of money and is not done when money is  not available. Publishing research papers does not benefit medical college  teachers in Kerala as publications are not taken into account for promotions or  other benefits. Presenting research papers at medical conferences again  involves money, which young doctors can ill afford. Before the advent of home  personal computers, even making an ordinary projection slide cost about Rs 40.  An hour-long lecture requires at least 40 slides. Most of us paid for our  travel expenses and slides from our own pocket. The pharmaceutical industry was  more concerned with successful individual practitioners and the 'central'  institutions than 'research-minded' medical college teachers. Still, the  academic record of the teachers of medical colleges in Kerala was not inferior  to that of other similar institutions in the rest of India. 'Private practice'  certainly helped us to make a decent living.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again,  to get official leave to attend a conference was itself a task. The request had  to be processed through a number of authorities from the head of the department  to the health minister, with delays at each stage. Often, the order would come  after the conference was over. It was possible for teachers in Trivandrum  Medical College to use their local contacts to expedite the process. I believe  that things are still as bad as before in these medical colleges but not for  the staff of other medical colleges. I must confess that despite all these  hurdles, one sees excellent papers published from different medical colleges  even now, in both clinical and pre-clinical subjects.

				<h4>Ethical  issues</h4>
				<p>
					I  strongly disagree with Dr Mohanan Nair in his discussion of ethical issues in  Kerala medical colleges. Kerala does not have 'kidney villages' surrounding any  medical college. There are certainly many minor infringements in ethical  standards in these medical colleges, but they are insignificant when compared  with the state of affairs in the rest of India. Perhaps we will catch up with  other metropolitan cities in this matter as well.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Foreign  service</h4>
				<p>
					Like  the sabbatical leave given by some medical institutions, medical college  teachers are allowed to take leave. It was for up to 15 long years till  recently. I understand that it has been cut to about 10 years, and leave is not  given in specialties where there is a shortage of manpower. However, when somebody  holds a full-time post in a foreign country throughout his career as a medical  teacher here, Nair's argument becomes embarrassingly valid. It is true that new  posts are seldom sanctioned, fresh vacancies go unreported and teaching and  other services are affected.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have  all heard horror stories about some of the newly opened private medical  colleges in Kerala. Of course, there are a few private medical institutions  that are doing excellent teaching, clinical and research work. They are the  exceptions.
				</p>

				<h4>The  rise and fall of Trivandrum Medical College</h4>
				<p>
					The  history of the first medical college in Kerala is a story of dedication, will,  and eminent teachers and students. Dr C O Karunakaran and Dr R Kesavan Nair,  two great medical teachers, founded this institution in a record 16 months with  an initial funding of Rs 50 lakh. The first batch of 60 MBBS students joined  this college in 1951.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Trivandrum Medical College was a fulfilment of a popular ambition. Most of the  students of the initial batches stayed back and were instrumental in bringing  out the 'Kerala model' of healthcare delivery. Even though some Keralites have  criticised the very idea of the 'Kerala model', we have achieved a great deal.  Many of the alumni went abroad seeking greener pastures. They have all done  well in their chosen countries. But greater credit should be given to those who  stayed back and developed this institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later,  two other institutions came up in the campus of Trivandrum Medical College&mdash;the  Sree Chitra Tirunal Centre for Medical Sciences and Technology and the Regional  Cancer Centre. Both these institutions owe a good part of their success to the  alumni of Trivandrum Medical College.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  would be difficult for today's medical student to imagine that postgraduate  theses of Trivandrum Medical College were quoted as authoritative references in  standard textbooks way back in the 1960s and 1970s. Those days have gone. The  picture has been complicated by the many private colleges, staffed by retired  teachers of government colleges. There is bound to be resentment that medical  education is being made a commodity for the rich. More than half a dozen  private medical colleges have come up in the past 12 months in Kerala. Perhaps  it is too early to criticise them but even the prestigious ones among them put  up names of non-existing academic members in their staff list.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of  the issues raised by Dr Nair are applicable to almost every medical institution  in India. Variations of the same problems are seen in the so-called central  government and autonomous institutions as well. The constant bickering, the  dissatisfaction, anomalies in promotions and interpersonal clashes have made  some of these places miserable. Patient care also suffers as a result. The  basic trouble is that we Indians do not allow anything to flourish. If anything  worthwhile happens despite these efforts, we do everything to destroy it. The  ultimate beneficiaries are private medical institutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  time now for both the government and medical college teachers to introspect and  give proper guidance to the future of medical education in Kerala, where education  is considered supreme even by the common folk.
