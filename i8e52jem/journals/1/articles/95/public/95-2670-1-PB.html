				<h4>Markus Swan. Assassin in Svanstrand: insider trading on clinical trials, snow storm with beheadings. e-book: Clinical Trial Magnifier Limited; 2012. 258 pp. Kindle price INR 230.73. ISBN: 978-988-19041-3-3</h4>
				<p>
					The world of clinical trials is ethically fragile. Huge amounts of   money are at stake and a handful of people are privy to a lot of   confidential information about the trials. This imbalance in money and   knowledge sometimes results in an unholy nexus. Known as insider   trading, progress reports of a trial are sometimes passed on to   investors so that they can augment or deplete their share in the   investment before the trial results are officially made public. The   person(s) passing on the information would also have vested interests in   the profits. This unmitigatedly unethical practice is explored by the   book, using the genre of a murder thriller.

					Johan PE Karlberg (using the pseudonym Markus Swan) sets his   fiction in the picturesque locale of Svanstrand, a hamlet in Sweden,  in   winter. The story revolves around a desperate killer nicknamed "The   Fox", a handsome police inspector, Kacka, his efficient assistant,   Madelene Trolle, Markus Swan and his wife. The narrative is woven in   with the required elements of a thriller: death threats, murders, sword   fights, decapitated bodies (of humans and animals), spy cameras and   several miles of "Fox chase".  There's also a story of unrequited love.
				</p>
				<p>
					The story begins when Swan visits his summer house in Svanstrand   in the autumn; he happens to get a brief view of two people fighting,   but dismisses it as a local skirmish. However, when he returns with his   wife to prepare for a family Christmas, things start to snowball. First,   a headless body is fished out of the waters. It is believed to belong   to a man killed about two months earlier, presumably in the tussle that   Swan witnessed during his last visit. In a sub-plot, two women from Lund   are admitted to the city hospital with acute liver damage. Swan learns   of a herbal drug trial for weight loss that is on at nearby Lund. He   speculates that there is a connection between the trial and the   critically ill women. Many killings, Fox-hunts and death threats follow   before the story reaches its climax and the killer and their motives are   exposed.

					The novel reveals the dark underbelly of some clinical trials and   the extents to which drug companies can go to make huge profits and in   that sense it is extremely timely. In 2012, India was in the news after   it emerged that more than 200 trial participants had died within a span   of six months. However, this news is unlikely to ensure that informed   consent will be taken from participants in the future, let alone that   compensation is given for injuries or deaths in trial.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a literary piece, however, the novel loses pace at various   points, such as when Swan talks at length of other infamous and   unethical clinical trials. While such information is important, this is   not explicitly a history of medicine narrative, and the format does not   allow for such ruminations that dilute the tension that has been built   up. There are other historical details on the city of Darwolo, the AGA   cooker, Lakerol candies and even a few recipes, which might have been   reduced in number and length. There is an occasional problem with the   narrative voice &ndash; while the novel is largely in the first person, in   some instances the narrator assumes the voice of the third person   without explaining the shift. Also, each chapter has been penned in the   format of a personal journal, with a date and time at the start. But at   times, the temporal descriptions do not do justice to this format.   Perhaps this can be addressed in future editions of the book.
