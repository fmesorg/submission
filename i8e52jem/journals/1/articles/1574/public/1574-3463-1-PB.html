				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Over the four-and-a- half-year span of medical training, students are extensively grilled on how to  diagnose diseases and treat patients. The rules of conduct, which should guide  his behaviour when interacting with his own professional colleagues, is hardly  ever touched upon in the medical curriculum. These rules and laws actually  offer a framework within which the future doctor can act. Many students and  practitioners are genuinely surprised to know that rules actually exist. Some  know that some sort of ethical conduct is expected of them, but are not very  clear on the subject. This essay is an attempt at starting a discussion on the  ethics of relationships between doctors.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Forms of professional relationship</h4>
				<p>
					The doctor has to play many roles in his professional life. He is both student  and teacher during different periods of his career, a patient himself when ill,  or a doctor to another professional colleague. More pertinently, throughout his  career, he has to regularly interact with colleagues in his speciality and  those in different branches of medicine. The forms of professional relationship  between two doctors may thus be summarised as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						between student and teacher;
					</li>
					<li>
						between doctors (including       specialists) in the same discipline;
					</li>
					<li>
						between general practitioner       (GP) and consultant;
					</li>
					<li>
						between two doctors in       differing specialities;
					</li>
					<li>
						between the doctor and his       doctor-patient.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h4>Principles governing the relationship between  doctors</h4>
				<p>
					It is necessary to clear a general misconception that medicine and ethics are  two independent and divergent subjects, or that ethics is merely an adjunct to  medical activity. The two are irrevocably harnessed together, and this marriage  has been recognised since before the days of Caraka, Susruta and Hippocrates.  After all, medical ethics are those obligations of a moral nature which govern  the practice of medicine <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dunstan CR, Dunstan GR: The artifice of ethics. London: SCM Press, 1974." id="1">(1)</a>. In turn, the practice of medicine, in any field,  in any discipline, has been succinctly described as 'a long, continuous  sequence of ethical moments <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="William AR, Thomson A: A dictionary of medical ethics and practice. London: John Wright &amp; Sons Ltd, 1977." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  set of moral principles that must guide members of the medical profession in  their dealings with each other, is termed medical etiquette. The basis of a  good relationship between doctors lies in mutual respect and understanding. A  feeling of loyal camaraderie is essential, not only for the sake of the  profession, but also for the welfare of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rules  or codes of medical ethics are good templates to work. on. In this essay, only  those comments and rules that apply specifically to the relationship between  doctors will be covered. On this matter, the Medical Council of India <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a> declared the following clauses in its code of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I will give to my teachers the       respect and gratitude which is their due.
					</li>
					<li>
						I will maintain by all means in       my power, the honour and noble traditions of the medical profession.
					</li>
					<li>
						My colleagues will be my       brothers.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In  the same vein, the <em>International Code of Ethics</em> <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a> states the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						A doctor ought to behave       towards his colleagues as he would have them behave towards him.
					</li>
					<li>
						A doctor must not entice       patients away from his colleagues.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Some  rules are clear and precise. However, there is scope for debate and controversy  in many of the complex situations of our modern competitive life styles. Some  of these controversial areas will be dealt with individually, with frequent  references to the Indian code of medical ethics. Situations as they exist today  will be touched upon and attempts to achieve the ideal will be suggested.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Student and teacher</h4>
				<p>
					One of the tenets of the Hippocratic oath states that it is a physician's duty  to teach his students all he knows, freely and without thought for  remuneration. At an undergraduate level, the physician, (and I use this term in  the broad sense which encompasses doctors in all disciplines of medicine), is  teaching his future colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  onus of guiding and shaping a young mind should never be taken lightly. As  stated by Dr F. Udwadia, <em>"good teaching, though concentrating on essentials,  must question dogma, must arouse and encourage an attitude of inquiry and a  thirst for knowledge and serve as a stimulus for further study. Above all,  teaching must be imbued with an ethical slant."</em> <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Udwadia FE: Ethical problems in medical education. Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5: 37-39." id="4">(4)</a> The professionally sound and ethically upright teacher  is in the best position to appear as a role model for his impressionable  pupils.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  ideal is sometimes very far from reality. Full time teachers are often dull,  uninteresting and are themselves bored with the monotony of their teaching  careers. That they are underpaid and live in relatively modest conditions as  compared to those of their colleagues in private practice, does nothing to  improve their psyche. The cream of the medical profession is often enticed into  making their way onto foreign shores, or onto the more lucrative avenue of  private practice. Teaching jobs are often manned by professionals who start  working as a stop-gap arrangement and then just carry on, with very few being  truly motivated to take on the vocation of being a teacher. Many teachers view  their work as 'just another job'. Many of the truly gifted teachers may not be  motivated enough to take on the job, because of its limited returns. Some of  these same full-time teachers resort to coaching classes to boost their income.  This is unethical and is a source of corruption with all the undercurrents of  nepotism and misconduct. Students at the undergraduate level are striving not  just for the pass class. They know, and the teacher knows, that marks matter  tremendously for entrance. into the post graduate training programme. One does  not require much imagination to understand the implications of coaching classes  run by potential examiners or by influential staff members.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Government has got to realise that teachers, at all levels (and this definitely  includes school teachers), are in the best position to mould young minds. In  order to recruit good and gifted teachers, it is necessary to provide them with  salaries and amenities which are realistic and at least on par with the earnings  of those in practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					For  those already in the teaching profession, it is imperative to see that high  standards of teaching are maintained and improved upon with constant seminars  and workshops for the teachers. Teaching aids, computers, Internet facilities  and availability of the latest journals and literature on the subject are not  just a luxury, but a necessity in the fast changing world of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  the post graduate level, it is the duty of the teacher to train the young  doctor so that he learns to perform according to accepted international  standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  present, clinics are held often at erratic intervals and the science of  medicine is elaborated upon. Ethical issues may be touched upon in passing, but  ethical dilemmas are rarely the subject for detailed discussion. More often  than not, the teachers themselves scoff at and ridicule the behaviour and  practice of their own contemporaries. To exercise restraint and maintain the  dignity of their profession is something which many teachers, themselves, need  to learn. Students are shrewd and discerning and can easily read between the  lines when such comments are made. The effect of snide remarks on their minds  is usually the exact opposite of what the teacher hoped to achieve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conducting  coaching classes at the post graduate level too is unethical and opens up  immense possibilities for corruption and exploitation. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					At  an interpersonal level, sharing of knowledge and dissemination of scientific  information are very necessary in our profession. For the advancement of his  profession and for his own sake, a physician would do well to affiliate himself  with medical societies and scientific meetings and contribute his time, energy  and means, so that these societies may represent and uphold the ideals of the  profession. There is no age bar to the process of learning and it does not  matter whom one learns from. It should not be surprising that one day the  student may indeed be teaching his own professor in the course of conferences, seminars  and workshops. The physician who feels 'he knows it all and has seen it all' is  dangerous. Sooner or later he is going to harm some of his patients because of  his inability to keep up with the times and learn about recent advances and  techniques.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Professional services of physicians to each  other</h4>
				<p>
					A physician should consider it a privilege to render service to his colleagues  and their immediate dependants. The Indian code of ethics urges a physician to  '<em>cheerfully  render professional services to his physician-colleagues and their immediate  family members without seeking monetary compensation.'</em> However, there is no rule that a physician  should not charge another colleague for his services. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a> When called from a  distance to attend to, or advise, a colleague, he should be reimbursed for  travelling and other incidental expenses. Unfortunately, many doctors who  themselves require specialised or professional help from their colleagues cheat  on them by seeking free treatment for themselves, their families and also for  friends and distant relatives. This is unfair to the treating colleague, who  gives of his best, without receiving compensation for his time and efforts. In  this context, the terms 'immediate family' and 'dependants' require definition.  The immediate family consists of parents, spouse and children. Dependants  include non-earning members of the family dependent upon the doctor for their  survival.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Duties of the physician profession at large</h4>
				<p>
					Doctors may criticise one another, but only face-to-face and in complete  confidence. To criticise a colleague in front of a patient is both damming and  dangerous and can never be justified.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is equally important that the utmost care and tact be maintained when listening  to patients complaining about how they have been treated or handled by other  doctors. A patient who dislikes or develops a grouse against a doctor based on  some real or imagined mistake can be extremely disparaging and indiscreet in  his manner of speech. The mature doctor would do well to refrain from listening  to this tirade against a colleague. If, however, he cannot restrain the  agitated patient, he must studiously refrain from making any comment that could  possibly be construed as acceptance of the patient's criticism. Professional  loyalty demands understanding and mutual respect for your colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  the other hand a doctor is urged to expose incompetent or corrupt, dishonest or  unethical conduct on the part of members of the profession without fear or  favour as these are against the best interests of patients. The accused doctor  may be an alcoholic or a drug addict or a debauched person. Such matters may  have to be considered by medical tribunals or by specially appointed ethics  committees if they are not already<em>sub judice</em>. This cannot be considered as license for witch hunting or  slander. The responsibility is grave but must be followed through with courage  and honesty.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics of employment obtaining assistance of  non-medical men</h4>
				<p>
					In the matter of  employment of personnel who would be required to render professional skill and  discretion, the physician is morally obliged to recruit qualified attendants  who are registered and enlisted under the law in force at that time. Those who  are deficient in character or education should not be allowed to attend, treat  or perform operations upon patients, as this is dangerous to public health. By  enlisting non-medical men for medical tasks, the physician denies his  colleagues jobs and, at the same time, does a grave disservice to his patients.  If however the clinician does employ assistants to help him, the ultimate  responsibility in the event of any mishap rests solely with the doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  doctor asked whether he could utilise the services of a clinical laboratory  which was not being operated under the supervision of a qualified pathologist  but was run by a science graduate who had no medical qualifications. The reply  of the Maharashtra Medial Council was as follows, <em>"The medical practitioner  should not co-operate with the clinical laboratory conducted by a B. Sc. who  neither has medical qualifications nor works under the supervision of a medical  man. Such a person, by himself, is not competent to assess the results obtained  and as he is not directly under the control of the medical council, a report  submitted by him, if incorrect, will reflect upon the medical practitioner who  acts on the report."</em> <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  burgeoning home industry of small laboratories run by laboratory technicians or  by mere science students or less, is on the rise. There are, at present no  curbs on this sort of activity. The truth is, they prosper and multiply because  they are patronised by members of our own profession, who find such  laboratories cheaper than those run by professionally qualified pathologists  and microbiologists. The danger to patients from this selfish measure can be  considerable. In addition, injustice is done to our own qualified colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is also a proliferation of diagnostic and imaging centres, which are run as  businesses, manned by smart but ill-qualified personnel. The public may not be  in a position to understand the threats this may pose to their health. It is  necessary for our profession and the medical councils to take cognisance of  these centres and force them to run with some form of a license under the guidance  and direction of a fully qualified doctor. They, too, along with the pathology  and microbiology laboratories, must be subject to reviews and surprise checks  similar to those for blood banks.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  practice of doctors running drug shops, dispensing drugs and appliances  prescribed by other physicians also needs correction. This is the prerogative  of the qualified pharmacist. A physician should not run a shop for the sale of  medicine or for dispensing prescriptions prescribed by doctors other than  himself or for sale of medical or surgical appliances. This does not mean he  cannot prescribe or supply drugs, remedies or appliance for his own patients,  so long as there is no exploitation of the patient.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Advertising</h4>
				<p>
					The physician who sets  up practice and announces his presence with an unusually large signboard is  probably not breaking the law, but he is certainly acting unethically. A  doctor's signboard cannot have the status of a glossy hoarding. Both signboard  and the doctor's prescription pad should proclaim nothing more than the  physician's name, qualifications, titles and speciality. It is improper to  affix a signboard on a chemist's shop or in places where he does not reside or  work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advertising  lowers the dignity of the profession and entices or lures patients on the basis  of glamour rather than competence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Maharashtra Medical Council is aware of a growing menace of doctors who seek  self-glorification and who market themselves in newspapers, magazines and on  television. Doctors, surgeons and many quacks have been known to make tall  claims of successful. and fantastic surgeries, guaranteed cures for obesity,  cancer, AIDS and other diseases. Such individuals cannot wait for their work to  speak for itself. Instead, they indulge in talk shows, consultancy columns in  newspapers and advertisements of their arrivals and departures in various  cities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Maharashtra Medical Council is now taking cognisance of doctors who advertise  for various drugs, toothpaste products or remedies on TV and is also proceeding  against doctors who place huge advertisements in newspapers for slimming  programs and other quick money making programmes. Self promotion in any form is  a punishable offence under the rules laid down by the Medical Council of India  and the state councils. These also bar doctors from publishing their  photographs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unless  the Councils force the medical profession to realise that such conduct will  debar doctors from medical practice, this cheap exhibition is likely to worsen.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  physician cannot claim to be a specialist unless he has put in a number of  years of study and experience in the speciality, or he has the appropriate  University qualification. Once he becomes a specialist, he cannot and should  not work outside his speciality even for his friends. The ramifications of this  statement are far reaching. Cross practice of allopathy and other disciplines  of medicine like Homeopathy, Unani or Ayurvedic Medicine is wrong and it  behooves the clinician to restrict his practice to the discipline he is  specifically trained for. Dabbling in other sciences is unethical and  potentially dangerous. On a similar note, the anaesthetist, for instance,  should not do general practice nor should the neurosurgeon dabble in conditions  that fall within the domain of the neurologist. There is, however, scope for  debate on this issue when considering physicians who practice in rural areas,  where they are forced to offer services on many fronts, because of the  non-availability of qualified or specialist help. The rules have to be viewed  in the context of the circumstances and the intentions of the physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  institution run by a clinician for a particular purpose, such as a maternity  home or sanatorium or home for the blind or aged, may be advertised in the lay  press, but such advertisements should not contain anything more than the name  of the institution, types of patients admitted, facilities offered and the  residential fees. The names of the superintendent or the doctors attending  should not appear in the advertisement.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  code of ethics forbids cheap exhibition by doctors in the form of interviews  and articles published for the purpose of advertising themselves or soliciting  practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  doctor is permitted to write to the press under his own name, on matters of  public health or hygiene, or to deliver public lectures or give talks on the  radio or television on subjects of public interest. He is also permitted to  make a formal announcement in the press regarding the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						starting practice
					</li>
					<li>
						change of type of practice
					</li>
					<li>
						change of address
					</li>
					<li>
						temporary absence from duty
					</li>
					<li>
						resumption of practice
					</li>
					<li>
						succeeding to another practice
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					On a more pragmatic  note, the Indian code of ethics categorically states that the '<em>solicitation of patients  directly or indirectly be a physician, by groups of physicians or by  institutions or organisations is unethical.'</em> The physician who advertises his skills, achievements,  qualifications lowers his own dignity and that of the profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					No  physician should use touts or agents for procuring patients. He should neither  pay, nor receive a commission for referring patients.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Etiquette of inter - professional relationships</h4>
				<p>
					The British Medical Association <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">(2)</a> and the Medical Council of India <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a> state  that '<em>a practitioner in whatsoever form of practice, should take  positive steps to satisfy himself that a patient who applies for treatment or  advice is not already under the active care of another practitioner before he  accepts him.'</em> Furthermore '<em>a practitioner should  not accept as a patient any patient whom he has attended as a consulting  practitioner, or as a deputy for a colleague.'</em> Implementing this directive is not an easy task in a country  like ours where private practice is rampant and where patients often switch  doctors at will. Patients literally go shopping from clinic to clinic, or from  hospital to hospital for doctor's opinions. Unscrupulous doctors readily accept  any and every patient, often with full knowledge that the patient is under the  care of a colleague. Such a commercial approach to patient care reduces the  profession to a business venture.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics in consultations</h4>
				<p>
					Consultations are a time-honoured custom and they should be encouraged in cases  of serious illnesses, especially in doubtful or difficult conditions. In every  consultation the benefit to the patient is of the first importance. The rights  of the patient to ask for a second opinion should be respected. As in most  situations the attending practitioner is the best judge but his vanity should  not prevent him from refusing to recommend it, or to refuse to accede to the  patient's request for consultation with some other doctor. No medical  practitioner can claim to be a specialist in every branch of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  following suggestions made by the Maharashtra Medical Council in its Code of  Medical Ethics tersely state the important circumstances under which a  practitioner should ask for a consultation:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						in serious illness,
					</li>
					<li>
						in doubtful conditions,
					</li>
					<li>
						in operations of a mutilating       or destructive nature upon an unborn child,
					</li>
					<li>
						in operations which may vitally       affect the intellectual or generative function of the patient. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehta HS, Taraporevala VJ: Medical law and ethics in India. Bombay: The Bombay Samachar Private Ltd., 1963." id="3">(3)</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The  attending doctor may certainly suggest the names of the consultants of his  choice but even then, in the event of a difference of opinion between him and  patient or his relatives of the patient, the choice of the latter should  prevail.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  the event of irreconcilable difference of opinion between the two doctors, the  circumstances should be impartially and frankly explained to the patient  concerned. It is now up to the patient to decide which of these he will follow  or, indeed, whether he will seek further advice from a new consultant.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are points on the proper etiquette of consultation laid down in the International  Code of Ethics which are summarised as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The attendance of the       practitioner should cease when the consultation is concluded, unless the       patient has dispensed with the services of his first doctor and engaged       those of another.
					</li>
					<li>
						In no case should the       consultant treat the patient alone or hand him over to his assistant or       admit him to a nursing home or hospital without the knowledge of the the       referring physician or injure the latter's position in any respect.       (Emergencies form an exception to this rule. In such an event, the       consultant should inform the referring physician at the first opportunity       after the crisis has been tided over.)
					</li>
					<li>
						When a consultant sees a       patient in his rooms at the request of a medical practitioner, it is his       duty to write to the latter, stating his opinion on the case and the line       of treatment he thinks should be adopted. He should not see this patient       again without a fresh note from the first doctor.
					</li>
					<li>
						A doctor called upon in an       emergency must treat the patient, but after the crisis, the consultant       must retire in favour of the original attendant of the patient.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Fees - insofar as they concern our colleagues</h4>
				<p>
					A  practitioner's fee should be commensurate with the services rendered and the  patient's ability to pay. They must be reasonable. It is advised that the fee  be on par with those charged by his colleagues. The Medical Council of India  code of medical ethics further states that remuneration received for medical  services should be in the form and amount specifically announced to the patient  at the time the service is rendered. It is unethical to enter into a contract  of '<em>no cure no payment</em>'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  practice of splitting fees must be condemned as infamous conduct. A medical man  is a professional. He is not doing business. Splitting of fees stinks of  commercialism.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dichotomy  or splitting of fees is illegal. When a practitioner consults a specialist in  the interests of his patient, he is not acting as a business agent. The  practitioner has no right to demand or expect a cut from the specialist for  calling him in. The specialist in turn can charge the patient the appropriate  fee for his consultation visit.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The Code of Medical  Ethics offers this advice: "To other members of the profession you owe a  duty as a colleague. You should never do or say anything that may make the  position of your colleague awkward." There is a vast body of literature on  ethical issues written by medical men, lay public and by those who understand  the law. One sardonic statement, obviously written by someone who had clashed  with the medical profession reads as follows: "There are three subjects on  which the medical profession in general, is woefully weak. They are manners,  morals and medicine."
				</p>
				<p>
					Ironically  the author of that comment, was himself a doctor. There are many people in  different walks of life who share this view.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  introspection, there is no doubt that from time to time doctors do forget their  moral obligations to each other. Our colleagues and the layman are quick to  notice these deviations. If we aspire to retrieve the situation, we need to  look back at our graduation day and have another close and honest look at the  oath we swore when we so proudly assumed the prefix 'Doctor'.
