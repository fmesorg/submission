				<p>
					Obtaining valid consent is regarded as essential before there
					can be an ethically or legally appropriate medical intervention.
					The justification is, simply, that patient autonomy should be
					respected. The patient's body is hers, and she has a right to do
					with it what she chooses. In order for that choice to be real,
					it has to be a choice made by a patient who is competent to
					make it. That competence has two elements. First, the patient
					must have the cognitive hardware and software necessary
					to receive, retain and process the information, weighing the
					benefits and the burdens of the proposed treatment against
					each other. Second, the inputs must be the relevant ones:
					the information to be processed must be (i) accurate and (ii)
					sufficient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moulton et al describe and criticise the way the law of informed
					consent operates in England and the USA. They characterise
					the former as the application of the standard of the reasonable
					clinician, whereby the clinician will not be liable in the tort of
					negligence so long as she has provided the information that
					would be provided by a responsible body of clinicians in the
					relevant specialty. This characterisation is not entirely accurate.
					There has been a gradual evolution away from this position

Cambridge Law Journal. 2011 Nov;70(3):523&ndash;47." id="1">(1)</a>, with the House of Lords' decision in Chester v Afshar <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chester v Afshar 2004.

					marking the high watermark of judicial acknowledgement,
					in the context of civil litigation, of the importance of patients'
					autonomy rights. Professional guidelines, such as those
					produced by the UK General Medical Council <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Medical Council. Consent: patients and doctors making decisions together. edited by GM Council. London:GMC; 2008." id="1">(3)</a> also emphasise
					that patients should be at the center of the consenting process,
					and the vindication of their autonomy rights is the object of
					the procedure. The courts, in considering what is demanded
					of a "responsible" doctor, have regard to those guidelines. The
					authors' characterisation is a reasonably accurate description
					of the general legal and ethical zeitgeist, if not an accurate
					summary of the state of the substantive law. In the USA, they
					point out, there is a dual standard of information provision &ndash;
					the "reasonable doctor" standard and a patient-based standard
					("reasonable patient" standard).
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with the law in both jurisdictions is that it fails
					to honour the very principle (autonomy) which it purports to serve. Both the "reasonable doctor" and "reasonable patient"
					standards are bad at holding clinicians meaningfully to
					account, since they are amorphous: there is a wide variation in
					both physician practice and patient preference.

				<h4>So what is to be done?</h4>
				<p>
					They make two broad and related proposals. First, we need
					to change our language. The notion of a "consenting" patient
					needs to be abandoned. The word "consenting," they powerfully
					observe, "implies passive acquiescence in the doctor's decision,
					not an active informed choice on the part of the patient."
					Second, we need to adopt the theory and practice of shared
					decision-making (SDM).
				</p>
				<p>
					The first proposal might seem flippant. It is not. The language
					we use crucially conditions our attitudes. They suggest an
					alternative: "informed request". This, they say, "would be a better
					way to describe what is needed, ascribing an active role to the
					patient and acknowledging their decision-making role." The
					patient's declaration, which is now so often a meaningless
					acknowledgement that the clinician has mumbled his way
					through a list of incomprehensible complications, would be
					replaced with something along the lines of: "I have considered
					my options, reflected on my own values and preferences, and
					would now like you to proceed with surgery." It is a simple but
					critical shift from current practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					But what is this SDM? It is where patients and clinicians work
					together to select investigations, treatments and support
					packages, based on clinical evidence and the patients' own
					preferences. The authors emphasize a balance between
					autonomy and beneficence, grounded in SDM, using decision
					aids. Various aids can help: sympathetic presentations (perhaps
					graphical rather than merely verbal) of the relevant outcome
					probabilities; web-based tools that allow patients to control the
					information they receive based on their individual preferences
					(they are often either swamped with or starved of information);
					questionnaires which check the extent of understanding and
					patient involvement.
				</p>
				<p>
					There has been a shift from providing minimal information
					to providing too much information but it has not improved
					informed consent practices. Although the provision of
					information is important it is only valuable if it leads to
					understanding, otherwise it is pointless and can be harmfully confusing. The four models of doctor&ndash;patient relationships
					defined by Emanuel and Emanuel <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Emanuel EJ, Emanuel LL. Four models of the physician-patient relationship. JAMA. 1992 Apr 22&ndash;29;267 (16):2221&ndash;6." id="4">(4)</a> &ndash; informative model,
					interpretive model, deliberative model and the paternalistic
					model &ndash; provide a useful lens through which to view patient&ndash;
					doctor interactions in the context of information-provision. If
					the doctor&ndash;patient relationship is based on the "informative
					model," for instance, the doctor as a technical expert provides
					all the information and then implements the patient's chosen
					treatment option. This may result in the patient's autonomy
					being respected in a sense (although autonomy too requires
					that when patient autonomously authorises an option she
					should have understood what it is that she is authorising) but it
					may be that the chosen option is not in the best health interests
					of the patient. At the other end of the Emanuels' spectrum is
					the "paternalistic model," where the "beneficent" physician,
					basing her decision on medical facts, decides what option is
					best for the patient and the patient passively acquiesces. The
					patient's values and preferences are not taken into account.
					These two models reflect the polarity that Moulton et al
					argue against. A balance between autonomy and beneficence
					that Moulton et al propose can be achieved through patientcentred
					consultations, as seen in the "interpretive" or the
					"deliberative" models, in which, briefly, the physician engages
					with the patient and helps her to see the significance of the
					relevant medical facts in the light of the patient's own values.
					The consultation is a mutually respectful conversation, in which
					autonomy and beneficence negotiate a balance.
				</p>
				<p>
					SDM works. Various states in the USA: Maine, Minnesota,
					Oregon, Vermont and Washington, have legislated to promote
					SDM. It is early days, but it seems to change, very positively, the
					way that patients perceive their own treatment. It may, apart
					from being ethically the right thing to do,, make economic
					sense: there is now evidence that more surgical procedures
					are performed than fully (SDM) informed patients would wish
					<a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wennberg JE, O'Connor AM, Collins ED, Weinstein JN. Extending the P4P agenda, part 1: how Medicare can improve patient decision making and reduce unnecessary care. Health Aff (Millwood). 2007 Nov&ndash; Dec;26(6):1564&ndash;74." id="5">(5</a>, <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kennedy AD, Sculpher MJ, Coulter A, Dwyer N, Rees M, Abrams KR, Horsley S, Cowley D, Kidson C, Kirwin C, Naish C, Stirrat G.

Patients, intimidated by the amount or
					complexity of information, often opt for procedures that they
					would not choose if they were fully involved in the decision,
					frequently going passively along with the clinician's suggestion.
					The number of procedures would probably drop with SDM.
				</p>
				<p>
					It will, of course, be necessary to persuade clinicians and their
					lawyers that SDM does not pose a threat of litigation. That
					should not be difficult. The Washington legislation specifically
					provides that engagement in SDM is prima facie evidence of
					informed consent. That provision is no doubt helpful, but surely
					it is unnecessary. It would be hard for any claimant's lawyer to
					argue otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors' suggestions are pertinent in all jurisdictions. In
					many developing countries, (for instance Pakistan and India)
					the predominant form of doctor&ndash;patient relationship, (except,
					perhaps in a few urban centers populated by literate and
					wealthy patients), is paternalistic. Patients generally passively
					acquiesce in decisions made by the doctor or the family. There
					are many reasons for this, including low degrees of literacy and
					a rigidly hierarchical society. Yet SDM is possible and perhaps
					particularly important here. Moulton et al in their paper claim
					that well-designed information material and trained staff can
					engage patients in SDM, irrespective of the patient's social
					status. So all patients, anywhere, can and should become active
					participants rather than passive recipients of decisions made
					by others <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malik AY. Physician-researchers' experiences of the consent process in the sociocultural context of a developing country. AJOB Prim Res. 2011 Jul;2(3):38&ndash;46." id="7">(7)</a>. We would expect that in developing countries
					visual images would prove to be more effective vehicles of the
					necessary information, rather than text, speech or abstraction.
