				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					Despite the numerous policies, regulations and laws aimed at promoting and ensuring ethical practice in healthcare, ethical misconduct remains rampant. Perhaps something more is needed to encourage a genuine and sustained moral attitude and behaviour. To a casual reader, the regulations on ethics read merely as a list of do's and don'ts and their philosophical foundation is not clear. In actuality, morality is often grounded in philosophy. Traditionally, religious and theistic philosophies drove moral behaviour. However, this is changing due to the current trend of secularism. Hindu philosophies are among the oldest philosophies that are still thriving, and this article explores these philosophies and compares and contrasts them with some of the contemporary ethical theories to assess if they can add value to the field of medical ethics. The main theme of the article is dharma or righteous conduct, the concepts related to it and how these can have a bearing on the development of an ethical attitude and the practice of medical ethics.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					In the past century of medical history, innumerable policies, regulations and laws have been framed to promote and ensure ethical practice in all aspects of healthcare. Despite these measures, we are bombarded with reports of unethical medical practice and research misconduct with disturbing frequency. In the case of the few who are "caught", the penalties are punitive and the transformation in attitude and behaviour, if any, is usually more cosmetic than real. Many instances of unethical behaviour arise not from ignorance, but from an attitude of deliberately overlooking norms and regulations. Regulators, institutions, educationists, policy-makers and activists often despair over what further steps need to be taken  to promote a genuine and sustained moral attitude and behaviour. While we continue to harp on more strict regulations and better enforcement, have we been overlooking any other avenues that may exist?
				</p>
				<p>
					At present, the teaching of medical ethics focuses chiefly on principles, guidelines, rules and laws. Medical ethics is understood as a list of do's and don'ts and its practice is considered a matter of social and professional etiquette or a regulatory requirement. Even though many of the present ethical guidelines evolved from a sense of moral outrage at horrifying instances of human exploitation in the name of medical science, the philosophical foundation of these guidelines (ie an understanding of human beings, their purpose and inter-connectedness, and how they should behave towards one another) is not really evident to the casual reader of the regulations. Despite its commitment to ethics, medical decision-making is heavily influenced by the character of individuals and this, in turn, is shaped by the person's environment, experiences and personal philosophy. For all these reasons, there is a need to reiterate the philosophical foundation of ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditionally, the imperative for moral behaviour drew its strength from theistic beliefs. Since about the 17th century, more voices were heard in favour of basing moral behaviour on secular foundations. Immanuel Kant's categorical imperatives <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kant I. Kant's foundation of ethics. Fundamental principles of the metaphysics of morals. Millis, MA: Agora Publications Inc; 2007. pp 37-70." id="1">(1)</a> are clearly founded on a secular philosophy. At present, too, there is a popular trend of secularism, sometimes accompanied by a disregard for religion, and the theistic imperative for moral behaviour is losing ground. Despite the popularity of the secular trend, it appears that life is not really guided by the "secular philosophies." The imperative for moral behaviour is largely dependent on personal resolve, fear of the law, or a social obligation to abide by regulations. It is well known how resolve can be weakened, the laws bent or regulations overlooked. While secular philosophies do offer scope for a categorical imperative, theistic approaches can enhance and enrich this scope. Therefore, it is worthwhile not only to revive the philosophical foundation of ethical behaviour, but also its theistic moorings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each religion has its own distinctive derivation of ethics and morality. There is extensive written material on the Christian, Jewish and Islamic philosophies in relation to medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pfleiderer G, Brahier G, Lindpaintner K, editors.

Hindu philosophies are among the most ancient philosophies that are still flourishing and it would be interesting to see how they can contribute to present-day medical ethics.

				<p>
					This article dwells on some aspects of Hindu philosophies, particularly the concept of dharma.  A seemingly elaborate account of Hindu philosophies is presented here. However, in actuality, it is only a succinct outline that is meant to provide the reader with a glimpse of the system of thought. Unless one provides a background that acquaints the reader with the depth of the philosophies, it would be difficult to make a meaningful connection to medical ethics.

				<h4>What is Hindu philosophy?</h4>
				<p>
					The word "Hinduism" has been conventionally used to denote a  religion. However, it is also an umbrella term for a way of life, guided by a  wide variety of beliefs and rituals based on Vedic1 traditions. The <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Upanishads</em> are its foundational scriptures <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gambhirananda S. Translated by Swami. Eight Upanishads. Kolkata: Advaita Ashrama; 1957. 952 p." id="8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radhakrishnan,S. Indian Philosophy. Archives.org Volumes.1-2. [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20] Available from: http://www.archive.org/details/Sarvepalli.Radhakrishnan.Indian.Philosophy.Volume.1-2." id="9">9)</a>. The term Hindu philosophy actually  encompasses different schools of thought,2 of which <em>Yoga</em> and <em>Vedanta</em> retain their importance in the current practice of Hinduism. There are many  apparent and subtle differences amongst these schools of thought, and it is  difficult and problematic to comprehensively explain the terms associated with  or variations between the philosophies in a short article like this. The  various schools of thought are more or less in agreement that the purpose of  human life is to strive for spiritual progress, towards <em>moksha</em> or <em>nirvana</em> (liberation) - be it liberation from "the cycle of birth and rebirth" or from  "unhappiness and misery" - through an experience of oneness with God or the  cosmic Self.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Goals of life: thepurusharthas</h4>
				<p>
					In Hinduism, life is considered to consist of four stages: <em>Brahmacharya,  Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa</em>3. During one's passage  through these stages, one has to fulfil certain goals to have led a meaningful  life. These goals, known as the <em>purusharthas,</em> are <em>dharma, artha, kama  and moksha</em> <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radhakrishnan S. The Hindu view of life. London: Allen and Unwin; 1927. 92 p." id="10">(10)</a>. The scriptures4  offer guidelines and instructions on how these goals can be attained. Most of  the instructions are deontological in nature and have the tenor of categorical,  moral imperatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  common parlance, <em>dharma</em> simply refers to a person's religion. <em>Dharma</em> is commonly interpreted as rituals, duties,  caste rules or even the law, but such interpretations are reductionist. In philosophical terms, <em>dharma</em> refers to a way of life that is aligned to the  natural order of things. Natural order  itself refers to an orderly system in nature that is believed to be  divinely established, with the purpose of ensuring sustained maintenance of  life, in a peaceful and harmonious manner. While <em>dharma</em> signifies  actions that are aligned to the natural order of things, <em>adharma</em> would mean actions that are against this order.  It is believed that only the pursuit of <em>dharma</em> can bring about social harmony and peace in the  world. <em>Adharma</em> is believed to lead to  suffering, conflict, discord and imbalance. Therefore, <em>dharma</em> is also simply referred to as righteous conduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Human  beings are said to have certain duties or responsibilities during the four  stages of life that must be carried out in such a way as to sustain the natural  order.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, <em>dharma</em> means <em>carrying out all one's responsibilities</em>, <em>even while maintaining peace and harmony</em>. The words "duty" and  "responsibility" are used synonymously. Since the concept of <em>dharma</em> is part of a theistic philosophy, a person's foremost  responsibility is considered to be the expression of gratitude to God and to  the teacher / guru. Second in importance is a set of responsibilities arising  from the roles assumed in the family, ie that of a child, parent and grandparent.  These responsibilities include providing care, sustenance, protection and love.  The third set of responsibilities emanates from the premise that human beings  are social beings and embedded in society. As they derive a great deal from  society, they have a duty to give something back, to help others, serve those  who are suffering, and promote peace and harmony in society. The final  responsibility is towards nature, the environment and all forms of life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without material means, it would  not be possible to carry out these responsibilities. Therefore, <em>artha</em>,  the second goal, focuses on the need to earn material wealth as a <em>means</em> to abide by one's <em>dharma</em>. The essence of how one should achieve this  goal consists of earning wealth in a congenial manner, by virtue of one's own  efforts and hard work, without cheating, stealing, harming or causing loss to  others, without being driven by greed, and without disturbing peace and harmony  in society. Wealth should not be accumulated mindlessly; it should be  accumulated only to the extent necessary for meeting one's responsibilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Kama</em> is commonly  translated as "erotic love" or "sensual desire". However, in the context of the <em>purusharthas</em>,  it refers to the responsibility of love and of showing integrity in relationships.  It extends to the responsibility of procreation, too. The experience of  fulfilment and satiety must be at the emotional and psychic levels rather than  the physical alone. Thus, <em>kama</em> signifies something more than sensual desire  alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Moksha</em>indicates  "liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth". Such liberation would be  attained as a consequence of the fulfillment of the other three goals,  extending across all the stages of life, and is the result of a cumulative  effort over many births or lifetimes. In contemporary times, however,  liberation has also been interpreted as "liberation from unhappiness and  misery". It seems difficult to actually describe or experience liberation from  the cycle of birth and rebirth while it is possible to experience liberation  from unhappiness.
				</p>

				<h4>The telos of <em>dharma</em></h4>
				<p>
					An explanation of <em>dharma</em> is completely intelligible only if it also includes  an account of its telos or purpose. <em>Dharma</em> focuses not merely on the  action, but also on the <em>purpose</em> of the action and, in  extrapolation, the purpose of human life. A lifetime of practising <em>dharma</em> allows a person to flourish and live the good life,  which is somewhat similar to, though not exactly the same as, Aristotle's <em>eudaimonia</em> <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hursthouse R. In Zalta EN, editor. "Virtue Ethics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [Internet]. [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/" id="11">(11)</a>. Today, people's notions of the purpose of life  and a good life are extremely varied and controversial. Aristotle's <em>eudaimonia</em> entailed living well and taking part in activities  that exercise the <em>rational</em> part of the psyche, while  the purpose of life was to flourish. <em>Eudaimonia</em> was the "end" by itself.  The parameters for proof of a good life were wealth, power, friends and beauty.  In Hindu philosophy, a good life means performing activities that exercise the <em>spiritual</em> part of the psyche, while the purpose of life is to  attain <em>moksha</em> and not merely to  flourish. The parameters for proof of a good life are an "experience of peace,  harmony and lack of misery" <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radhakrishnan S. The Hindu view of life. London: Allen and Unwin; 1927. 92 p." id="10">(10</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sivananda S.

				<h4>The world as a cosmic family</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Vedanta</em>, in particular the Advaita version, sets forth the concept of cosmic  unity in clear terms. This concept regards all living and non-living entities  in the universe as one and the same, as mere expressions of the essence of the  large cosmos (the Whole). According to Advaita <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Advaita Vedanta. Advaita Vedanta homepage [Internet] [cited 2013 March 15]. Available from: http://www.advaita-vedanta.org." id="13">(13</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Date VH. Vedanta explained: Sankara's commentary on the Brahmasutras. New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal; 1973." id="14">14)</a>, the oneness can be experienced only when one  thinks of oneself not as a separate individual entity, but as a being who is  integrated with the whole cosmos; and <em>moksha</em> can be experienced only when this oneness is  experienced. Therefore, submergence of the self into the Whole and  abnegation of the sense of separateness or individuality is celebrated. This emphasis on cosmic unity has influenced  several physicists and philosophers, such as Einstein, Schrodinger, Spinoza,  Nietzche and Schophenhauer <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhaumik M. Code name God. New Delhi: Penguin Books India; 2006, pp. 26-34." id="15">(15</a>, <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Herbert N.

East-West interface of reality: a scientific inquiry into the nature of reality. Pune: ASSR Publications; 2003." id="18">18)</a>.  Besides influencing physicists' understanding of the universe, Advaita  has influenced the derivation of ethics in the Hindu ethos. According to Swami  Vivekananda, "...this oneness is the rationale of all ethics and spirituality...the  essence of all morality is to do good to others... whomsoever you hurt, you hurt  yourself. They are all YOU...." <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vivekananda, S. Jnana yoga: The yoga of knowledge. Kolkata: Advaita Ashrama; 1907." id="19">(19)</a>. Also, "Only when one can see oneself in  others, only then can one truly feel love and respect for others. The sense of universal brotherhood promoted by  this philosophy is echoed in the <em>Upanishads</em> as <em>vasudhaiva kutumbakam</em> (the whole world is my family) <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Warrier AGK, translator.

				<h4>Translating <em>dharma</em> into daily life</h4>
				<p>
					While abiding by <em>dharma</em> in <em>brahmacharya</em> (student life) - the first stage of life - one's responsibility is to educate  oneself, study and gain knowledge. The knowledge acquired should extend beyond  technical information to a knowledge of the scriptures and philosophy. Emphasis is also laid on the practice of  contemplation, as well as on efforts to understand the merits of a life of  simplicity, self-discipline and the judicious use of resources. This stage is  one of celibacy in thought, word and deed, so that the mind can remain focused  on studying. The potential for ethical enrichment offered to a medical student,  or for that matter, a student of any other health discipline, by the  prescriptions of <em>dharma</em> is clearly evident. The student phase can, therefore, be regarded as a  process that prepares the person to lead an ethical life in the second stage.  The second stage of <em>grihastha</em> is associated with the maximum level of social  responsibilities. This is the stage during which the most important  contribution is made to the organisation and sustenance of the entire society. Therefore, a person in this stage  is most in need of guidance. According to the <em>purusharthas,</em> this stage is of the maximum relevance in terms  of promoting righteous conduct in the fulfilment of all responsibilities (<em>dharma</em>), as well as  promoting righteous means of earning material wealth (<em>artha</em>) and a life  characterised by integrity <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radhakrishnan S. The Hindu view of life. London: Allen and Unwin; 1927. 92 p." id="10">(10</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Das S. The four ages of man;the four stages of Hinduism [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.hinduism.about.com/od/basics/p/fourstages.htm." id="21">21)</a>. Persons who are in positions of power of  any kind and whose decisions can have an impact on many people have a  responsibility to make fair and just decisions, free of any personal biases.  This, once again, draws attention to the relevance of <em>dharma</em> in research,  medical care, medical administration, policy development and governance. The  role of the moral foundation envisioned in the concept of <em>dharma,</em> during studentship  as well as in building a moral citizen in later life, cannot be overemphasised.  The occurrence of the theme of &lsquo;righteousness' is striking in the other eastern  philosophy, Buddhism, as well, in the articulation of the goals of life or the  eight-fold path to salvation5 <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The noble eight fold path. Buddhas.net [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.buddhas.net/path.html." id="22">(22)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					An exploration of the meaning of each of these goals  seems to indicate that <em>dharma</em> is the first, most  important, and overarching goal, which extends to <em>artha</em> and <em>kama</em>. These three goals are the  means to the ultimate goal of <em>moksha</em>. It is also evident that  the aspirations of human beings are fully acknowledged and permitted - in fact,  human beings are exhorted to fulfil their aspirations - but within a framework  of duty on one side and spiritual attainment on the other. This is reflected also in the manner in which  the goals are listed, ie <em>artha</em> and <em>kama</em> are positioned between <em>dharma</em> and <em>moksha.</em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Attaining the goals of life</h4>
				<p>
					The gap between knowledge  and practice in human behaviour is well known. A theoretical knowledge of <em>dharma</em> alone does not  suffice. Some attitudes and qualities are said to be needed to practise <em>dharma</em>. Guidance on  how to acquire those qualities is available in the scriptures and writings of  all the schoolsof Hindu philosophy. Such guidance is mostly in the form of prescribing the virtues to be cultivated and  advising against certain vices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shankaracharya's <em>Viveka Chudamani</em> promotes  the virtues of<em> viveka</em>, <em>vairagya</em>, <em>shat-sampatti</em> and <em>mumukshutva</em><a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavananda S. Vivekachudamani of Sri Shankaracharya. Kolkata: Advaita Ashrama; 1957." id="23">(23)</a>. <em>Viveka</em> is the wisdom to discriminate; to discern between  what has enduring value and what does not, in all affairs of daily life,  ranging from mundane matters such as eating and drinking to more serious ones. <em>Vairagya</em> is  dispassion or freedom from self-indulgence. Self-indulgence is considered to  have no enduring value and is, therefore, discouraged. <em>Shat-sampatti</em> literally  means a "treasure of six virtues". It refers to cultivation of a frame of mind  which is calm and quiet, and which can control negative thoughts, endure  hardship with equanimity and draw mental strength from within oneself rather  than depending on external support. It also includes having firm faith in the  guidance offered by one's spiritual teacher. <em>Mumukshutva</em> refers to an intense longing and aspiration  for <em>moksha</em>.  This intense longing appears to be the ultimate driving force of morality.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his <em>Yoga Sutras</em> (aphorisms),  Patanjali, prescribes adherence to the <em>Ashtanga Yoga</em><a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Veda Bharati S. Yoga sutras of Patanjali with the exposition of Vyasa. 1st edition. New Delhi: Motilal Banarasidass;2001." id="24">(24)</a>, which comprises the qualities of <em>yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana and samadhi. Yama</em> (vow of  self-restraint) and <em>niyama</em> (disciplined daily routine) are regarded as the  primary steps and the moral backbone of <em>Ashtanga  Yoga,</em> as they cultivate an  ethical discipline.
				</p>
				<p>
					The purpose of developing  all these qualities is to still the mind and distance it from the chaos of the  myriad thoughts and desires that distract one. In this way, one's thoughts will  be pure, and one will experience contentment and be able to practise austerity.  This will enable one to focus on higher goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the vices that  hinder human beings from performing their <em>dharma</em> (duty<em>)</em> are said to be unbridled sensual desire, avarice,  envy and vicious anger. It is held that these vices can be overcome  through knowledge gained from the scriptures (<em>Jnana Yoga</em>), unconditional  devotion to God (<em>Bhakti Yoga</em>), or detached and selfless work (<em>Karma Yoga</em>).  Learning about <em>Karma Yoga</em><a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vivekananda S. Karma Yoga [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.vivekananda.net/PDFBooks/KarmaYoga.pdf." id="25">(25)</a> is useful in understanding the motivation for  abiding by <em>dharma</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a literal sense, <em>karma</em> means actions and <em>yoga</em> means spiritual  union. Therefore, <em>Karma Yoga</em> is described as a way of thinking, willing and  acting, by which one orients oneself towards one's spiritual goal. Humans beings  are supposed to act in accordance with their <em>dharma</em> (duties), giving no consideration to their  self-centred desires, likes or dislikes. They are supposed to act without an  eye to the fruits of their deeds. They should not think about whether they will  succeed or fail, as long as the performance of their deeds is marked by  complete involvement and commitment to their <em>dharma</em>. In short, <em>Karma Yoga</em> is selfless action or  selfless work. When one performs one's duties or work with such an attitude, it  amounts to service. The <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> <a class="reference" href="#thwentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chinmayananda S. The holy Geeta, a commentary. Mumbai: Central Chinmaya Mission Trust; 1992. Alexander L, Moore M.In Zalta EN, editor. Deontological Ethics, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [Internet]. 2012 winter edition [cited 2013 Aug 28]. Available from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/" id="26">(26)</a> offers detailed explanations of and guidance  on <em>Karma Yoga</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is interesting to note that the guidelines on <em>dharma</em> closely resemble the precepts of Deontology <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Alexander L, Moore M. In Zalta EN, editor.Deontological Ethics, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [Internet]. 2012 winter edition [cited 2013 Aug 28].

The exhortation to cultivate virtues  closely resembles Aristotle's promotion of virtue ethics <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Virtue ethics.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20].

				</p>
				<p>
					As is evident, whatever  the school of Hindu philosophy, the virtues to be inculcated are very similar.  Followers can pick and choose the individual philosophy according to their  inclinations. The virtues embodied in  Hindu philosophy have a universality, in the sense that no other religion or  secular order would contradict them and, indeed, many of them find mention in  the scriptures and literature of other religions, too. Practising these virtues  seems a difficult task and a serious enterprise, but it appears that it would  give rise to a mental attitude that promotes responsible behaviour. It promotes selflessness, an expansive  worldview, moral behaviour and altruistic motives which are tangibly different  from the qualities inspired by man-made regulations and constitutional law.

				<h4><em>Dharma</em> and current medical ethics</h4>

				<p>
					Most medical professionals embark on their career with a  commitment to morality and ethics. However, when they enter the world of competition, and a society that  values name, fame, money and power more than spiritual progress, their  commitment to ethical behaviour can easily weaken. The commitment to an ethical  attitude needs constant reinforcement. <em>Dharma</em>, both through the ethical  discipline it demands in everyday life <em>and</em> through its theistic  moorings, may provide this reinforcement. Moreover, when <em>dharma</em> is understood and frequently reiterated as the primary purpose of life, it may  serve to balance and temper a person's worldly aspirations.
				</p>
				<p>
					It may be asked how <em>dharma</em> can actually help in the  care of individual patients. Most of the existing ethical theories, be they  Deontology, Utilitarianism, Consequentialism or Principlism, offer only a broad  framework for action. Making an ethical decision in a particular situation  still requires an interpretation of the theory. Sometimes, theories, principles  or guidelines seem to be in conflict with one another, ultimately necessitating  an interpretation based on the context. The theories mentioned above offer no  further guidance. The person has to depend on practical wisdom to choose the  right course of action. <em>Dharma,</em> too, provides only a framework for action.  However, the virtues that must be practised to abide by <em>dharma</em> also promote mental discipline and practical wisdom (<em>phronesis,</em> according  to Aristotle<em>; viveka,</em> according to Hindu philosophy).On the basis  of this, one can make ethical, fair and practical decisions that are aligned to  one's deeply held values.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are innumerable principles, guidelines and regulations  in use today, but awakening the <em>ethical attitude</em> to honour them  is the challenge. It must be stressed that <em>dharma</em> is not yet another  ethical principle that can be applied to resolve ethical dilemmas - instead, it  represents a way of life that awakens, promotes and sustains an ethical  attitude. An awakened ethical attitude would enable a person to interpret situations wisely and judiciously apply the  ethical principles and theories already in use. Guidelines, regulations and  laws would then be seen as the means, and not the end, in so far as ethical  behaviour is concerned. Thus, <em>dharma</em> would have an overarching  influence on decision-making in healthcare, encompassing and extending beyond  individual medical care.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Dharma</em> could influence decision-making in many  aspects of healthcare. The concept of cosmic unity <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Advaita Vedanta. Advaita Vedanta homepage [Internet] [cited 2013 March 15]. Available from: http://www.advaita-vedanta.org." id="13">(13)</a> stresses the  interconnectedness of all components of creation. Each living body is regarded  as a microcosmos that is a complete reflection of the macrocosmos around, and, therefore,  every human action has a consequence on the environment. An understanding of  the cosmic dimension of human life may significantly influence the way we look  at our world and at our behaviour in it. It may define a framework for our  aspirations, be they in terms of technological progress, longevity,  regenerative medicine or freedom from disease. It may provide a direction to  research and scientific progress towards genuine social beneficence.  Understanding the cosmic dimension has the potential to sensitise us to  approach the universe with respect and awe, and to teach us to value the  environment and make judicious use of diminishing resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					When divinity is recognised in all forms of life, one will  hesitate to treat any form of life merely as a means to achieve one's own ends.  This is very similar to Kant's second categorical imperative <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kant I. Kant's foundation of ethics. Fundamental principles of the metaphysics of morals. Millis, MA: Agora Publications Inc; 2007. pp 37-70." id="1">(1)</a>, but it has a  philosophical <em>and</em> theistic foundation that helps one understand the  essence of respect for persons and informed  consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is now being realised that there are fundamental  differences in the foundation for medical ethics between cultures. Western  philosophies encourage discovery, as well as  the enhancement and maintenance of individuality, the principle of autonomy  being an expression of this individuality. Autonomy is, therefore, often  regarded as the most important of the four ethical principles. Flowing from  this concept is the tendency to demand moral behaviour from others as a matter  of right. The Hindu philosophies, on the other hand, promote abnegation of the  self and submergence of individuality. Those who are followers of <em>dharma</em> are intensely aware  of their responsibilities towards others and the impact of their choices on  them. Therefore, the person is most likely to focus on making choices that are  the least self-centred, the least harmful and the most beneficial to others.  This seems to indicate that beneficence and non-maleficence would be regarded  as more important than autonomy. When social beneficence and non-maleficence  drive medical care, the potential to deliver ethical care increases  tremendously.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, there are plenty of complaints regarding the  deteriorating standards of work ethics amongst medical professionals.<em> Karma  Yoga</em> <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vivekananda S. Karma Yoga [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 20]. Available from: http://www.vivekananda.net/PDFBooks/KarmaYoga.pdf." id="25">(25)</a> offers guidance on the work ethic of professionals. Its  ideals are rigid self-discipline and  self-restraint, total absorption in one's path of action, and setting high  standards for oneself to provide dedicated service. To a follower of <em>Karma Yoga</em>, <em>dharma</em> would mean selfless service, working for the benefit of society and not for rewards, and aspiring for honesty and perfection  in action. These translate into attending to one's duties promptly; delivering  rational, cost-effective and good-quality medical care; focusing on care rather  than monetary profits; and being genuinely committed to serving the sick rather  than gaining fame, wealth, position and power. They also imply that it is  important to ensure the veracity and legitimacy of the results of scientific  research. Most importantly, <em>the ideals of Karma  Yoga are supposed to be pursued for the self and not others</em>. Thus, moral behaviour and self-policing are  driven internally, and the need for external monitoring and regulation is not  so strong. This attitude has become rare in the present age, though it is  extremely important, not only for practising ethical medicine and conducting  ethical clinical trials, but also for creating role models for future  generations of medical students.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Karma Yoga</em> can influence the delivery of healthcare in other  ways, too. As it requires one to perform one's duty selflessly, without an eye  to the benefits of one's success, any work done in this spirit is a service to  humanity. If the philosophical foundation of one's work consists of the  submergence of &lsquo;I' as the achiever or doer, the submission of all the fruits of  one's actions to God, and contentment and detachment, there is bound to be a  clash with concepts such as intellectual property rights and patents. In this  context, <em>Karma Yoga</em> translates into giving greater importance to non-economic social values in the  development of drugs as well as the marketing strategies for drugs. Providing  medical care and conducting research to develop new treatments are regarded as  one's duty, and this duty must be fulfilled with the expectation of no more  material gain than is necessary to fulfil other social responsibilities. The  high cost of medical care today can be attributed partly to the pricing  policies protected by patents laws and intellectual property rights and partly  to personal aspirations for the accumulation of immense wealth. Would it be  possible to consider a paradigm shift in which the personal benefits of  research or medical skills are not demanded as a matter of entitlement, but are  accepted humbly and considered a spontaneous bestowal of appreciation or  gratitude by the society, based on the social worth of the achievement? Such questions are not easily resolved.
				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of <em>dharma</em> has many areas in common with the current practice of medical ethics and  further enriches it. When one has explored and gained a thorough understanding  of the virtues, it seems that the virtue of <em>satyam</em> (truth) does not refer to merely speaking the truth. It  means the permeation of our thoughts, words, deeds and relationships with our fellow  human beings by truth. It posits  the imperative for integrity in research, maintaining an appropriate  relationship with patients, disclosure of  medical error, transparency in the consent process, etc. It implies opposition  to plagiarism and falsification of data. <em>Ahimsa</em> is not a matter of refraining from killing alone,  nor is it mere vegetarianism. It also implies kindness and care for all forms  of life. It also signifies refraining from mindlessly destroying a colleague  and from causing undue harm or pain during research, as well as being judicious  in the pricing of services so that the "economic violence" of sickness can be  reduced. The concept of <em>vasudhaiva kutumbakam</em> ("the whole world is my family") promotes a  universal attitude of caring and service, which is the cornerstone of ethics in  healthcare.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					People choose their  professions on the basis of their capabilities, inclinations and circumstances.  Many young medical students say they chose the medical profession because they  wanted an opportunity to serve others. Society has long respected the medical  profession for its commitment to service and the alleviation of suffering. It  is apparent that <em>dharma</em> and medical science have a common aim - to  make humanity happier by reducing suffering. So, they could be regarded as  convergent or even complementary. Albert Einstein said, "Science without religion is lame, and religion  without science is blind." Recognising this fact and assimilating it  into our practice of medicine would lead to an intelligent combination of technical skills, compassionate understanding  and spiritual/religious values, ultimately  benefiting the very art of healing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Present-day  guidelines and policies have reduced ethics to a mere social etiquette and  glibly articulated forms for informed consent. However, morality and  ethics are a way of life and not something  to be thought of only when providing medical care, running a hospital, making  medicines or conducting research. Medical ethics is only one of the many  expressions of a moral life. Ethics is also reflected in the way we treat our  fellow beings, the choices we make and the aspirations we nurture, in all walks  of life and at all times. If one interprets ethical behaviour from a "<em>dharmic</em>"  perspective, ethics seems to acquire a transcendental dimension and an  ontological foundation that steps beyond the domains of patient autonomy and  consent forms. The <em>dharmic</em> perspective imparts more categorical strength  to ethics and posits that ethics is articulated not merely as a legal or  regulatory imperative, but also a spiritual imperative. Thus, there are enough merits in the philosophy of <em>dharma</em> to warrant a closer and deeper exploration of its  importance to medical ethics, both in the teaching and practice of medical  ethics.

						Only an approximation of their meaning can be  expressed in English. <em>Yama</em> refers to a vow of moral self-restraint. It is a  vow of restraint against vices likes violence, falsehood, incontinence of  urges, theft and greed. In a more positive sense, it could be interpreted as  restraining one's impulses and temptations so as to encourage adherence to  non-violence (<em>ahimsa</em>), truthfulness (<em>satya</em>), celibacy in thought, word and deed (<em>brahmacharya</em>) and  non-covetousness (<em>aparigraha</em>), and to refrain from stealing (<em>asteya</em>). <em>Niyama</em> are rituals or routines to be practised every day  so that they become integrated with one's character and give one the moral  strength to abide by the vow of self-restraint. Thus, <em>yama</em> and <em>niyama</em> are  interrelated.The process of following the routines gives rise to a sense of  discipline and focus, which is conducive to internal and external purity (<em>saucha</em>), contentment (<em>santosha</em>) and austerity.  These allow one to remain focused on spiritual goals and study (<em>tapas and svadhyaya</em>). <em>Yama</em> and <em>niyama</em> are regarded as the  primary steps without which the rest of <em>Ashtanga  Yoga</em> will not prove fruitful. <em>Asana</em> and <em>pranayama</em> refer to  controlling the body and breathing with the help of postures of meditation and  breathing exercises, respectively. These seemingly physical exercises are  important psychic practices which are built on the foundation of <em>yama</em> and <em>niyama</em> and are, in turn,  essential for the next four steps of <em>Ashtanga Yoga</em>: <em>pratyahara</em> (withdrawal of the mind from all external  objects and all internal images), <em>dharana</em> (concentration), <em>dhyan</em> (meditation) and <em>samadhi</em> (unification of the self with God).
