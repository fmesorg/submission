					<strong>Peeyush Jain</strong> speaks out against a disturbing trend in medicine
				</p>

					The  young doctor was posted in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory soon after  joining a cardiology fellowship. One day, while looking at a coronary  angiography film, he asked done of his seniors, "What should be done for such a  lesion?" The senior smiled and replied, "We should treat the patient, not the  lesion." This statement made a deep impression on the junior.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, the senior fellow became professor, took premature retirement, said  good-bye to academics and became director of interventional cardiology in a  major private organisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As professor, he was famous for his respect for the rules laid down in the  textbook of cardiology. He never recommended angiography without careful  consideration. All his angiofilms were thoroughly discussed in the morning  conference, and further course of action was decided collectively. Some  patients were advised coronary angioplasty, others were referred for coronary  bypass surgery, while a substantial number continued drug treatment and were  followed up.
				</p>
				<p>
				After starting his practice there was a perceptible change in the former  professor's clinical approach. Now he started advising coronary angiography for  nearly all patients suspected to be suffering from coronary heart disease. And  following angiography, he began advising angioplasty or surgery for almost all  patients whose diagnosis was confirmed. It seemed as if he had lost faith in  drug treatment. His decision to implement interventional therapy became more  <em>ad-hoc,</em> prompt and lesion-oriented. A substantial number of such patients had  been asymptomatic, detected during routine screening. Lastly, he started taking  all crucial decisions alone, as there was no provision for angio-conference or  collective decision-making in his new organisation. </p>
				<p>
					The junior fellow came back from a foreign assignment and joined the  ex-professor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soon thereafter, the junior colleague noticed the drastic change in his  senior's approach. One day he could not resist the temptation to ask him the  reason for such a turnaround. The ex-professor replied, "Well there are many  reasons. The most important reason is economic. When I was a professor, I was  not worried about money. I was only concerned about quality. But now, if I  don't perform a minimum number of procedures, I will lose my annual raise or  even endanger my position as the director. This is a commercial organisation,  you see. The other reason is that if I don't perform angioplasty or surgery in  most of these patients, somebody else will, so why not me?"
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though this story is a mixture of fact and fiction, it reflects the  overwhelming trends of the day. Institutional medical practice in India today  has two diametrically opposite styles of functioning, which bear little  resemblance to each other. These differences have become accentuated after the  introduction of high-tech medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no doubt that many academic institutions in the country are crumbling.  Talented people are leaving for greener pastures. The quality of service may be  deteriorating due to shortage of funds, large number of patients, lack of vision,  slow decision making and corruption. But all said and done, the primary  objective of such institutions still remains patient welfare. Therefore, most  physicians there find their work satisfying, despite their relatively low  wages. Various checks and balances provided by seniors, juniors and  contemporary colleagues prevent patient mismanagement. Serious cases and  treatment alternatives are discussed on clinical rounds, before major decisions  are taken. So the primary objective of optimal patient care is still achieved  in the great majority of cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no dearth of vision, funds, and dynamism in the private medical  sector. Such organisations should be able to provide much better care to  patients. Alas, this is not always the case. The heart of the matter is that  the primary aim of such institutions and the people working there is to provide  service for a fee and reap the profits. This by itself may not be a bad idea,  provided it is implemented without breaking basic ground rules of medicine. The  most important rule perhaps is that there should be likelihood of effectiveness  of a treatment and a low probability of causing harm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some common practices in cardiology flout the above rule of medicine. Today,  cardiologists as a clan are thriving on costly invasive procedures and surgery  which may not be indicated in a significant number of cases. Re-vascularisation  of infarct related territory and surgery for non-critical valve disease are  prime examples of such misguided practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with private medical care in this country is that there is  virtually no control over its style of functioning. Doctors working in these  institutions are by and large free to form their own sets of rules,  irrespective of textbook guidelines. The lack of regulatory measures over  medical care has caused an exorbitant and inappropriate increase in medical  expenditure in this poor country. It is high time that some uniform practice  guidelines are formulated and enforced strictly to curb this disturbing trend.
