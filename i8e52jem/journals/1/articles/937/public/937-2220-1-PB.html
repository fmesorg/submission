				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					In response to a strike action by some doctors at the Safdarjung
					Hospital, the Delhi Medical Council issued a statement, in
					December 2010, that it was "...of the view that under no
					circumstances doctors should resort to strike as the same puts
					patient care in serious jeopardy and such actions are also in
					violation of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct,
					Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Delhi Medical Council, Order No. DMC/DC/F.14/Comp.777/2/2010/113022 to 113025 [Internet].

					as this are common responses of medical councils across the
					world whenever they are confronted with the increasingly
					difficult issue of striking doctors. Evidently, these statements
					are not effective in stopping doctors from repeatedly engaging
					in strike action. In India, the statement by the medical council
					was, for instance, followed by many strikes, amongst which was
					the well-publicised nationwide strike initiated by the Indian
					Medical Association in June 2012 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ekbal B. IMA strike: need for public debate. Indian J Med Ethics. 2012 Oct-Dec; 9 (4):226-8." id="2">(2)</a>. It is not difficult to see why
					strike action by doctors will continue, in India and elsewhere,
					despite opposition by the medical councils. The usual reasons
					why doctors go on strike relate to issues concerning pay,
					contractual relationships, and work conditions. It would appear
					that as long as doctors maintain their employee status, they
					will, just like other occupational groups, engage in industrial
					disputes with their respective employers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Strike action by doctors always precipitates intense ethical
					debates. Those who see strike action as unethical often cite
					some of the following arguments in support of their view <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frizelle F. Is it ethical for doctors to strike? N Z Med J. 2006 June 23;119(1236):U2037" id="3">(3)</a>:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Doctors are already overpaid and cannot justifiably
						continue to demand more.
					</li>
					<li>
						Doctors should be selfless healers who are not really in it for
						the money, but to care for the sick.
					</li>
					<li>
						Doctors cannot strike because if they do, it will result in
						avoidable deaths and suffering to the sick.
					</li>
					<li>
						A strike by doctors amounts to holding the sick and weak
						to ransom for material gain.
					</li>
					<li>
						Doctors are supposed to adhere to a professional code of
						conduct that prohibits them from participating in strikes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Academic writers on this subject tend to either offer
					arguments supporting the above, or offer counterarguments.
					This approach is appropriate for answering the question
					of whether strike action by doctors is always unethical, as
					held by the Delhi Medical Council, for instance. A number
					of ethicists have argued persuasively that strike action by
					doctors is not always unethical and may, in fact, be justified
					under some circumstances. This conclusion is usually reached
					after providing counterarguments to the list of arguments
					enumerated above <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frizelle F. Is it ethical for doctors to strike?

Doctors and strike action: Can this be morally justifiable? SA Fam Pract. 2009;51(4):306-8." id="5">5)</a>. This paper builds on the work done by the latter group, and attempts to establish certain general
					criteria to clarify the circumstances under which strike action
					by doctors may be justified.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Why the need for criteria?</h4>
				<p>
					Perhaps before setting out the criteria, our first task is to defend
					the need for such criteria in the first place. The role of criteria
					in addressing moral problems, it may be argued, is limited and
					futile as criteria in themselves seldom provide solutions for
					moral problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					While criteria are often not sufficient in addressing moral issues,
					their utility in ethics cannot be dismissed lightly. They are
					often employed as useful checklists of important issues to be
					considered whenever a highly valued ethical principle or ideal
					is to be breached. The Siracusa principles are, for example, a set
					of criteria to be borne in mind by any government considering
					the restriction of individual human rights for a public health
					course <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gruskin S, Loff B. Do human rights have a role in public health work? Lancet 2002 Dec 7; 360(9348):1880." id="6">(6)</a>. These safeguard the highly valued ideals of
					human rights and provide a way by which human rights may
					legitimately be restricted in the interests of public health. One
					can draw a parallel to the jus ad bellum (or just war criteria),
					which provides moral criteria for determining whether war is
					morally justified or not <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Snauwaert DT. The Bush Doctrine and Just War theory. Online J Peace and Conflict Resolution. 2004;6(1):121-35." id="7">(7)</a>. These criteria are not meant to make
					the decision to go to war an easy one, but rather to safeguard
					the general presumption in favour of peace, and represent a
					general checklist of rigorous conditions to be met if war cannot
					be rationally avoided.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the context of a strike by healthcare workers, in which
					human life needs to be safeguarded and unnecessary human
					suffering prevented, criteria would, in a similar way, provide a
					moral calculus for determining whether the strike is morally
					justifiable.
				</p>

				<h4>Six criteria for a just strike action by medical doctors</h4>
				<p>
					In medicine, as reflected in the Hippocratic Oath, there is a
					general presumption against a strike action by doctors as the
					action may result in unnecessary (and preventable) human
					suffering. If a strike action cannot be rationally avoided,
					however, rigorous conditions must be met for the strike
					action to be justified. It is suggested that any strike by doctors
					that meets all of the following criteria may be deemed to be
					reasonable and perhaps justified.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						Just cause and right intention: Doctors may go on strike only
						for a just cause, backed by right intentions. Strike action
						may not, for instance, be initiated for self-enrichment,
						or out of revenge or hatred towards the government of
						the day. In the healthcare context, a just cause is one that
						is intended to confront a real and certain danger to the
						health of the population. Put differently, it is one that
						seeks to secure and preserve the conditions necessary for
						the health of the population, as well as to defend (or stop
						grave violations of ) the right to the health of individuals
						or communities. The just cause, so construed, does not
						exclude the issue of wage disputes, which often lead to strike action. Wage disputes, however, constitute a just
						cause only if the wages of the doctors can be shown to be
						so poor as to compromise public health. Two of some of the
						well-known strike actions by doctors - those in Israel and
						Malta - are good illustrations of situations in which poor
						wages were a significant threat to public health. The Israel
						strike in 1983 involved an estimated 90% of the country's
						doctors working in the public sector. At the time, doctor's
						salaries were far below the mean standard for the country.
						To earn a salary equivalent to that of a nurse or an x-ray
						technician, for example, doctors often had to compensate
						by adding an additional six to eight night shifts per month
						to their 45-hour working week <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Grosskopf I, Buckman G, Garty M. Ethical dilemmas of the doctors' strike in Israel. J Med Ethics. 1985;11:70-71. doi:10.1136/jme.11.2.70" id="8">(8)</a>. The issue of wages was
						of public health importance in this situation as the poor
						wages of the doctors forced them to work excessively long
						hours, compromising the quality of the medical care they
						offered and their ability to act in the best interest of their
						patients <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Grosskopf I, Buckman G, Garty M. Ethical dilemmas of the doctors' strike in Israel. J Med Ethics. 1985;11:70-71. doi:10.1136/jme.11.2.70" id="8">(8)</a>. In the case of Malta, the low pay of medical
						officers led to problems in recruitment, as new graduates
						left the country to work elsewhere. Also, faced with long
						working hours for low pay, the teaching staff from the
						medical school left the country. As a result of this, the
						General Medical Council derecognised the Malta Medical
						School and the Maltese medical degree also stopped being
						internationally recognised <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frizelle F. Is it ethical for doctors to strike? N Z Med J. 2006 June 23;119(1236):U2037" id="3">(3)</a>. In both examples, what could
						on the surface be characterised as strikes over low pay were
						actually acts to defend public health by preventing further
						collapse of the respective health system.
					</li>

					<p>
						The criterion of just cause often demands a utilitarian
						calculus which demonstrates that ultimately, the beneficial
						repercussions of the strike on the health system would
						outweigh the temporary disruption and suffering caused
						by it. While one may not know for certain that there will
						indeed be any benefits, this criterion places on those
						seeking to strike the burden of stating explicitly how they
						have weighed the risks and the possible benefits of the
						strike action.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the strike action, the doctors must demonstrate the
						right intention, meaning that they should remain faithful
						to their cause and avoid unnecessary destructive acts (or
						imposing unreasonable conditions) that may compromise
						their just cause. Destructive acts and unreasonable
						conditions include refusing to engage in negotiations with
						the employer, vandalism of public property, adding more
						(and often counterproductive) demands, and failing to
						adhere to the conditions set forth at the start of the strike.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>Proportionality:</em> In trying to achieve the just objective of the
						strike, the doctors should not inflict disproportionate harm
						on patients. In other words, unintended "collateral damage"
						resulting from the strike action should be minimised. This
						suggests that doctors on strike should continue to provide
						at least such critical services as emergency care.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Reasonable hope of success:</em> This criterion, which is
						admittedly difficult to apply, ensures that the public's health
						is not disrupted for a futile cause. It prevents irrational resort to strike action, the outcome of which is clearly
						bound to be futile. It entails a considered calculation of the
						probability that the strike action will achieve its intended
						results, ie, of the reasons for thinking that the strike action
						would eventually succeed in bringing about the desired
						change. A recent strike action in Botswana provides an
						example of this. The doctors demanded a pay rise of 16%
						during an economic recession, when the government
						(the employer) was suspending major developmental
						projects and putting on hold the process of hiring new
						public officers. The demand, even if just, had no reasonable
						prospects of succeeding, considering the prevailing
						economic conditions. This example suggests that it would
						be difficult to come up with a general formulation for how
						to determine the "reasonable hope of success", as such a
						judgment must take into account specific contextual issues
						in each case.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Last resort:</em> For a strike to be justified, all less disruptive
						alternatives to a strike action must have been tried and
						failed. The criterion is thus met if the conflict persists despite
						reasonable attempts at less disruptive measures. Such
						methods include advocacy, dissent and even disobedience,
						as suggested by Ogunbanjo <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ogunbanjo GA, van Bogaert DK. Doctors and strike action: Can this be morally justifiable? SA Fam Pract. 2009;51(4):306-8." id="5">(5)</a>.
					</li>

					<li>
						<em>Legitimate authority:</em> The legitimate authorisation of a strike
						action lies with any recognised entity which partly plays
						the role of safeguarding the welfare of doctors. Examples of
						such entities are medical associations and unions. Most of
						these bodies have procedures and processes which ensure
						the participation of their members in decision-making. They
						can thus be reasonably thought to have the legitimacy to
						act on behalf of doctors and project their interest. Giving
						such bodies authority is intended to bring some legal
						legitimacy to strikes and, to some extent, guarantee that
						strikes are used only for just ends. This criterion may also be
						useful in preventing situations in which a group consisting
						of a few militant doctors who claim to represent the
						profession, but who do not actually represent the general
						sentiment of the doctors in the country, declare a strike
						and cause illegitimate harm in the name of the profession.
						The central issue with which this criterion deals is whether
						or not the decision to go on a strike action represents the
						collective view of the majority of doctors. If the criterion is
						met, it suggests that the decision to go on strike represents
						the view held by the majority of doctors, that the cause of
						the proposed strike is just, there is a reasonable hope of
						success, and the condition of last resort has been fulfilled.
					</li>
					<p>
						Evidently this condition will not hold in settings where
						such an authoritative body does not exist. It may also
						not hold in countries where the medical associations
						are repressive and undemocratic, and in settings where
						decisions do not necessarily project the wishes of the
						general membership, but represent the view of a few
						elite doctors instead. Under this criterion, such nonparticipatory,
						non-deliberative medical associations in
						which the voice of the members is not given its rightful
						place cannot count as a legitimate authority.
					</p>

					<li>
						Formal declaration: Before engaging in any strike action,
						the legitimate authority should make a formal public
						declaration of the intended strike. The declaration gives
						the authority an opportunity to delineate for the public
						the moral justification of the strike action. The aspects of
						the justification, as already described, would include (i)
						demonstrating that there is a just cause for the strike and
						showing that it is backed by the right intentions, (ii) an
						argument regarding why the strike action is expected to
						achieve its results, and (iii) demonstrating that the strike
						action is the last resort. The declaration also serves as a
						mechanism to help patients prepare in advance for the
						unsettling effects of the strike, eg, by relocating, stocking
						medication, and booking appointments with alternative
						providers.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>A justification for the criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Those who are already familiar with the traditional just war
					theory would recognise that these criteria borrow heavily
					from that theory. The theory, originally used in the context
					of war, provides a moral calculus for determining the moral
					justifiability of going to war. In 1983, it was enshrined in a
					document, entitled "The Challenge of Peace", adopted by the
					United States Bishops Conference <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The challenge of peace: God's promise and our response&mdash;a pastoral letter on war and peace by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. [Internet]. 1983 May 3 [cited 2013 Oct 26] Available from: http://old.usccb.org/sdwp/international/ TheChallengeofPeace.pdf" id="9">(9)</a>. According to Peter Singer,
					the document has received a good amount of praise, has been
					repeatedly cited as a careful and authoritative statement of the
					theory of just war, and enjoys wide acceptance even beyond
					religious circles <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singer P. The president of good and evil: The ethics of George W Bush. Melbourne, Australia: Text Publishing Company; 2004." id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the just war criteria have already been scrutinised by
					many others and have generally enjoyed such wide acceptance
					in the context of war, I see no need to defend them here, except
					to justify their use in the context of a strike action by doctors.
					Several considerations serve as a justification for applying the
					criteria in the current setting.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Both war and strike action represent a dispute situation in
						which this last-resort, confrontational action is used to force
						the other party to yield to one's demands. In fact, even the
						doctors involved in the strike often refer to their action as a
						fight or a war being waged against the employer.
					</li>

					<li>
						Both actions are disruptive and may result in unintended
						"collateral" damage. These may include the loss of the
						lives of innocent people who may themselves not be
						directly part of the dispute. In acknowledgement of this,
						both doctors and soldiers often make a pledge before
						their confrontational action to do whatever is possible to
						minimise such collateral damage.
					</li>
					<li>
						Both doctors and soldiers are charged with the noble
						duty of preserving life and preventing human suffering.
						A soldier is trained to fight with the ultimate aim of
						safeguarding innocent human lives and peace. It can be
						said that by restoring or defending peace, they play the
						role of preventing human suffering. Similarly, the mission
						of doctors is to prevent and reduce suffering resulting from
						an enemy which, in this case, is disease. The doctor's act of going on strike is similar to the soldier's act of going to war
						as it increases human suffering for some time at least - an
						outcome which, on the surface, would appear to contradict
						the missions of both.
					</li>

				</ol>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>How and when to use the criteria</h4>
				<p>
					Strike action is justified only when all six conditions are
					fulfilled. None can be left out as each represents a safeguard
					mechanism related to an important consideration, as already
					described above. Second, the criteria should be applicable
					whenever a strike by medical doctors is being contemplated.
					The use of the criteria ensures that the general presumption
					against a strike is upheld by forcing the organisers of the strike
					to consider a series of important questions, such as whether
					the cause for going on the strike is just; whether the strike is
					the last resort or have some non-disruptive alternatives been
					left unconsidered; whether in the current circumstances, the
					strike is likely to achieve its objective or would just be a futile
					exercise; whether the declaration of the strike action projects
					the view of the majority of the peers in the profession; and how
					to warn the patients beforehand and finally, how to ensure that
					they are not disproportionately harmed by the strike action.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					This piece has argued for the pragmatic view that strike
					action by doctors that is prima facie unethical may be morally
					justifiable only under six conditions. These are that (i) the
					cause of the strike is just, (ii) the strike action has reasonable
					prospects of success, (iii) it is a last-resort action, (iv) the
					decision to go on strike is taken by a legitimate authority
					representing the doctors, and (v) a formal declaration of the strike is made to the public. The criteria uphold the prima facie
					moral presumption against strikes and do not encourage strike
					actions by doctors, but at the same time, recognise that special
					circumstances may arise which justify a strike.
