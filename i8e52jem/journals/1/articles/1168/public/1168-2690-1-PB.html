					Recent advances in science and technology have brought with them  many questions. One of these, affecting the state of medicine, is the advent of  gene patenting. Patents are a part of a larger subset called 'Intellectual  Property (IP)' which grant monopoly to those with new ideas or knowledge. Legally, a patent is a monopoly granted by the patenting and trademark  organisation of a given country for the use, manufacturing, and sale of an  invention. An invention must meet the criteria of being novel, useful, and  non-obvious for it to be patentable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, an invention is patentable while a discovery is not.  While this rule may, in other areas, appear well defined, in biotechnology, it  is often the cause of differences in regulations between countries. 'Discovery'  is merely making available what already exists in nature. A substance freely  occurring in nature is not patentable. However, if the substance found in  nature must first be isolated from its surroundings, the process for obtaining  it is patentable.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the United States, the first patent law was developed in 1790.  This and other IP rights were formed 'to promote the progress of science and  the useful arts by securing to authors and inventors the exclusive right to  their respective writings and discoveries'. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8(1787)" id="1">(1)</a> David B. Resnik writes,  "The fact is that most industries require sufficient patent protection in  order to secure an adequate return on their research and development  investments. Without this protection, many companies would either protect their  intellectual properties through trade secrecy or they would invest less money  in research and development. Since trade secrecy can have detrimental effects  on the progress of science and medicine, and private investment in research and  development can promote innovation and discovery, it is important to develop  laws and policies that protect intellectual property rights, including property  rights in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Resnik DB.DNA Patents and Human Dignity. Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics 2001; 29:154" id="2">(2)</a>

					Some argue that patenting forces scientists to be secretive about  their data out of fear that others will beat them to the patenting office if  they share their results with the scientific community. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Teitel M. The ownership of life, When patent and value clash. http://www.sustain.org/biotech/library June 1997." id="3">(3)</a> Others hold that  competition can promote research and therefore further science and medicine.  Once patented, the information becomes public knowledge, facilitating the  spread of new discoveries and innovations.

					'Bio-prospecting' is a potential gold mine for both science and  business, since genetic material found in the developing world may yield cures  for diseases as well as cash. What also looms on the horizon is 'bio-piracy',  where corporations use the folk wisdom of indigenous peoples to locate and  understand the use of medicinal plants and then exploit them commercially. DNA  is the core genetic material of all life forms. It is broken up into segments  called genes. Some of these genes code for the proteins in the body that allow  the organism to function. Isolating these genes allows researchers to better  control the proteins. In order for a gene to be patented, it must fulfill the  criteria of being novel, useful, and non-obvious. Robert Cook-Deegan writes,  "The rationale for DNA patenting is - you aren't patenting the gene in  your body or my body. You are taking the gene, you are isolating it, and you  are turning it into a useful form. So for you to get a patent on a fragment of  DNA, you have to prove that you've done something that is new, that is  novel." <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="CNN Specials - Blueprint of the Body: Robert Cook-Deegan, 1999." id="4">(4)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This can be viewed differently. India's Patents Act of 1970 lists  many conditions for which patents cannot apply, including the following:  "The discovery of a new use or new property for a known substance. The  mere re-arrangement of known devices." <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indialawinfo: Patents Act, 1970." id="5">(5)</a> Although the gene is being used  independent of the body, is using it in the laboratory just a new use or re-arrangement  of a known substance?
				</p>
				<p>
					Others argue that patenting genes takes away human beings'  intrinsic ownership over their genes. In the US court case Moore vs. Regents of  the University of California (1990), Dr David Golde patented a cell line,  developed from tissue taken from the cancerous spleen of his patient, Moore.  This became a very valuable research tool; it also had a commercial potential  of $3 billion. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Moore v. Regents of the University of California, 793 P.2d 479 (Cal. 1990)" id="6">(6)</a> When Moore heard of the research, and the patent, he sued  for commercial rights to his own tissue. (3, supra note 3) The court ruled that  Golde violated Moore's right to informed consent but not any property rights to  his own cells. Patenting a gene does not give the patentee ownership of the  gene; only the right to exclude others from 'making, using, selling, offering  for sale, or importing patented items.
				</p>

					In 1990, a US patent applicant tried to patent a cell line derived  from a 26-year-old Guyami Indian woman from Panama. The tribe demanded that the  patent application be withdrawn and the cell line returned to the country of  origin. The United States Commerce Secretary, said, "Under our laws, as  well as those of many countries, subject matter relating to human cells is  patentable." <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bereano PL . The race to own DNA. The Seattle Times, Sunday, August 27, 1995, page B5" id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If DNA is the genetic basis to all life, is life patentable? Life  can be defined on two levels: thermodynamically and consciously. <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Silver, Lee M. Remaking Eden. New York: Avon Books, 1997, 15-18." id="8">(8)</a> The former  is based in the fact that all living things are involved in a constant energy  exchange with their environment. But life can also be defined in terms of  consciousness which gives a living entity its uniqueness. According to the  thermodynamic definition of life, the fertilised egg is alive in the same sense  that cells are alive in donated blood or donated organs. But this single cell  does not represent human life in the special sense. There is a unique conscious  quality that makes a human being alive in a different sense than a fertilised  egg.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some argue that human DNA patents violate human dignity, that they  'treat human beings as having only a market value.'(2, supra note 2) To  commodify an object is to assign it some value. An item that has only market  value is a complete commodity. If it has market value in addition to some other  value, it is an incomplete commodity.(2, supra note 2) Some critics of DNA  patenting argue that human beings are treated as complete commodities. Others  hold that "human DNA patents only treat parts of human beings as complete  commodities; they do not treat whole human beings as complete  commodities."(2, supra note 2) Similarly, some say patenting DNA is like  slavery because it gives the patentee control over another human being's  genetic material. But slave owners both controlled their slaves and owned them.  Patents do not give the patentee rights of ownership, only the right to exclude  others from using the product.

				<h4>How does DNA patenting  affect Indians?</h4>
				<p>
					So far, India does not recognise product patents in  pharmaceuticals - about which the United States and European Union complained  to the Dispute Settlement Board of the WTO. India is required to update its  existing Patent Act of 1970 with legislation for patenting microorganisms (i.e.  DNA) by December 2004. <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Technology Information, Forecasting And Assessment Council. HTTP://WWW.INDIAPATENTS.ORG/ACH/MICRO.HTM Patent Facilitating Center, New Delhi, India" id="9">(9)</a> A joint parliamentary committee is in the process of  drafting recommendations to the second amendment to the Patent Law that will introduce  product patents from 2005. All member countries of the World Trade Organization  must 'apply intellectual property rights to the use of plants, microorganisms,  and other life forms' under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). This act bypasses the patent  system to grant exclusive marketing rights (EMR) as a statutory right to  pharmaceutical and agrochemical transnational corporation (TNCs) India's patent  law on pharmaceuticals allows local manufacturers to sell drugs at about a  third the price of that even in neighboring countries. The new law will give  EMRs at prices unaffordable to most Indians for drugs and agrochemicals for  specified periods in India if they hold single patent in another country. A TNC  now can claim EMRs on formulations based on herbs and plants by making minor  modifications in methods of extraction and processing and then claiming that  they are inventions. However, knowledge of indigenous systems of medicine and  practice are in the public domain and therefore are rights under the  constitutions that can not taken away by enactment.
				</p>

					India is a storehouse of biological resources. In a world that  patents DNA, India must follow current trends to advance its research and  development. In recent years the rise in investment in biotech-oriented  industries is poised to take India to a different level in the world market.  However, western nations are at an advantage in research given their better  technological and financial resources. India's Technology Information,  Forecasting, and Assessment Council discussed this issue recently: "If  microorganisms isolated form the nature for the first time are considered  patentable, then minerals and ores discovered from the interior of the earth  and the deep sea bed would qualify for patenting. The isolation will call for a  much higher class of technology and large financial resources. Obviously,  countries having such resources will have a very distinct advantage and smaller  countries may have the risk of losing their own resources if the ores and  minerals are allowed to be patented." <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Technology Information, Forecasting And Assessment Council. HTTP://WWW.INDIAPATENTS.ORG/ACH/MICRO.HTM Patent Facilitating Center, New Delhi, India" id="9">(9)</a> Vandana Shiva discusses the  dangers of losing rights over cell lines indigenous to India. She illustrates  this with the example of the neem tree. Over centuries, Indians have used 'the  neem datun (toothbrush) to protect their teeth with its medicinal and  anti-bacterial properties.' Since 1985, however, many US and Japanese firms  have taken out patents on formulas for neem-based solutions. She quotes Science  magazine: "Squeezing bucks out of the neem ought to be relatively  easy." <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shiva, Vandana. Biopiracy. The Plunder of Nature and Knowledge. South End Press. Boston, MA. 1997." id="10">(10</a>, pg. 69-70) Similarly, she sees the patenting of genes unique to  certain indigenous people as taking their land. <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shiva, Vandana. Biopiracy. The Plunder of Nature and Knowledge. South End Press. Boston, MA. 1997." id="10">(10</a>, pg. 3) However, if Indians  patent things native to India through their own research, scientific  advancement involving Indians can remain in the country.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					As scientific research advances, more patents of human DNA and  cell lines will emerge, as will many fundamental questions on human life for  which there are no 'correct' answers. Efforts must be made to understand the  legal, social, scientific, clinical, and psychological effects of patenting  genetic material. Patenting can help further scientific development by making  research public knowledge. However, research cannot occur without financial and  technological resources, putting developing nations such as India at a  disadvantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indians also risk losing monopoly over scientific advancements  involving indigenous people, plants, and animals. Hence, they must be able to  apply for patents in their own country, enabling them to have monopoly and  financial rights over their own scientific findings. India must choose between  the more conservative European approach and the US or some other approach for  the needs of its emerging economy. Indian companies, inventors, investors and  physicians venturing into the biotech sector must be well informed and aware of  domestic and international laws as they seek to join the biotechnology  competition.
