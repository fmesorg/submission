					The  economic prosperity following the Second World War led to a dramatic growth in  the American health-care industry. By the 1970s, Americans outspent everyone  else on health care. Yet, most public health indicators showed that US lagged  behind most industrialised countries and up to one in five Americans had to  rely on charity to get their health care. When governmental efforts failed to  check the growth of spending on health care, the market responded with a system  that came to be called Managed Care (MC). <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mamdani B and Mamdani M. Managed Care in the USA: history and structure. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9:120-122." id="1">(1)</a> Driven by a motive to contain  costs, many of the changes have had a profound negative impact on patients,  hospitals, medical education and research.

				<h4>Impact of managed care on patients</h4>
				<p>
					By 1995,  the rising cost of health care had mostly eliminated free health insurance as a  benefit of employment. Not only were most employees now under some form of MC;  they were also paying for an increasing share of the cost of insurance. Today,  younger and healthier patients have much higher out-of-pocket expenses as they  are paying a greater share of the premium. But older, sicker patients actually  pay less than they did before: apart from a flat premium there are no  additional costs. However there are greater hassles. Patients have less choice  in the selection of their physician and hospital. Their access to emergency  room care is restricted and they often have to wait longer for appointments. A  specialist visit requires prior approval and not all treatments, procedures or  drugs, are available. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37." id="2">(2)</a> A change in job often means a change in physicians.  This further compromises care of the sicker patient with chronic disease in  need of coordinated care.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the  positive side, patients enrolled with good managed care organisations (MCOs)  receive far more preventive care than they ever received under the  fee-for-service (FFS) system. Patients with chronic diseases such as heart  failure, diabetes and asthma probably get better coordinated care under  case-management protocols often overseen by nurse practitioners. Previously a  50-year-old with hypertension, diabetes, arthritis and post-infarction seizures  went to four different specialists. Under managed care, these visits are  combined into just one visit to the primary care physician (PCP). A specialist  is involved only when necessary.

				<h4>Impact of managed care on physicians</h4>
				<p>
					Until the  early 1990s most physicians were in solo practice or worked in small groups. As  MCOs transferred costs to physicians through capitation arrangements, solo  practitioners could not absorb the financial risk. Economics thus forced  physicians either to work as salaried employees of the MCO or join large  physician groups, with an inevitable loss of autonomy. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37.!" id="2">(2)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  therefore not surprising that most surveys of physicians show discontent and  dissatisfaction. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kassirer JP. Doctor discontent. N Engl J Med 1998; 339:1543-1545." id="3">(3)</a> The loss of autonomy, the increased administrative burden  that physicians view as unproductive, and the reduced income are the major  reasons. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Simon SR, Pan RJD, Sullivan AM, et al. Views of managed care. N Engl J Med 1999; 928-946." id="4">(4)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  the wording of survey questions and the bias of the researcher also have an  impact on the conclusions. Authors often focus on the minority of physicians  who are dissatisfied. Most survey data suggest that physician discontent is  more with the (for-profit) MCO rather than the philosophy of managed care per  se. It is therefore quite likely that if managed care were presented  differently, such as under a not-for-profit, single payer system, physicians may  change their attitudes. Indeed, in a survey of more than 100,000 medical  students, interns, residents, and faculty, Simon et al found that though most  respondents rated FFS superior to MC in terms of access to care, ethical  conflicts, and the quality of patient-physician relationship, more than 30 % of  the respondents rated MC superior to FFS for chronic care. When a single payer  option was added in, most preferred a single payer system over either MC or  FFS. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Simon SR, Pan RJD, Sullivan AM, et al.

				<h4>Impact of managed care on community hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Hospitals  of antiquity were primarily shelters for the dying poor. The first general  hospital in America to care for sick people was established in the 18th  century. After World War II, the federal government provided generous subsidies  for the construction of community hospitals across the nation. While initially  hospitals were modelled on the British system where any credentialed physician  could admit and take care of her/his patient, under MC they are increasingly  shifting to the European model of salaried 'hospitalists' caring for patients  referred by PCPs practising exclusively in the outpatient clinic. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iglehart JK. Community hospitals. N Engl J Med 1993; 329: 372-376." id="5">(5)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Under MC,  community hospitals are increasingly losing their links to their community. To  maximise cost-containment, MCOs are acquiring or contracting with the lower  cost community hospitals in preference to high-cost teaching hospitals. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37." id="2">(2)</a> As  community leaders are replaced by MCO-appointed trustees and physicians, the  links with the neighbourhood are lost. Many free-standing community hospitals  wishing to retain their independence, share risks and improve their bargaining  position with MCOs, have joined networks of local, regional or national health  systems. This further compromises the role and control of the local community  in their community hospital.
				</p>

				<h4>Impact of managed care on academic medicine</h4>
				<p>
					Academic  medical centres typically consist of a large tertiary care hospital with an  attached medical school. The hospital is staffed by the medical school faculty.  Although providing only 18 % of the nation's acute care beds, the major  teaching hospitals provide half of all charity care. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iglehart JK. Rapid changes for academic medical centers- second of two parts. N Engl J Med 1995; 332:407-412." id="6">(6)</a> Under the FFS system,  private insurance and government paid the higher per diem charges of the  academic medical centre: an implicit subsidy for graduate medical education,  research and charity care.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the  advent of MC with its emphasis on cost-containment, MCOs are preferentially  contracting with community hospitals rather than the more expensive academic  medical centres. They refuse to subsidise medical education and research and  are averse to paying for charity care for the 20% of the population that is  uninsured. MCOs also demand a much greater time commitment of the academic  physician to clinical activities rather than teaching and research. Thus,  under managed care, academic centres lose revenues, staff time for teaching and  research, and the patient population necessary to sustain medical education and  research.
				</p>
				<p>
					To  counter the trend, academic medical centres are creating their own networks  with community-based physicians, a breed looked down on in the past. To  attract more patients, some have offered medical services at a discount or for  a global fee. The academic centres have also pressed for the creation of  separate funds for teaching, research, and charity care to which all payers,  insurance companies as well as government would be required to contribute, but  this is unlikely to happen soon. James A. Lane, a senior vice president  of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a large non-profit MCO, said, "We  believe that education and research are public goods, and they should be paid  for with public funds." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Iglehart JK.

				<h4>Impact of managed care on health care quality</h4>
				<p>
					Quality  means different things to different people. To PCPs committed to evidence-based  care, quality is judged by adherence to practice guidelines. To patients,  quality is measured by how promptly they were seen and how satisfied they felt  at the end of their encounter. Problems with quality of health care can be  categorised as overuse, under-use, and misuse. Under-use is prevalent in the  care of patients with chronic disease. For instance, many patients with  diabetes do not have regular glycosylated haemoglobin measurements and retinal  examinations. Under-use also occurs in acute care, e.g. a failure to use  aspirin in myocardial infarction. Misuse is a pervasive problem. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T. The movement for improved quality in health care. N Engl J Med 1999; 340:488-492." id="7">(7)</a> Primarily  concerned with reducing costs and maximising profits, reducing overuse had  become the main focus of MCOs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  National Center for Quality Assurance (NCQA) was formed in 1979 by physicians  seeking to improve medical care. In 1990, MC trade associations, hoping to fend  off federal monitoring of health plans and to reduce competition from newer  HMOs, engineered a restructuring of the NCQA's board. Now the NCQA has two main  voluntary activities: the accreditation of HMOs and the publication of measures  of performance, HEDIS (Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set). <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T. The movement for improved quality in health care. N Engl J Med 1999; 340:488-492." id="7">(7)</a> Though most employers do not insist on NCQA accreditation as yet, 30 large  corporations and the federal government will not contract with health plans  that are not accredited by the NCQA. Ironically, although employers tend to  associate higher quality with lower costs (achieved by reducing overuse and  misuse), the NCQA's HEDIS measures focus mainly on the under-use of health  care, the correction of which raises costs. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T. The movement for improved quality in health care. N Engl J Med 1999; 340:488-492." id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					As a  result of pressure from physician activists who persuaded large employers and  the government to demand high-quality care from MC plans, MCOs are now paying  attention to under-use as well as overuse. More than half of the MCOs have  chronic disease management programmes in place. More than 80% monitor  patient satisfaction and most also measure outcomes on a regular basis. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37." id="2">(2)</a> Almost all HMOs have implemented practice guidelines, performance measures and  improved information infrastructure. Most have written standards for  medical records and two-third use standardised problem lists. Most review  records for accuracy and provide feedback to physicians. Some even use results  of quality improvement studies at the time of renegotiating contracts with  individual physicians. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37." id="2">(2)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  true assessment of quality requires independent verification: this is sadly  lacking. Indirect evidence suggests that current quality assurance  activities have yet to achieve significant improvement in outcomes. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gold M. The changing US health care system: challenges for responsible public policy. Milbank Quarterly 1999; 77: 3-37." id="2">(2)</a>

				<h4>Impact of managed care on health-care spending</h4>
				<p>
					Health-care  spending consists of the actual cost of providing health care, administrative  costs and surplus profits of the MCOs. Under MC, the actual cost of providing  health care has decreased. <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sullivan K. On the 'efficiency' of managed care plans. Health Affairs 2000; 19:139-148." id="8">(8)</a> Factors contributing to the reduction include  reduced hospital stay, lower payments to doctors, lower pharmaceutical charges,  reduced use of tests due to adherence to practice guidelines and utilisation  review, physician reimbursement policies that penalise those ordering excessive  tests and selective enrollment ('cherry picking') of younger, healthier  persons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Few HMOs  report administrative costs separately. One of the few reports available is  from the state of Minnesota. <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Weinick RM and Cohen JW. Leveling the playing field: managed care enrollment and hospitals use, 1987-1996. Health Affairs 2000; 19: 178-184." id="9">(9)</a> In most industries increased productivity  results in a reduction in administrative costs. However, in Minnesota, from  1980 to 1991, the increase in MCOs' administrative expenditure was more than  twice the increase in enrollment and consequent medical care expense.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  therefore seems that the health insurance industry entered managed care mainly  to increase its profits by 'managing' patients, hospitals and the  pharmaceutical industry. Because of their large size, MCOs were able to force  patients to accept less health care and physicians and hospitals to accept  lower fees. They also recruited younger, healthier patients who needed less  care. They also successfully lobbied the government to protect them from law  suits. More recently patient complaints to the media and the legislatures has  forced MCOs to reverse some of their excesses such as 'drive-by deliveries' and  'gate-keeper' functions limiting patient access to health care and thus raising  costs for MCOs. At the same time, corporate resistance to increasing premiums  has severely limited MCO profitability. In 1997, only half the MCOs reported a  profit. and the average profit margin was a meagre 1.2%. As there is a finite  limit to which health insurance premiums can be raised, the future of  for-profit MCOs is uncertain. Will the marketplace find a  solution?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Legal challenges to managed care</h4>
				<p>
					Under the  FFS system, disputes between the patient and the insurance company are resolved  under contract law that governs voluntary agreements between two legally  competent parties. Law courts and legislatures intervene only when an agreement  is felt to be excessively one-sided or violates some principle of public  policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disputes  between the patient and physician/hospital fall in the realm of tort law. <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jacobsen PD and Patil NM. Managed care litigation: legal doctrine at the boundary of tort and contract. Medical Care Research and Review 2000; 57: 440-463." id="10">(10)</a> Tort law covers three basic areas &mdash; compensation, deterrence, and  accountability &mdash; and establishes the legal standards of care. Physicians are  expected to provide the same care to all patients irrespective of payment  arrangements. Most cases are heard in state courts and governed by rules  established by legislatures in each state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under  FFS, when an insurance company denied payment for care already delivered, it  only affected payment of a bill. More often than not, the patient  received the care needed. However, under MC, where the insurance company  also provides care, denial of the benefit now includes both denials of care and  of funds. Contract law defines the market mechanisms while tort law establishes  medical accountability. Clearly, the issues under the new system of health-care  delivery overlap aspects of both contract and tort law.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  passing the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974 the US  Congress exempted MCOs from lawsuits in state courts. To the extent that  medical malpractice falls under state courts, ERISA granted MCOs immunity from  lawsuits under tort law. Subsequently federal courts have generally focused  only on the contractual role of MCOs as financiers and have ignored the  health-care provider function which would have been considered under tort law.  Thus MCOs have escaped medical malpractice lawsuits. In response to public  outcry, lawmakers have been considering several measures designated as 'right  to sue' laws to protect patient rights. Lawmakers have been trying to develop  legislation that would protect the cost-containment provided by MCOs while  allowing legal challenges to quality of care. So far, no satisfactory  compromise has emerged. Even in absence of legislative action, it is  quite likely that, as courts improve their understanding of how health care has  changed under MC, many of the protections under ERISA will vanish. Even judges  agree that ERISA goes too far in protecting MCOs. <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jacobsen PD and Patil NM. Managed care litigation: legal doctrine at the boundary of tort and contract. Medical Care Research and Review 2000; 57: 440-463." id="10">(10)</a> Physicians, to protect  their economic interests and professional autonomy, have challenged economic  credentialing, selective contracting, etc., and have tried to use anti-trust  laws to gain entry to physician panels of MCOs. The courts have so far  sanctioned the use of economic credentialing and selective contracting. An area  where physicians have had some success involves due process in deselecting a  physician from any MCO panel. <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jacobsen, PD.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Managed  care today is dominated by for-profit organisations whose primary interest is  to maximise profits and who would go to great length to assure this. However,  non-profit health insurance based on a capitated MC network model with a strong  emphasis on utilisation review, has the potential to improve quality.  Corporate purchasers of health insurance could make informed decisions based on  HEDIS quality and outcome data. With an emphasis on prevention and the ability  to collect data on population-based samples to guide management of chronic  disease, health care could be improved significantly.
