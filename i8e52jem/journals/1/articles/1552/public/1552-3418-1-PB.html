				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					In developing  countries the demands of laparoscopic surgery on the entire operating team are  indeed heavy. Financial stringency imposes a burden which calls for reserves of  equanimity, determination and commitment to one's belief in the benefits of  laparoscopic surgery. Every avenue of innovation and ingenuity has to be  explored to ensure that the optimal result can be achieved at minimal cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					The thrust of laparoscopic surgery has snowballed  with almost blinding, incomprehensible speed and volume. Propelled by the  aggressive enterpreneurship of instrument manufacturers, who found in  laparoscopic surgery an el Dorado beyond their wildest dreams, forced by  patient demand and advocated by pioneering surgeons with missionary if not  fundamentalist zeal, there is no organ or tissue in the abdomen &ndash; both intra-and extra-peritoneal &ndash; which has not faced the impact of this surgery. The  hurricane of laparoscopic surgery hit, gripped and convulsed the developing  world with the same intensity as anywhere else.
				</p>
				<p>
					All over the world, and especially in  developing countries, there is need and room for circumspection. Just because  laparoscopic cholecystectomy is such a runaway success does not necessarily  mean that all open surgery must be discarded. Never before in the history of  surgery has surgical decision making been influenced so greatly by media hype,  the thrust of instrument manufacturers and corporate bodies, patient demand  often based on distorted information and a trend towards surgical one-upmanship if not gimmickry. It is imperative for surgeons in developing  countries to evaluate and decide which laparoscopic procedures give real  benefit to their patients as compared to the open procedure in terms of safety,  efficacy, applicability and cost-effectiveness, in other words to decide what  is truly beneficial surgery for the patient and what could be a circus act for  the performing surgeon.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is required of us as surgical scientists  and custodians of our patients' welfare to evaluate and appraise every  laparoscopic procedure not in terms of enthusiastic or even euphoric personal  achievement, but rather as a pragmatic clinical study as it applies to our own  conditions. To avoid pushing laparoscopic surgery to illogical extremes, one  should temper the wizardry of the laparoscopic surgeon and the inventiveness of  the instrument manufacturer with the wisdom of what Ogilvy wrote over 50 years  ago, "There seems to be a tendency to look at change as synonymous with  advance. Advance means progress to something better and not progress to  something new," and St. Paul's advice, 2000 years ago, "Prove all things and  hold fast to that which is good."

				<h4>Training for  laparoscopic surgery</h4>
				<p>
					Laparoscopic surgery is a completely different ball game from conventional  surgery which offers wide exposure, tissue contact, binocular vision and the  use of traditional equipment. It, thus, demands specialised training. The  problems of training are further compounded by the fact that, hitherto,  training has to be imparted as a 'crash course' to surgeons in active practice,  unlike the training in conventional surgery over four or five years based on  the traditional principles of hands-on apprenticeship as laid down by William  S. Halsted.
				</p>
				<p>
					So far, this training has no basis of  uniformity or standardisation and varies from centre to centre, country to  country. Most of the early training in the developing countries was in the form  of workshops lasting for two to five days. These early workshops were  intensive, over eight to twelve hours a day and included
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						didactic lectures not only on practical points but on contraindications, complications and solutions to problem situations.
					</li>
					<li>
						video-sessions depicting both correct technique and complications.
					</li>
					<li>
						trainer model practice. Practice on the trainer on a regular basis, for weeks after the workshop, is imperative for the serious laparoscopic surgeon to master eye-hand coordination and basic laparoscopic techniques.
					</li>
					<li>
						closed-circuit T. V. demonstrations of laparoscopic procedures
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					With time the teaching programmes expanded to  include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						journal review and book exhibition. This is the weakest link in training in developing countries.
					</li>
					<li>
						diagnostic laparoscopy This is the most significant training medium, imparting training in the basics of laparoscopy and giving eye-hand co-ordination on the best trainer-model as yet available - a live human.
					</li>
					<li>
						animal laboratories and surgical-skills centres A large thrust of laparoscopic surgery training in the U. S. and elsewhere is based on animal laboratory work. As a faculty member of a surgical-skills laboratory in Bombay I find that these animal laboratories are very expensive to maintain, serve a limited purpose in the developing world, and are far from being cost-effective. More damaging, after work on three animals over a few hours, many have a sense of unjustified confidence in their ability and even leave with a 'certificate' to bolster their morale. Employed as the main method of training this is dangerous and inadequate. These centres would have considerable value and benefit if integrated into an ongoing, comprehensive, residency training programme.
					</li>
					<li>
						hands-on apprenticeship. Short workshops are almost entirely being replaced by a return to the time-proven Halstedian method of surgical training. This hands-on training is invariably combined with work on the trainer model and diagnostic laparoscopy.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The combination is adequate to train quality  laparoscopic surgeons. The real problem for such training in the developing  world is that teaching hospitals, by and large, have not entered the field of  laparoscopic surgery and laparoscopic surgery training for residents is  unfortunately available in a minority of teaching hospitals. The bulk of hands-on training is done in private hospitals both for residents as also for  surgeons who visit for three-to four-week programmes. Fortunately, with a  reduction in the cost of equipment this trend is changing and it is to be hoped  that prolonged apprenticeship in laparoscopic surgery will be an integral part  of surgical training in all teaching hospitals and a pre-requisite for post-graduation.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have found crash courses unsatisfactory and  now recommend apprenticeship along the same lines as that required for training  in any other branch of surgery, ensuring that the above points are attended to.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Three essentials for  laparoscopic surgery</h4>
				<p>
					In our training programmes we emphasise three essentials for laparoscopic  surgery in developing countries:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Safety,
					</li>
					<li>
						Economy
					</li>
					<li>
						Care of instruments.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Not  surprisingly these are inter-connected. Safety ensures complication-free  surgery, which ensures economy. Economy ensures the growth and spread of  laparoscopic surgery in our part of the world. Instrument care ensures both  safety and economy. Every trainee starts his day setting up and connecting the  equipment and ends his day cleaning the instruments with a tooth-brush or  water jet, drying them and packing them for gas sterilisation. The rewards of  meticulous instrument care are munificent: we have our cold light cables,  telescopes, cameras and hand instruments in active use for years.
				</p>

				<h4>Advanced laparoscopic  training</h4>
				<p>
					Laparoscopic surgery is no different from any other surgery. The ideal  progression from one procedure to the rest should be after mastering each  progressively advanced procedure before venturing to the next. This is how  residents have been trained in the past. We recommend the following steps:  diagnostic laparoscopy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic  appendicectomy, laparoscopic repair of hernia, laparoscopic surgery for peptic  ulcer disease, laparoscopic bowel surgery, laparoscopic solid organ surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					An essential qualification for graduating to  advanced laparoscopic procedures is mastering of suturing and knotting, these  attributes bring laparoscopic surgery to the level of good open surgery.  Following the lead given by Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic  Surgeons and European Association of Endoscopic Surgeons, several national  laparoscopic surgery societies in developing countries are trying to  standardise basic patterns of training for laparoscopic surgery. Proving  credentials is altogether a different problem. In the current situation where  laxity of regulations prevails, there is no way we can enforce or meaningfully  implement minimum standards that must be met. However, with growing patient  awareness and consumer-rights consciousness, surgeons in their own interest  may themselves soon request acceptable verification of their credentials.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Guidelines for training  in and practising laparoscopy</h4>
				<p>
					Bearing in mind the above principles, we have formulated the following  guidelines. In establishing practice guidelines, the overriding concern is that  safety is not sacrificed in the process of introducing new procedures. To  ensure safety, it is necessary to outline what we consider being the minimum  standards of acceptable practice related to training, practice and equipment.  The Indian Association of Gastrointestinal Endo-Surgeons has taken into  account the fact that surgeons to whom the guidelines are directed are  responsible and competent general surgeons who:
				</p>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>
						understand the pathophysiology of the  organs being operated on.
					</li>
					<li>
						have adequate experience in the range of alternative medical and surgical  therapies.
					</li>
					<li>
						have adequate experience and mastery over open surgery
					</li>
					<li>
						have adequate experience in diagnostic laparoscopy
					</li>
					<li>
						are aware of their limitations.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					Trainees should attain the above basic  criteria before embarking on or learning operative laparoscopic techniques.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Training</h4>
				<p>
					The accepted principle  in training for laparoscopy is that the trainee is familiar with the  instrumentation in use, has attained an acceptable level of hand-eye  coordination and is comfortable with a video camera attached where it is used.  Before these basic skills are mastered no surgery should be allowed on human  patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					These basic skills are best mastered during  the endotrainer sessions and if facilities are available on animate models.  Workshops offering adequate hands-on experience of this nature are  recommended. While the learning curve varies greatly, 20 hours is usually  adequate. The alternative to these sessions would be longer periods of  apprenticeship to experienced laparoscopic surgeons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having mastered basic laparoscopic techniques  a structured preceptorship through the various levels of difficulty to be  outlined is essential.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Preceptorship</h4>
				<p>
					There shall be four  levels for training. Such training will consist of matters referred to in the  Annexe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clinicians entering the preceptorship scheme  for training at Level 2 should demonstrate :-
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						capability in management of surgical cases in the traditional manner,
					</li>
					<li>
						ability to operate competently at Level 1 with at least 20 cases logged as  assistant and 20 cases logged as principal surgeon.
					</li>

				</ol>
				<p>
					Attainment of competence at Level 2 should be  certified by the preceptor (s) only after completion of the minimum  requirements:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						acting as assistant in 20 cases,
					</li>
					<li>
						logging 20 cases operating under supervision of a recognised laparoscopic  surgeon (preceptor).
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					Training at Level 3 should be embarked upon  only after the clinician has proficiently performed on his own.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Training and the grant  of credentials</h4>
				<p>
					Hospitals owe it to their patients to exercise due care in the selection of the  physicians allowed to practice under its jurisdiction. To assist the various  hospitals' committees that grant credentials, it is recommended that in the  initial phase operating rights at the appropriate level be granted only to  surgeons who are able to show documentary proof of their ability having logged  the minimum requirements at the relevant level. Acceptable proof should include
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						histology reports,
					</li>
					<li>
						unedited video-recordings of operations,
					</li>
					<li>
						certificates from recognised preceptors.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					The onus is on clinicians who have already  achieved a degree of competence and are currently practicing in the various  hospitals to satisfy their respective Medical Advisory Boards as to their  abilities.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Choice of preceptors</h4>
				<p>
					As a general rule preceptors should be :
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						recognised as operative laparoscopic surgeons by their peers,
					</li>
					<li>
						competent in both theory and practice,
					</li>
					<li>
						able and willing to pass on their skills.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Implementation</h4>
				<p>
					It is recommended that  the spirit and letter of the guidelines be adhered to in training and credentialling  exercises.
				</p>
			</div>
