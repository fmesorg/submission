			<h4>Basics of such a scheme</h4>
			<p>
				Patients sue their doctors principally to gain sums of money as  compensation for damage done to than. The victims of such litigation suffer  considerably when they are innocent. One consequence of this sorry state of  affairs has been the practice of 'defensive medicine', which, in turn, imposes  worsening burdens in terms of escalating costs of investigation and therapy on  the patients themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another important consequence patients who suffer damage for whom  no one can be held liable (as when the harm follows medical accident rather  than negligence) have no recourse to compensation at present.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some countries are experimenting with a system of 'liability  without fault'.Here,compensation is sought and granted on the basis of extent  of damage irrespective of its cause and is related to the need of the  patient.At one stroke,this relievevs the doctors and the court of litigations  and ensures that the majority suffering the consequences of medical acccident  also recieves help.Instead of having to prove malpractice by an individual  evidence of harm would suffice.Inevitably, if the state has to pay the current  trend towards a massive compensation awards would be reserved
			</p>
			<p>
				Such a system necesitates the setting up of a fund for ths  specifiic purpose using contributions by the state, the medical profession  insurance agencies philanthropic institutions an community at large.
			</p>
			<p>
				Why should the medical profession contribute? The system outlined  above would bar all civil proceedings which relate to damages arising from  personal injury and death by accident,misadventure and negligence. The benefits  to doctors in the form of peace of mind, ability to concentrate on treatment of  the patient and savings in settlements provide sufficient reasons.
			</p>

			<h4>Some Caveats</h4>
			<p>
				The Accident Compensation Scheme of New Zealand restricted such  compensation to personal injury by accident including medical, surgical, dental  or first aid misadventures but excluded damage caused by sickness, disease or  the ageing process.
			</p>
			<p>
				This has been disputed. Since the aim is to help all those in  need, to exclude those handicapped as a natural consequence seems unfair. On  the other hand, the funds needed to help all those handicapped by accident or  ill health will be enormous and may be beyond available resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				The individual patient will gain less money from such a system.  The more equitable distribution of money to all those in need, based on the  extent of need should, however, be generally welcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				A review of decisions in New Zealand under the Accident  Compensation Scheme shows that patients suffering harm from failure to diagnose  or treat accurately, risks known to the doctor but not to the patient and  failure by the doctor to provide sufficient information to permit the patient  to make an autonomous decision were not compensated. Thus, in practice, sonic  forms of medical negligence were not covcrcd, lending themselves to action in  courts of law. Here, the principle (based on common sense and natural justice) that where an injury is caused which should never have been caused, compensation should be paid by the person causing such harm has been applied.
			</p>

			<h4>Is such a system  feasible in India?</h4>
			<p>
				The answer depends on the extent to which society and the medical  profession are willing to bear the financial burden. The medical and legal  professions, social service agencies and the population at large would do well  to ponder this alternative to the present system that sows the seeds of  distrust and antagonism between patient and doctor.
