					Reflections on  Freedom to choose. <em>Dying with dignity. Voluntary euthanasia</em> <strong>Dr. B. N.  Colabawalla Mumbai: Society For The Right To Die With Dignity. 2001. 40 pages.  Paperback. Rs. 40.00.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>(Copies may be obtained from Dr. Colabawalla at A-3, Ben  Nevis, Bhulabhai Desai Road, Mumbai 400026.)</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Colabawalla is an urological surgeon of distinction who  retired as a professor at the Grant Medical College and St. George Hospital,  Mumbai. He later set up the department of urological surgery at the Jaslok Hospital  and Research Centre. As part of his second career, he serves the Society For  The Right To Die With Dignity and is currently its Chairperson.
				</p>
				<p>
					He has dedicated this slim book to Mr. Minoo Masani. The  late Mr. Masani's many qualities of the mind and heart are well known to many  and the dedication reflects Dr. Colabawalla's admiration for him. As with Mr.  Masani, so with Dr. Colabawalla - the spade is a spade and not an implement  meant to turn the earth over.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inside cover of the book provides an all-too-brief  glimpse of some of the facets of Dr. Colabawalla's life and work. The prefatory  note outlines the scope of the book and states the reason for addressing the  Indian audience differently from those in the West.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eight sections follow, ranging from perspectives on living  and dying to Dr. Colabawalla's personal epilogue. These sections take the  reader by the arm, gently but firmly, steering clear of ambiguity and lack of  reason. The joy of living is emphasised, as is the inevitability of death. A distinction  is made between measures taken to save life and those that merely prolong  death. The tragic aspects of modern medical high technology have been  highlighted.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Colabawalla provides the reader an understanding of his  own reasoning and traces logically the means by which he has reached his own  decisions on dying with dignity, the freedom to choose how he would like to die  and when it may be necessary for the medical profession or others to help a  person die.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no attempt at skirting delicate issues. Matters of  philosophy and religion are treated with dignity and discussed without passion.  The generation of light, not heat has been the motive in the production of this  volume. I commend it. It will help you come to terms with issues not commonly  discussed. It may help you overcome prejudice and open your mind to further  thought. The interested reader may wish to obtain a copy of the eight-page  booklet describing the need for us to write a living will. It provides a model  will, which can be modified by the individual reader. It is available from the  address noted above.
