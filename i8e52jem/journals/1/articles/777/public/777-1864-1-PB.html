					Laparoscopic  or 'minimally invasive' surgery has become the gold standard procedure in  cholecystectomy, fundoplication and adrenelectomy and has major advantages in  appendicectomy and for diagnosis of pain/mass of unknown origin in the abdomen.  However, because of its mass acceptance by patients and surgeons, there are  some ethical issues which need to be addressed. 'When an innovative treatment  is introduced into clinical practice, rigorous testing is mandatory for the  protection of individual patients and the just use of limited resources. This  holds true with greater force in the light of evidence that many innovations  show no advantage over existing treatments when they are subjected to properly  controlled study' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Triodl H, Spitzer WO, McPeek B et al.

				<h4>Informed consent for  laparoscopic surgery</h4>
				<p>
					Consent  for an operation usually requires an explanation of the indications, principles  and risk of the procedure, as well as the consequences of not undergoing the  proposed surgery and the discussion of alternative treatments. In a study by  postal questionnaire to 207 surgeons who were asked to estimate how often they  mentioned the nine given complications (bile duct injury, retained calculi,  port site hernia, shoulder tip pain, conversion to open cholecystectomy, wound  infection, respiratory complications, thromboembolic complica-tions and death)  to patients while obtaining consent for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it was  seen that on an average, only 3 of the 9 complications were mentioned to the  patients more than 50% of the time. Twenty-five per cent never discussed bile  duct injury with patients and 22% mentioned it only rarely. Fifty-nine per cent  rarely or never informed the patient of the risk of retained calculi, 30% never  mentioned shoulder tip pain, 70% never mentioned port site hernia and 90% never  or rarely mentioned operative mortality <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="McManus PL, Wheatley KE. Consent and complications: risk disclosure varies widely between individual surgeons. Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2003;85:79-82." id="2">(2)</a>. This study highlights the fact  that patients need to be better informed before undergoing minimally invasive  procedures, particularly about potential risks. Most surgeons do not provide  written information to the patient about the procedure and conversion rate.

				<h4>Learning curve of  laparoscopic procedures</h4>
				<p>
					Laparoscopic  surgery has a learning curve during which the risk of complications are  relatively higher, with longer time for the procedure resulting in increased  cost. On a study on 56 specialist registrars in general surgery on the use and  teaching of laparoscopic appendicectomy, it was seen that 43% had performed a  laparoscopic appendicectomy (with an average of 2.5 supervised by a consultant  and 7.5 with a more junior assistant). Of these, 92% had been taught by a  consultant, but only 31% of the consultants for whom they were currently  working had done appendicectomy laparoscopically, and laparoscopic  appendicetomy was only being performed in 14% of the specialist registrars'  current firm. The study concluded that dedicated consultant time for  emergencies would facilitate teaching of laparoscopic appendicectomy but  theatre time, costs of disposable instruments, and the inexperience of many  consultants in this operation are likely to continue limiting its practice <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Noble H, Gallagher P, Campbell WB. Who is doing laparoscopic appendicectomies and who taught them? Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2003;85:331-33." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was  seen that a greater learning curve was required by consultants-who seldom  acknowledged it. There was also competition between fellow consultants  regarding conversion rate, time required for completion of the procedure and  discharge from hospital. All these personal issues and egos sometimes put the  patients' lives into jeopardy.
				</p>

				<h4>Indications for  laparoscopic surgery</h4>
				<p>
					With  the advent of laparoscopic procedures which lead to less pain, small scars,  early discharge and return to work, and fewer analgesics, indications of  selection of patients undergoing such procedures have been expanded, which is  of questionable ethics. Causes of most patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy  for asymptomatic gallstones need scrutiny. The natural history of asymptomatic  gallstones suggests that a large number of affected individuals will remain  asymptomatic through life and only 1%-4% per year will develop symptoms or  complications of gallstone disease. Thus, ultrasound-detected coincidental  gallstones require only watchful waiting; surgery is generally not recommended <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meshkhes AW. Asymptomatic gallstones in the laparoscopic era. J R Coll Surg Edinb 2002;47;742-48." id="4">(4)</a>. However, surgeons rarely show patience whenever a patient has an  ultrasound report of cholelithiasis. This is now common because of master  health check-ups conducted at various hospitals. The whole concept of  laparoscopic surgery requires a 'relook' in such conditions.

				<h4>Disposable laparoscopic  instruments!</h4>
				<p>
					All  laparoscopic surgeries demand the use of disposable instruments but their  exorbitant cost in developing countries such as India leads to the reuse of  these instruments until they 'wear out'. Another issue which requires  considerable attention is the sterilisation of such instruments. In a study  from the US hospitals where more than 466 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were  performed, it was found that they did not know the logistics of reuse or its  costs and risks. The survey also recorded that the reusable laparoscopic  instruments were sterilised 'the same way everytime'. Most of the surgeons,  however, did indicate that a simple comparison of the purchase price of  reusable instruments with that of disposable instruments was not adequate to  make an informed judgement about which instruments would be the most  cost-effective <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cahill N. Reusable versus disposable laparoscopic instruments. Bull Am Coll Surg 1993;78:28-29." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  necessary to have some guidelines and protocols for reuse of laparoscopic  instruments and their proper sterilisation and maintenance.

				<h4>Ethics of innovative  surgery</h4>
				<p>
					In a  survey of 59 articles from 527 issues of various American journals describing  innovative surgery, the corresponding authors were sent an anonymous  questionnaire which elicited a 35% overall response rate. Fourteen authors  confirmed their work as research and yet only 6 had sought clearance from the  Institution Regulatory Board (IRB). Most authors (15 out of 21) did not submit  their protocol to the IRB . The study highlighted that surgeons appeared to be  largely unaware of regulatory definitions of research involving human subjects.  Thus, the current system of formal definitions, ethical theories and voluntary  professional guidelines to protect patients from unwittingly becoming subjects  of research appears to be inadequate to meet the challenges of surgical innovation <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reitsma AM, Moreno JD.

				<h4>Laparoscopic surgery in  malignancy-ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					Laparoscopy  is now considered an effective tool for diagnosis and staging of malignancies,  especially when combined with laparoscopic ultrasonography. Laparoscopic  evaluation of the abdomen can be performed in as little as 10-15 minutes, and  such evaluation eliminates the need for laparotomy in many patients. However,  the most important ethical issue in these cases is the incidence of port-site  metastases <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bruce J, Ramshaw MD. Laparoscopic surgery for cancer patients . C A Cancer J Clin 1997;47:351-72." id="7">(7)</a>. The smoke created by coagulation during laparoscopic surgery  contains whole cells which is carried as an aerosol during pneumoperitoneum and  could be a mechanism for tumour implantation <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Champault G, Taffinder N, Ziol M, Riskalla H, Catheline JM. Cells are present in the smoke created during laparoscopic surgery. Br J Surg 1997;84:993-95." id="8">(8)</a>. Therefore, intentional  coagulation of malignant tissue should be avoided.
				</p>
				<p>
					Procedures  such as laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal carcinoma require prospective trials  before they are made a 'gold standard' procedure. Similarly, the follow up of  these cases is also very short and though most laparoscopic surgeons claim  exciting prospects in many types of cancers, long-term follow up is required  before claiming a laparoscopic procedure as safe and effective alternative to  an open procedure <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ammori BJ.

				<h4>Conversion from  laparoscopic to open-'Shame' !</h4>
				<p>
					Conversion  to laparotomy in laparoscopic surgery has a connotation of 'failure' especially  when surgeons want to maintain their series for publication or want to compete  with peers. In a study on 60 surgeons who experienced bile duct injury after  laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 36% of surgeons described the incident as  'unfortunate' but an expected part of their career, 15% stated that it was an  unfortunate incident that had changed their practice such as to consider a much  lower threshold to convert to open cholecystectomy and to avoid operating at  night or when fatigued; 18% felt that the injury had not altered their career <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Francoeur JR, Wiseman K, Buczkowski AK, Chung SW, Scudamore CH. Surgeons' anonymous response after bile duct injury during cholecystectomy. Am J Surg 2003;185:468-75." id="10">(10)</a>. The most interesting part of the study was that only 43% of the surgeons  believed that bile duct injuries are always a surgical error! However, these  surgeons urge the profession to abandon the culture of 'shame' associated with  conversion and to consider conversion as sound clinical judgement.
