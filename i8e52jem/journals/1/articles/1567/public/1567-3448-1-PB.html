				<h4>Knowledge gap</h4>
				<p>
					Science and medical  technology have progressed tremendously whilst medical text books are not,  really, keeping up with these advances. Medical students, thus, find it  difficult to keep their knowledge updated. Under such circumstances, students  look up to their teachers (honorary and full-time) in teaching institutes for  filling this deficiency. It is difficult for these students to refer to  journals because of their clinical postings in the ward and the fact that  students are not encouraged to consult anything other than their texts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development of competence in young doctors to deal effectively  with the health problems of individuals and the community at large is of the  highest priority. The term competence refers to knowledge, skills and attitudes  in action. The trainee must demonstrate these together with proficiency and  accuracy. Deficiency in any of these qualities will hamper the effective  functioning of the doctor.

				<h4>Medical college teachers  have no time for students</h4>
				<p>
					The present teaching staff in medical colleges consists of honorary doctors,  full-time teachers and resident doctors. None of them have time for the  undergraduate students. Honorary professors are very busy with their practices  outside the teaching hospital. Students do not feature on their priority list.  Full-time teachers are very busy in non-academic and administrative work.  Students are overlooked by them. The lecturer in any unit is waiting to start  his own practice or preparing for examinations that will help him emigrate and  has little time for students. The resident doctors are busy with their ward  work and their own postgraduate studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the wards, students often waste their time waiting for  professors to turn up for their teaching clinics. The teachers often fail to  appear or get their juniors to conduct the clinic.Whilst they are at fault,  teachers end up scolding students for their lack of sincerity in working in the  wards.
				</p>
				<p>
					In many private medical colleges there is no infrastructure for  teaching. Students lack both teachers and patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, students are diffident about appearing for  examinations where they can be asked questions on practically any aspect of the  medical sciences, including recent advances.
				</p>

				<h4>Unmet needs in medical colleges</h4>
				<p>
					The past two decades have witnessed several initiatives in medical education.  The report of the Panel of General Professional Education of the Physicians in  the US (Muller, 1984) gave a major impetus to the training of doctors. The  World Summit on Medical Education (1993) has made twenty-two recommendations of  which the following is related to the development of skill and competence:  "Teaching and learning strategies and active student-centred methods of  learning which are competency-based, must be promoted. Medical schools must  focus on effective communication skills."

				<h4>Students forced to look  elsewhere</h4>
				<p>
					Is it surprising, then, that students seek instruction elsewhere? As it is,  coaching and private tuition are very common from the kindergarten to the  twelfth standard examination in the present milieu. Most students entering  medical college have had some form of coaching, at times paying sizeable sums  for it. It is not difficult for them to justify coaching in medical subjects  too, so as to better equip themselves with knowledge and to remain up to date  with recent advances and techniques.

				<h4>Teaching techniques used  in private coaching</h4>
				<p>
					Ideally, theory and practice should be taught together in an integrated manner.  This is not feasible because of organisational problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Teachers in private classes commonly follow three steps:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						describe the skill, explain its significance and utility;
					</li>
					<li>
						demonstrate the skill and provide the students examples of how the expert  teacher uses the skill;
					</li>
					<li>
						arrange practice sessions for the students <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nayar U, Adkoli RV: Standardisation of techniques for imparting skills to doctors. Souvenir 20-21 May, 1997 New Delhi: Medical Council of India 1997." id="1">(1)</a>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					They also use the 'seeing and doing' approach both to classroom  and clinical training. Medical students are adult learners. The teacher  concentrates on providing relevant, task-oriented, participatory (two-way),  friendly (providing a positive feed-back), varied (demonstration, case studies,  role-playing) instruction, building on past experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
					The private coaching classes utilise the services of the many  dedicated and good teachers who are not attached to any medical college, of  whose expertise the students would otherwise be deprived. Most of these  teachers are specialists in their subject and provide a detailed understanding  of their field.
				</p>
				<p>
					These teachers use the latest techniques in teaching computers,  video-cassettes, projectors. They also provide complete, computerised notes on  the subject being taught. Learning is thus made interesting and enjoyable.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order for these classes to be rewarding, they need to live up  to the following criteria:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						utilise experienced and dedicated teachers;
					</li>
					<li>
						demonstrate medical ethics and honesty;
					</li>
					<li>
						show a willingness to improve, update knowledge and provide the best from  the latest information to the students.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					Successful professional teachers rest their reputation on two  legs:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						expertise in and mastery over what they teach;.
					</li>
					<li>
						the use of appropriate education technology.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					All efforts should be directed at encouraging and facilitating  learning by students. "The student must be helped to want to learn, to  learn how to learn and to want to learn as long as life lasts. Few realise how  difficult this task is. We have to remember that there is no one, best, method  of learning or teaching." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao A Krishna: Science and technology of medical education transfer of knowledge and learning techniques.
