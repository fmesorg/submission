              <h4>The present pathetic state</h4>
              <p>
                Ad-hocism is rife in  the medical profession in India. We seem to keep abreast of current medical  knowledge from the information received from medical representatives and from  industry-sponsored conferences. There is no programme for continuing medical education  worth its name. Very few doctors take the effort to regularly read textbooks  and indexed medical journals. Obviously, medical representatives do the job of  selling their products by the 'Convince, corrupt and cancel' methodology.

                With  the stiff competition and ever-burgeoning drug companies with their myriad  tongue-twisting drug combinations, the market is flooded with thousands of  formulations, most of them irrational. Also, with more and more specialists and  super-specialists crowding each other out in the cities, general practitioners  too are often bereft of sufficient patients. We have the situation wherein many  doctors and pharmaceutical companies vie for the restricted pool of patients  who can afford to buy drugs and undergo multiple tests (At present 99% of  people in India cannot afford secondary and tertiary level private health care  and flock to public hospitals for major illness. It is predicted that this  situation will prevail in the year 2020, when an already strained public  hospital infra-structure will be woefully inadequate for the hugely expanded  demand).

              <h4>People are living longer</h4>
              <p>
                Modern medicine has  developed more rapidly in the last century than in the previous accumulated  history of mankind. Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have evolved at a  breathtaking pace. Technological advances have, in the last two decades,  allowed us to probe and intervene in remote, previously inaccessible regions of  the human body.
                </p>
              <p>
                Demographic  statistics show that people are living longer in most parts of the world than  they did forty years ago. The quality of life for patients with some crippling  diseases has undergone a sea change with the advent of transplant operations.  Discoveries such as penicillin, insulin and heparin and their more recent equivalents  have made a big difference in man's ability to combat disease.
                </p>
              <p>
                On  the other hand, we find that there are people, such as in the Caucasian  countries and in parts of India, who live long, healthy lives without recourse  to modern medicine. A few years ago, during a visit to the Narmada valley, I  was surprised to find that people were locally self-sufficient in food, eating  what they grew and plucked. They did not feel the need for additional medical  facilities. The populace was healthy and lived fairly long. Before the Sardar  Sarovar project, the land was fertile, the air unpolluted, clean water aplenty  and greenery all around.

              <h4>Causes of longevity</h4>
              <p>
                If we go deeper into the  mechanisms of longevity, we come across some thought-provoking revelations. In  individual cases, the 'miracles' of modern medicine have been life-saving. The  average life-span in the developed countries is now close to eighty years,  while it was only around forty-five years in these very countries early this  century. Analysis reveals that most of this increase in longevity has been due  to

                <li>
                  a more equitable distribution       of wealth and economic progress, leading to alleviation of poverty and       less malnutrition;

                </ul>
              <p>
                All  the other revolutionary medical discoveries put together have made only a minor  contribution towards the increase in longevity.

                A  typical example is that of rheumatic fever. This scourge, which leads to  crippling heart disease in children and adolescents, continues unabated in  India. In most developed countries, this disease, which was rampant till a few  decades ago, has now disappeared. Penicillin was a major landmark in the  secondary prophylaxis against rheumatic heart disease. What really helped in  removing the scourge was the eradication of poverty, leading to better  nutrition, less overcrowding and improved hygiene. This led to less  streptococcal infections and an enhanced immunity in combating. them. The high-tech heart operations and balloon valvotomies are a poor third in fighting the  problem, since they are palliative measures for advanced disease. Some well-meaning but misguided scientists continue to labour to find a vaccine against  rheumatic fever, while the 'vaccine' is well known: eliminate poverty!

              <h4>Need for careful analysis of 'hard' evidence</h4>
              <p>
                If we are to employ any  therapy, it must be based on hard evidence that it works. A lot of medical  practice in bygone years was empirical, and it was not rare for the 'cure' to  be worse than the disease.
                </p>
              <p>
                In  the current era of a profusion of medical literature, communication revolution,  randomised trials and frequent conferences, one would expect that doctors were  much better informed about current data and concepts. But the newer,  aggressive, market-oriented world has also brought along with it the hard-sell approach, wherein economic pressures and considerations are often  paramount in the making of clinical decisions.
                </p>
              <p>
                Speakers  at some of the conferences are in fact selected by the industry rather than by  medical bodies. Thus those who give maximum business, rather than those with  genuine scientific work, are often invited to deliver lectures.
                </p>
              <p>
                Even  being abreast with current medical literature is not a safeguard against  irrational practice. It is not sufficient to read. One must also be able to  differentiate between grain and chaff and filter out dubious material.  Improperly planned studies, falsification of data, variable patient  populations, inappropriate statistical methods and bias due to funding by  industry lead to inconsistent, even contradictory results, about any treatment  modality.
                </p>
              <p>
                An  even more blatant method is to misrepresent data to make an insignificant  change look dramatic. Take for instance two sets of a thousand patients each,  treated for a serious illness with a drug and a placebo to see if the drug  saved lives. In the group given the placebo, six patients died. In the group  given the drug, 3 patients died. By applying analytical statistical techniques,  this difference was not found significant and deemed due to chance. While  promoting the drug, however, it is driven home that it reduced mortality by  50%! Few doctors look at data critically. As one studies published matter with  a discriminating eye, it soon becomes obvious that one can find evidence to  support almost any therapy. One can selectively quote literature to justify  using a particular drug. There are numerous such examples, but let me use the  example of ischemic heart disease. For patients with stable angina pectoris and  after myocardial infarction, aspirin and betablockers along with nitrates when  needed, have been shown to prolong life. These three drugs suffice for a  majority of these patients. When one goes through medical prescriptions for  such patients, it is common to see that they have been advised to take five or  even ten different medications! At best many of these superfluous drugs would  be harmless if taken alone; but few prescribing doctors are conversant with the  drug interactions that take place when so many medications are administered.  During preclinical testing of any drug it is never given as part of such a  'masala' and hence we have no data on what happens with this 'khichdi' .
                </p>
              <p>
                One  of the techniques to bamboozle an audience into using a particular form of  treatment is by the misuse of statistics. Let me illustrate this. One of the  important issues facing physicians today is whether we can prolong the lives of  patients with ischemic heart disease. Various therapeutic modalities like  bypass surgery, angioplasty, cholesterol lowering drugs, free-radical  scavengers are being used with this hope. Till date, most of these attempts  have not succeeded in proving that they prolong life. Where they do, is in  highly selected subgroups of patients. And yet, our 'messiahs' tout such regimens  such that we wonder how humans ever survived without them in the past!
                </p>
              <p>
                These  'messiahs' find it useful to lump together the 'endpoints' of a trial of any of  these modalities. They lump together death and other, much less catastrophic,  events like recurrent angina or enzyme elevation. They then compare, let us  say, a cholesterol lowering drug with a placebo in a large number of patients  and follow them up for a few years. They are not deterred when they find that  even with the placebo, patients live equally long. They are cheered by noting  that, statistically, more patients in the placebo group developed angina during  follow up. So they lump together death with recurrent angina and prove that the  drug was beneficial in reducing the composite end point.
                </p>
              <p>
                The  tragedy is that even in our medical colleges, we are not trained to probe and  analyse. Dissent is discouraged. Intelligent students enter medical college to  be churned out as memorising robots.
                </p>
              <p>
                Is  there any scope for optimism? When we are massproducing unquestioning zombies  in our medical colleges, it may be asking too much for them to be critical in  analysing the 'evidence'.
