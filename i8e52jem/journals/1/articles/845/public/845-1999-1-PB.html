					The Times of India,  Mumbai, recently published the following obituary note:
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Burjor Nusserwanji  Colabawalla, husband of late Mehroo, father of Khorshed and Kershaw,  father-in-law of Ruiynton and Vanessa, grandfather of Fram, Friya and Mitali  passed away peacefully on 23 September 2002 after a long illness borne with  courage and dignity. Cremation: Chandanwadi on the morning of 25 September.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many memories flashed  through my mind as I digested this information. Let me share some of them with  you.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had the privilege of  being Dr Colabawalla's house-surgeon at the St George's Hospital, Bombay for  six months in 1962. The hospital catered to the poor and Dr Colabawalla was the  consultant urologist to them. Dr Colabawalla impressed me with his concern for  every patient under his care and the long hours he spent in the hospital each day.  He was never in a hurry, concentrated entirely on the patients under his care  whilst he was in the hospital and knew exactly what was happening to each of  them at all times.
				</p>
				<p>
					St George's was then  considered merely a service hospital. In it, he conducted several novel  studies. He enrolled Dr Phiroze E Billimoria, the outstanding radiologist in  Bombay at that time, and did arteriographic studies on patients with diseased  kidneys and high blood pressure. You will realise the significance of this work  when you learn that no other hospital in Bombay could then do such studies and  that the tests were done free of cost to the patients, Dr Billimoria absorbing  the damages. The contrast studies in diseases of the epididymis and vas  deferens is another example of their pioneering research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Especially relevant to  this journal is his sterling character and strong sense of ethics. The  following anecdote, narrated by Dr Vijay Dave, another of my teachers, will  give you an inkling of Dr Colabawalla's passionate nature. As Dr Dave entered  Ben Nevis (the building where Dr Colabawalla lived and saw patients), he was  startled by a middle-aged person with flying hair running out and away as  though in fear of his life with Dr Colabawalla in hot pursuit, features  contorted by anger. Realising that the chase was futile, Dr Colabawalla  returned to Ben Nevis. He stopped as he saw Dr Dave. Since an explanation was  obviously in order, he panted: "Sorry about this, Vijay. That bloody  doctor had the nerve! He asked me for a share of my fees for seeing the patient  he brought for consultation!!"
				</p>
				<p>
					Generations of resident  doctors at the Grant Medical College and Sir J J Group of Hospitals (of which  St George's was one) will long recall the help and support he and his  colleagues at Ben Nevis gave them whenever they had to confront the authorities  in government in protest against wrongs done to them. Dr Colabawalla's forte  was the careful study of regulations and the subsequent evolution of battle  strategy against those in power supporting each claim and accusation with  unchallengeable data and references to relevant rules. When told that such  actions would not make him popular with the powers-that-be, he snorted, as he  puffed his pipe, "I'm not out to win a popularity poll, nor do I want  anything from them for myself. Let us fight for what is right." It is to  his credit that he fought many such battles and was undaunted by the occasional  failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					His principal concern  during the last decade or so of his life was the right of the individual Indian  to die with dignity. Mr Minoo Masani, impressed by similar movements abroad,  founded a Society to champion this cause and found a ready, willing and able  ally in Dr Colabawalla. After Mr Masani's demise, Dr Colabawalla headed the  Society and spent much of his time and energy for this cause. The deprivation  of all rights of the terminally ill patient, the indignity of lying helpless  with tubes inserted into or emerging from every imaginable and unimaginable  bodily orifice and blood vessel, impersonal and extremely expensive 'intensive  care' and the disconnection of the dying person from all those near and dear  was anathema to him. It was right of every Indian, he felt, to decide how and  where he wished to die and he did his best to foster law to ensure that every  citizen was given this legal guarantee. He was quick to point out that his was  not an advocacy for mercy-killing or the taking away of a life but also  maintained that it was up to the individual to make the final decisions when in  the grip of a terminal and often very painful illness. Society was duty bound  to honour such a decision.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was an ardent  supporter of this journal and readily obliged whenever called upon to write for  it, comment on a paper or offer advice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Always forthright and  never one to mince words or dance in circles around a topic, Dr Colabawalla was  not without his critics but those who knew the man admired him. For me,  personally, he was teacher, guide, liberal benefactor and role model. It is not  often that one comes across persons cast in the same mould as his. And that is  a pity!
