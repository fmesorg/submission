				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Issues related to abortion constitute an important debate in
					medical ethics. In Iran and other Islamic states, abortion is discussed
					from an Islamic perspective, but the legalisation of abortion varies
					in different Islamic countries. For years, Iran did not legalise induced
					abortion but permitted it under certain conditions. The Iranian
					parliament ratified the Therapeutic Abortion Act on June 21, 2005.
					The new law, which allows abortion under a wider set of guidelines, will promote women's reproductive health

					Abortion is an emotive subject. For decades, it has raised a
					variety of issues, some of them arising out of different religious
					beliefs. The philosophical concept of personhood, the question
					of when life begins, and the rights of the foetus and the mother
					have often been debated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Islam teaches that life is a sacred gift from Allah. According to
					Islamic beliefs, the foetus undergoes a series of transformations;
					it begins as an organism and becomes a full human being when
					it is "
					ensouled"
					at 120 days from the moment of conception <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shaikh S. Family planning, contraception and abortion in Islam: undertaking khilafah: moral agency, justice and compassion. In: Maguire DC, editor. Sacred rights: the case for contraception and abortion in world religions. New York: Oxford University Press; 2003. p 102-128." id="1">(1)</a>.
					The rights of the child begin prior to her/his birth; so making
					decisions about the foetus is not entirely in the hands of
					the parents. Before ensoulment, however, abortion may be
					permitted in special situations, particularly if the mother's life is
					at risk. In effect, the embryo, even in the first days of its existence,
					has the right to live and no one has the right to kill it; but the
					punishment for eradicating a foetus at the pre-ensoulment
					stage will be less than abortion after ensoulment or after the
					end of the fourth month of pregnancy <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Larijani B, Zahedi F. Islamic perspective on human cloning and stem cell research. Transplant Proc 2004; 36(10): 3188-9." id="2">(2)</a>. In conformity with

				<h4>The new abortion law in Iran</h4>
				<p>
					Iran has advanced in recent decades in the field of biomedical
					research. It has made great strides in genetics, transplantation
					and stem cell research. Health statistics demonstrate increased
					life expectancy, decreased infant and maternal mortality and
					lower population growth rates <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Haq CL, Mohammadi A, Smith SR. Medical education reform in Iran.

				<p>
					The Iranian parliament has ratified some laws in recent years
					<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Deceased or Brain Dead Patients Organ Transplantation Act, IR Iran
					Parliament. No. H/24804-T/9929 (4 June 2000)." id="14">(14</a> ,<a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Embryo Donation to Infertile Spouses Act, IR Iran Parliament. No. 33704 (5 August 2003)." id="15">15)</a>, including the Therapeutic Abortion Act on June 21,
					2005 <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Therapeutic Abortion Act, IR Iran Parliament. No. 2/85876 (21 June 2005)." id="16">(16)</a>. This Act was approved after vigorous debate between
					opponents and supporters.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Act permits therapeutic abortion after a definite diagnosis
					by three experts and a confirmation by the Legal Medicine
					Organisation (LMO). This decision may be based on foetal
					diseases leading to afflictions for the mother due to foetus
					malformation or retardation, or based upon life-threatening
					maternal diseases. Abortion may be carried out before
					ensoulment with the woman's consent and any liability or
					punishment would not be directed toward the physician.
					Offenders going contrary to the provisions of the Act will be
					punished according to the penalties of Islamic law.
					The Act was passed at a public session of the parliament on May
					31, 2005, and it approved by the Guardian Council on June 15,
					2005
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the earlier law, abortion before four months was permitted
					if the mother's life was at risk, but her husband's consent
					was mandatory. The new law in Iran permits termination of
					pregnancy during the first four months if the foetus is mentally
					or physically handicapped or if the mother's life is in danger.
					According to the new law, the woman's consent is sufficient to
					carry out the abortion. However, three specialists must confirm
					that the foetus is disabled or the mother has a life-threatening
					condition. A high proportion of the requests for abortion is
					made in the first trimester and the new law will facilitate the
					process when there are genetic disorders or serious maternal
					disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abortion is legally permitted in many countries under some
					conditions, such as the need to save the mother's life or
					safeguard her physical and/or mental health, in cases of rape or
					incest, or of foetal impairment, or for economic or social reasons
					<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Unsafe abortion. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2004. [Cited 2005 Oct 20]. Available at www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/unsafe_abortion_estimates_04/" id="7">(7)</a>. Abortion in Iran is limited to therapeutic indications as
					defined by the law, but even in the case of illegal abortions, postoperative care is available in Iran's public and private hospitals
					as part of primary health care <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roudi-Fahimi F. Iran's family planning program: responding to a nation's needs. MENA Policy Brief. [serial on the Internet]. 2002. Washington: Population Reference Bureau, 2002. [Cited 2006 March 8]. Available from: www.prb.org/pdf/IransFamPlanProg_Eng.pdf" id="17">(17)</a>. Emergency contraception is
					also available in family planning clinics. Health care providers
					do not feel compelled to report illegal abortions to authorities
					and these cases are not prosecuted unless someone records
					a grievance. The use of prostaglandin instead of curettage to
					induce abortion has significantly reduced the maternal mortality rate in Iran, even in cases of illegal abortion <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fallahian M, Mohammad-Zadeh F. Trends in abortion in Iran: 1994-2002. Arch Iranian Med 2005;8(3): 217-218. Available from: http://razi.ams.ac.ir/AIM/0583/ 0013.pdf" id="18">(18)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Iran's ministry of health has prepared the draft of the executive
					bylaw of the Act, but it has not yet been published. The Legal
					Medicine Organisation had defined 51 foetal and maternal
					disorders that could be included, including disorders such
					as hydrops fetalis with any etiology; conditions resulting
					in neonatal death such as anencephaly; diseases such as
					meningoencephalocele; life-threatening maternal conditions
					such as active phase of HIV infection, renal failure, heart failure,
					resistant epilepsy, active uncontrolled lupus, etc; and disorders
					leading to handicap or disability.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the LMO, numerous requests for abortion due to
					disabling foetal disorders was one of the reasons for bringing
					in the new law. A customary preference for consanguinous
					marriage in Iran increases the incidence of congenital disorders
					such as haemoglobinopathies (particularly &szlig;-thalassaemia).
					The age of marriage for educated women has increased in
					recent years and pregnancies after the age of 35 have become
					more frequent, which come with worries about chromosomal
					disorders.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new law transfers the responsibility for the abortion to
					medical specialists and therefore the decision to abort is not
					limited to the proposed 51 disorders. However, the equipment
					to detect all types of foetal disorders is not currently available
					all over Iran. But awareness among Iranian families about family
					planning has increased and they seek facilities in urban medical
					centres. The new law will enable primary health care centres in
					rural areas to screen pregnant women and refer them to betterequipped centres.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					An estimated 68,000 women die as a consequence of unsafe
					abortions each year all over the world <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Unsafe abortion. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2004. [Cited 2005 Oct 20]. Available at www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/unsafe_abortion_estimates_04/" id="7">(7)</a>. Estimates of the World
					Health Organisation for the year 2000 indicate that 19 million
					unsafe abortions take place every year and almost all of them
					occur in developing countries <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Unsafe abortion. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2004. [Cited 2005 Oct 20]. Available at www.who.int/reproductive-health/publications/unsafe_abortion_estimates_04/" id="7">(7)</a>. Experience in some countries
					has shown that if abortion is legalised, related maternal deaths
					drop significantly <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Royston E, Armstrong S. Preventing maternal deaths. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2004." id="19">(19)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abortion remains restricted in many Islamic countries
					and illegal abortion remains a subject of debate. In most
					Islamic states, abortion is viewed according to Islamic points of
					view, but legalisation of abortion varies in different Islamic states
					<a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Asman O. Abortion in Islamic countries–legal and religious aspects. Med Law 2004; 23(1): 73-89." id="20">(20)</a>. It is necessary to have effective programmes to manage
					public health issues with culturally and socially appropriate
					solutions.
