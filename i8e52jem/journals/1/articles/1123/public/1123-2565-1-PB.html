				<h4>Testing  for HIV without consent</h4>
				<p>
					When will they ever  learn? People cannot be tested for HIV without their consent. Yet, we keep  reading reports of forcible testing. On July 7, 2001, a district court judge  had ruled that women arrested for alleged prostitution in Noida, Uttar Pradesh,  could not be forced to undergo HIV tests. Yet, Noida's Sector 20 police station,  which arrested eight women in allegedly similar circumstances on May 15, 2003,  has sought that the accused take HIV tests. A Dasna Jail official confirmed  that a Noida magistrate had directed jail authorities to get HIV tests done for  the accused.

				<h4>Health  care: the most corrupt service sector</h4>
				<p>
					In a year, Rs 26,728  crore is paid in bribes across the service sectors in India. The health sector  was the most corrupt among the 10 studied sectors, the others being education,  police, land administration, judiciary, power, taxation, railways, telecommunications  and public distribution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors were the main culprits, demanding 77% of the bribes, to admit patients  and administer proper care. Every 12th Indian was cited as paying about Rs 621  per year while dealing with the health sector.

				<h4>Take  care of yourself in the hospital</h4>
				<p>
					After a three-day-old  infant was kidnapped from a government hospital in Nagpur, the hospital  superintendent said that none of the hospital staff was involved in the  incident. 'We take a written undertaking from every patient that the hospital  will not be responsible for the security of the newborn,' said Dr C V Chaudhri,  superintendent. The mother had handed over her baby to an unknown woman who had  befriended her, and told her that the infant had to be taken to the dispensary  to administer some medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Chaudhuri explained  that it was not possible to keep track of the hundreds of relatives and  well-wishers who visit the hospital each day. Fortunately, the baby was found  abandoned some days later and was returned to the mother.

				<h4>Kidney  trade back in Mumbai</h4>
				<p>
					The kidney trade is  making a comeback in Maharashtra. Earlier this year, a patient operated upon  for a hernia had a kidney removed as well, without his consent. Recently, the  police have arrested the middlemen involved in selling the kidney of a migrant  from Kerala for Rs 4,00,000. The case came to light because the donor didn't  receive Rs 50,000&mdash;his share&mdash;and complained to the police.
				</p>
				<p>
					A state government committee (which has the Director of Health Services and the  Medical Education Secretary as its members) is meant to scrutinise applications  for transplants, especially donations by non-relatives for 'reasons of  affection', and prevent fraudulent 'donations' which are actually kidney sales.  Dr G B Daver, ex officio member of the evaluation committee, said that the  panel relied heavily on hospitals for the documents and hence chances of  detecting forgeries were poor.

				<h4>The Tamil Nadu  government on organ transplants</h4>
				<p>
					The Tamil Nadu state  Health Department had decided to reconsider the registration granted to 28  Chennai hospitals for kidney transplant following complaints of 'rampant organ  sale' in these hospitals. There have been reports that some hospitals do not  even qualify for the registration. Surprise checks at these hospitals to find  out if they still deserve the transplant status will be carried out by the  authorities.

				<h4>The  kidney business in Punjab: an open secret</h4>
				<p>
					The Rs 100 crore kidney  business in Punjab came to the notice of the press a few months ago. But, as  our reader Satya Pal Dang points out, it was an open secret for years. It  involved doctors like surgeon P K Sareen, Dr O P Mahajan, principal of the Government  Medical College and Dr Jagdish Gargi, members of the Authorisation Committee,  Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Advocate Rajan Puri, police and  politicians (the present chief minister says the trade could not have  flourished without the connivance of the previous Akali Dal-BJP regime).
				</p>
				<p>
					What first started as a blood donation business with labourers receiving Rs 10  and a glass of milk for their 'donations' evolved to an organised kidney supply  business. Workers were promised jobs for Rs 200 a day and taken to the city  where they were put up in guesthouses and a dossier prepared for when a demand  for their type of kidney came along. Once a recipient was found, he was forced  to undergo surgery and discharged with the warning that complaining could  get them arrested for participating in an illegal trade. Indeed, when the scam  first hit the headlines, donors (not the recipients) were arrested!
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Sareen said he was merely a surgeon and had nothing to do with the  Authorisation Committee or the middlemen. Members of the Authorisation  Committee plead that they had no means to verify the documents.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Punjab unit of the Indian Medical Association urged the government to order  a judicial probe into the kidney removal rackets, especially in Ludhiana,  Bathinda, Amritsar and Jalandhar.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospitals all over India referred kidney patients to Amritsar where 1,922  unrelated transplants were performed since 2000, compared to 650 in Delhi  during the same period. No one&mdash;no government monitoring agency, no hospital  authority, no medical body&mdash;saw or reported anything amiss.

				<h4>New  law banning sex selection</h4>
				<p>
					A recent amendment in  the law governing prenatal diagnostic techniques has banned sex selection by in  vitro fertilisation (IVF). The Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and  Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994, has been renamed the Pre-conception and  Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 2003.
				</p>
				<p>
					The new law requires that all ultrasound equipment must be registered and  reports on their use be filed with the appropriate authority.

				<h4>And  in Tamil Nadu as well...</h4>
				<p>
					The Tamil Nadu Medical  Council, the registering authority for medical practitioners in the state,  declared that it would come down heavily against doctors abetting sex selective  abortion. Dr M Balasubramanian, president of the TNMC, stated that the Council  would listen to the complaints of doctors conducting prenatal diagnostic tests  to identify foetal sex followed by sex-selective abortion. He also said that,  if convinced, the Council would constitute a disciplinary committee to enquire  into the complaint and issue warnings, temporarily cancel the registration or  even permanently debar doctors from practice.

				<h4>No  way out for victims of negligence</h4>
				<p>
					A one-year-old child  lost her eye when the doctor mistook cataract for cancer and removed the eye.  No other eye specialist, including the doctor, approached for a second opinion  before her child was operated upon, agreed to help confirm the mistake. The hospital  refused to hand over discharge papers leaving the mother with no evidence to  prove the doctor's negligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Five per cent of the 5,000 consumer complaints reported from 1991 to 1998 were  for medical negligence. Less than 40 judgements were delivered against the  doctors in these cases because of lack of comment from a technical expert.  Doctors who provide expert comments through ACASH [Association of Consumer  Action in Safety and Health] to complainants, refuse to let their identities be  revealed and appear for cross-examination. ACASH is no longer able to get  experts to depose before the court.
				</p>
				<p>
					Complainants could also try to approach the medical council-which has a backlog  of 158 cases, some lodged as far back as 1989.

				<h4>State  medical councils want more power</h4>
				<p>
					The medical councils of  Karnataka, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Kerala, Maharashtra,  Madhya Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar and Punjab demand reforms in the  functioning of the Medical Council of India. They would like the exclusive right  of registration of medical practitioners and greater control over medical  colleges all over India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The state councils want their state governments to amend the relevant Acts and  rules to empower the state medical council to levy punitive fines and award costs  to complainants, award penalty for malicious complaint, and issue injunction  against publicity in mass media for cases under trial for a period not  exceeding 180 days.
				</p>
				<p>
					The councils have also demanded that if a case of medical negligence is filed  with a police station, the medical practitioner should be arrested only after  consulting the state medical council.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctors have said that the councils will ask the Press Council of India to  give strict instructions. 'We don't need press trials and press convictions.  The media should abide by its ethics while reporting about doctors' alleged  involvement in criminal cases,' said Dr Sapatnekar, administrator of the  Maharashtra Medical Council.

				<h4>Finally,  medical ethics in the curriculum</h4>
				<p>
					Aspiring doctors will  soon have to learn about ethics before they graduate from medical school.  The move, initiated by the Nashik-based Maharashtra University of Health Sciences,  is part of a countrywide project kicked off by the World Health Organization  (WHO) and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The WHO and ICMR have  designed a training programme on ethics for medical faculty members. Once the  ethics curriculum is ready, approval will be sought from the Medical Council of  India and the subject introduced in medical colleges across the country. Dr  Dayanand Dongaonkar, Vice Chancellor of the Health Sciences University, said  the university's academic council would decide on how the ethics module should  be integrated into the current curriculum.

				<h4>Take  the sample and run</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Council for  Medical Research (ICMR) is investigating how a team of foreign scientists  obtained blood samples of a tribal population of Andhra Pradesh for a  controversial genetic study without the knowledge or permission of the ICMR.  Blood samples were collected from 180 people belonging to the Chenchu and Koya  tribes in Andhra Pradesh, from 106 Bengalis of different castes, 58 Konkanastha  Brahmins from Mumbai and 53 Gujaratis. The team consisted of scientists from  the UK, US, Russia, Germany, Estonia and Kuwait.

				<h4>Blood  collection scam</h4>
				<p>
					The Surat police busted  an alleged blood donation and serum extraction racket run for the past three  years. Three people including a doctor have been arrested in connection with  the racket run under the aegis of Fairdeal [!] Diagnostics.
				</p>
				<p>
					D J Patel and his son Mehul bought blood from professional donors in violation  of the law and derived blood products to be sold to laboratories for diagnostic  and research purposes. Some products made by Fairdeal include Anti A,  Anti B, Anti AB and VDRL serum. Dr A M Desai provided the professional  donors with fitness certificates.
				</p>
				<p>
					The racket was busted when a patient in a government hospital was found to have  donated 90 times between January 2003 and May 2003.
