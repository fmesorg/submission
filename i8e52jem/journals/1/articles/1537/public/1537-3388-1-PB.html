					An outrageous test was conducted on a student  nurse who was seeking admission to the nursing course at King George Hospital,  Vishakapatnam. In association with this, two gynaecologists, Dr Sasi Prabha and  Dr Varalakshmiwere found guilty of  conducting per vaginal test on the nursing student and have been suspended.  This might not have been a single incident which has occurred. Many such cases  might have gone unnoticed in the past. We do not believe that such tests should  be considered routine tests. To keep up the professional ethics and unity of  the nursing profession, and so that such incidents are never repeated in  future, it was mandatory for us to check with some of the authorities on  nursing on the guidelines for admission to the nursing course. (Their names are  withheld, at their request).

					A senior nurse from Bombay Hospital said per  vaginal examination is not at all necessary for admission into the nursing  course. A pelvic examination might well be necessary to rule out any other  gynaecological or infectious problems and that too only if indicated. She adds  that genital examination, mainly scrotal examination is done for candidates  appearing for defense services and other such cadres. Some of the medical  examinations on admission include routine examinations such as general check-up, chest x-ray and routine examinations of blood. HIV test has also recently  been included. This general check up does not include a per vaginal examination  or virginity test.

					A senior lecturer from the department of  nursing, KEM Hospital states per vaginal examination is not necessary at all.  Most of the schools of nursing admit students who are married. Students with  children and widows are also admitted to the course as per the age-limit. If  this is permissible, then the question of conducting such tests by a doctor  does not arise at all. Even in the past, nurses who were married with children  and widowed were admitted to the course. It also mainly depends on the  institutional policy that a married student does not become pregnant during the  course of study as it interferes with her study. Even if she is pregnant and  has to deliver, she can appear for next term of examination -- the only focus  being the successful completion of the course.
				</p>

					As the terms and conditions imply so, such  attempts to outrage modesty of a person should not be done by any medical  authorities for those who seek admission to nursing courses. Other experienced  nursing persons suggest that such untoward activities by the medical and non-medical authorities associated with the school of nursing should be brought to  the notice of the public and be intimated to the Indian Nursing Council or  State Nursing Council so as to seek suitable solutions. There are also the  professional bodies such as Trained Nurses Association of India or the Nurses  Federation of India who will help in situations such as these. We personally  believe that all concerned nursing leaders should seriously take up this matter  and formulate specific guidelines on the admission criteria. This will lead to  theprofessionalism and to strengthening the ties of nursing so that in future,  nurses do not suffer agony or embarrassment out of such activities.
