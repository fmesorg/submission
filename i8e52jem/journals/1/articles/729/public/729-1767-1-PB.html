					Renu Addlakha (RA) sensitively portrays ethical issues and
					dilemmas inherent in anthropological research, particularly in
					research projects carried out in institutionalised settings among
					marginalised and stigmatised populations <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Addlakha Renu. Ethical quandaries in anthropological fieldwork in psychiatric settings. IJME 2005; 2: 55-56." id="1">(1)</a>. As a conscientious
					researcher, well attuned to the nuances and shades of ethical
					questions and concerns, she was consciously and consistently
					reflective. Thus, she managed to identify and address competing
					and conflicting ethical concerns.
				</p>
				<p>
					While working in a psychiatric setting, an anthropologist has
					at least three sets of 'informants' or 'respondents': health care
					providers, patients and their families. Each of them may have
					differing ideas and definitions of mental health and also different
					expectations regarding the desired outcome of institutional
					care.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Blurring identities</h4>
				<p>
					Building rapport is crucial to anthropological research, and the
					time invested in building relationships yields rich, complex data.
					RA notes that "... personal rapport proved invaluable, since it
					gave me unlimited access to the time, resources and personnel
					of the hospital". The process of building rapport often leads to
					a blurring of the researcher's identity &ndash; for hospital personnel
					as well as for patients and family members. Though the
					anthropologist may initially be viewed as a researcher, in time
					health personnel may regard her /him as a colleague, friend and
					confidant. Similarly, patients and their family members will view
					the researcher as an understanding and sympathetic 'health
					personnel', who has more access to the health resources than
					they do.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anthropological methods such as participant observation and
					informal interviews are often not seen as research tools in the
					same way as a questionnaire or survey instrument is. Moreover,
					anthropological research is long term, and familiarity leads to
					development of intimacy and shedding of inhibitions. This
					opens up hidden areas to the researcher who is then is viewed
					not as an 'outsider' but as a 'quasi-insider' privy to much more
					sensitive information than an outsider would ever have. Even
					those 'respondents' who want to control the anthropologist's
					access to information and the observations made may find it
					hard to do so. Patients and family members drop their guard
					and discuss sensitive family matters and reveal their feelings
					and emotions.
				</p>

				<h4>Informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					In such situations, formal processes of obtaining informed consent, developed in the context of structured research in
					medical settings where the identities and roles of the researcher
					are more clearly defined, may not be suitable. The emphasis on
					standardised written procedures for obtaining informed consent
					and the requirement of a formal signature have proved to be
					deterrents to 'full' participation by certain types of respondents.
					This may not be a barrier in medical institutional settings where
					signatures are obtained as a matter of course. Unfortunately
					the spirit behind informed consent is often forgotten, and it
					becomes a routine, standardised procedure. As RA points out, in
					anthropological research of a long duration, it is imperative to
					renew, renegotiate and reaffirm informed consent. This would be
					especially important if the patients' health status is in flux, if they
					have mood swings, and so on. Even when there is conscientious
					and systematic explanation of the nature of research, people
					with medical problems and their family members will find it
					difficult to comprehend that no direct benefit may accrue to
					them <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Molyneux C S, Peshu N and Marsh K. Understanding of informed consent in a low-income setting: three case studies from the Kenyan coast. Social Science & Medicine 2004; 59: 2547-2559." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					RA made a proactive decision to privilege the patient over family
					members, and did not include patients who were reluctant to
					participate even if their family members were keen. In some
					ways this was an easier situation to tackle, though the patient
					could have suffered adverse consequences. It would have been
					worse if the opposite had happened: if the patient wanted to
					participate while the family members refused, fearing stigma.
					Recruiting participants when their families disapprove could
					adversely affect the relationship between patients and care
					givers.
				</p>
				<p>
					RA raises the issue of shared confidentiality between the
					researcher and patients and family members on the one hand,
					and between researcher and health personnel on the other. It is
					a challenge to maintain this shared confidentiality over a period
					of time in an institution with well-defined hierarchies. It would
					have been useful to examine this further with illustrations of
					situations where confidentiality was threatened and efforts
					made to maintain confidentiality, and where confidentiality
					had to be compromised in the interests of the patients or the
					institution.
