<h3>Should mental health assessments be integral to domestic violence research?</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Veena A Satyanarayana, Prabha S Chandra</h4>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Research on sensitive issues such as abuse and violence in
					vulnerable populations poses several ethical dilemmas. An
					important aspect is the impact of such enquiries on one's mental
					health. This paper discusses specific ethical issues related to
					mental health based on violence research conducted and
					reviewed by the authors. Research on violence among women
					includes the possibility that some revelations are occurring for the
					first time and are likely to be emotionally charged. Further, the very
					act of disclosure may involve emotional risks for the respondent.
					Psychological distress may be present prior to, during, or following
					the study. Hence assessing mental health parameters becomes essential and integral to research of this nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several issues in methodology are also important in mitigating
					the level of distress. Research on sensitive issues should either use
					measures developed in the same culture or those with adequate
					adaptation. The order of questions, language and method of
					termination of the interview may often make a difference to its
					psychological impact. While focus group discussions and semi
					structured interview schedules are most suited, questionnaires with
					a less structured and rigid approach may also be used. Preludes
					may be introduced to facilitate transition between different
					sections of an interview schedule and to provide a rationale for
					further enquiry. Obtaining informed consent in violence research
					should be a process rather than a one-time formality. Reports
					of adverse events are likely in violence research and hence such
					studies must include mental health intervention, ongoing follow
					up, documentation and appropriate referral services. Finally, since
					the researcher and the subject of the research are both affected
					in a study of this nature, adequate sensitisation, on going training and supervision of research staff are essential.Based on findings
					from ongoing research on violence and from review of other
					studies done in India, the paper will focus on best practices in
					addressing mental health issues in domestic violence research.

				<h4>Research on sensitive issues with specific reference to
				domestic violence</h4>
				<p>
					Research in domestic violence (DV) is gaining more attention
					in recent years. Having evolved into a growing public health
					problem, DV also poses a considerable threat to and violation
					of human rights. WHO <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO/WHD World report on violence. Geneva (Switzerland): World Health Organisation;1997." id="1">(1)</a> defines DV as, "a range of sexually,
					psychologically and physically coercive acts used against
					adult and adolescent women by a current or former male
					intimate partner." Women are vulnerable to many forms of violence, DV being the most common form <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Heise L, Pitanguy J, Germain A. Violence against women: The hidden health burden. Discussion Paper 255. Washington, DC: World Bank;1994." id="2">(2)</a>. In the context
					of DV, the victim is almost always the woman or the wife and
					the perpetrator is the man, very often the husband or intimate
					partner <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bacchus L, Mezey G, Bewley S, Haworth A. Prevalence of domestic violence when midwives routinely enquire in pregnancy. BJOG 2004 May 111(5): 441-5." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leung WC, Leung TW, Lam YY, Ho PC. The prevalence of domestic violence against pregnant women in a Chinese community. Int J Gynaecol Obstet 1999 Jul; 66 (1): 23-30." id="4">4)</a>. The terms DV and intimate partner violence (IPV)
					are used interchangeably in the literature and this paper.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although DV is a global phenomenon and cuts through
					socio-cultural barriers, the bulk of the literature comes from
					developed countries. The reasons for the paucity of research
					in developing countries are: concealing or under reporting
					of facts, a reluctance to disclose facts, fear of jeopardising
					family respect, and poor orientation to research. Research on
					sensitive issues involving vulnerable subjects poses several
					methodological and ethical challenges to the researcher.
					Participants in a study of DV are doubly vulnerable, being
					female in a patriarchal society and being a victim of violence.
					Therefore, any attempt to study sensitive issues such as abuse/
					violence among vulnerable subjects such as women ought to
					be ethically informed.

				<h4>Impact of DV on mental health and the need for
				mental health assessment</h4>
				<p>
					Violence in any form impacts one's mental health. Women
					exposed to both hysical/psychological violence and
					psychological violence alone had a higher incidence and
					severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms, post traumatic
					stress disorder (PTSD), and thoughts of suicide, than women
					in the control group <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pico-Alfonso MA, Garcia-Linares MI, Celda-Navarro N, Blasco-Ros C, Echebur&uacute;a E, Martinez M.

J Womens Health (Larchmt) 2006 Jun; 15(5):599-611." id="5">(5)</a>. Participants reporting DV had higher
					scores on depression, anxiety, somatisation, low self esteem
					and were likely to have attempted suicide. Spouses of these
					participants were found to abuse drugs and alcohol <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="McCauley J, Kern DE, Kolodner K, Dill L, Schroeder AF, DeChant HK, Ryden J, Bass EB, Derogatis LR.

Problem drinking and intimate partner violence. J Stud Alcohol 2002; 63(2): 205-14." id="8">8)</a>. Severe forms of
					DV were significantly associated with mental health symptoms
					and health behaviours, including anxiety, depression, difficulty
					concentrating, memory loss, suicide attempts, weight
					gain, past history of smoking and illicit drug use <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sato- DiLorenzo A, Sharps PW.

					depression, anxiety, PTSD and dissociation are common
					psychiatric syndromes associated with violence, in some cases,
					psychological or emotional disturbances may not amount to a
					syndrome; instead, sub-threshold symptoms may be apparent.
					Further, mental health disturbances can either be the cause or
					the effect of violence <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chandra PS, Carey MP, Carey KB, Shalinianant A, Thomas T.

Correlates of intimate partner violence among female patients at a North Carolina emergency department. N C Med J 2007 Mar-Apr; 68 (2):89-94." id="11">(11)</a> found that one-third of all female patients reported at least one form of IPV in their lifetimes. IPV was associated
					with a low self-rating of physical and mental health, frequent
					visits to the emergency room and problems with alcohol, drugs,
					and mental health. The findings emphasise the importance
					of screening all women for IPV using protocols that address
					mental health and substance abuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abused women in various settings had increased health
					problems such as injury, chronic pain, gastrointestinal and
					gynecological signs including sexually transmitted diseases,
					depression and post traumatic stress disorder <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Campbell JC. Health consequences of intimate partner violence. Lancet 2002; 359: 1331-6." id="12">(12)</a>. A recent
					study from India reported mental health correlates of domestic
					spousal violence based on a household survey method in both
					urban and rural areas of seven cities <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumar S, Jeyaseelan L, Suresh S, Ahuja RC. Domestic violence and its mental health correlates in Indian women. Br J Psychiatry 2005; 187: 62-7." id="13">(13)</a>. About 40% of the
					sample reported experiencing violence in their marriage. They
					in turn were at increased risk for poor mental health .
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					Women who experienced partner violence, especially, in the
					West, Hispanic women, were at increased risk of not receiving
					needed mental health care. These findings, therefore, highlight
					the need for culturally sensitive and specific outreach services
					<br />
					that are aware of the effects of partner violence on women's
					mental health, and are informed on how to access these
					services <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lipsky S, Caetano R. Impact of intimate partner violence on unmet need for mental health care: results from the NSDUH. Psychiatr Serv 2007 Jun; 58 (6):822-9." id="14">(14)</a>. In the West it is recommended that health service
					personnel routinely question women about abuse by their
					intimate partner. This is suggested because of the serious health
					consequences of DV and the low identification rate of abuse
					by health services <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Spangaro JM. The NSW Health routine screening for domestic violence program. NSW Public Health Bull 2007 May-Jun; 18(5-6):86-9." id="15">(15)</a>. Psychological distress may be present
					prior to, during, or following the study. Hence assessing mental
					<br />
					health parameters becomes essential and integral to research
					of this nature. Since violence has a strong psychological sequel,
					it becomes ethically imperative to integrate mental health
					assessments in a study of DV.
				</p>

				<h4>Methodological issues</h4>
				<p>
					Research in the area of abuse involves two components that
					are unique. First, it includes a possibility that some revelations
					are occurring for the first time and hence are likely to be
					emotionally charged. Second, research of this nature, by its very
					act of disclosure, may involve risk to the respondent. Therefore,
					the method of inquiry employed in research of this nature
					ought to be sensitive <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Veena AS, Chandra PS. A review of the ethics in research on child abuse. Indian J Med Ethics 2007 Jul-Sep; 4 (3): 113-5." id="16">(16)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Studies on DV both in the West and in India have used household
					surveys, structured interviews and self report measures. Since
					psychological distress may be present prior to, during or
					following the research, several issues in methodology are also
					important in mitigating the level of distress. The methodological
					and ethical issues addressed below are interrelated and
					therefore there may be some overlap. This is primarily because
					in studying sensitive issues, ethical concerns very often inform or
					influence the choice of the method. Instances of ethically driven
					methodology include the following:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Research on sensitive issues should make use of culturally
							relevant definitions of the constructs being studied, e.g.,
							emotional abuse.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Tools that are used to assess abuse should either be developed in the same culture or be adapted to suit the
							requirements of a particular culture.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The order of questions should gradually progress from
							neutral to more sensitive and personal domains and the
							researcher ought to periodically check the participants'
							comfort level.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Language and choice of words used to assess abuse
							ought to be sensitive and not be derogatory, callous and
							judgmental.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The conduct of the interview, manner of probing and
							termination of the interview often make a difference to
							the psychological impact. Preludes may be introduced
							to facilitate transition between different sections of an
							interview schedule and to provide a rationale for further
							enquiry.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Qualitative methods such as focus group discussions
							and semi-structured interview schedules are most suited,
							although questionnaires with a less structured and rigid
							approach may also be used. This method not only yields
							rich data, it also offers the researcher adequate flexibility to
							evaluate and address concerns.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Reports of adverse events are likely in violence research
							hence such studies cannot be bereft of mental health
							intervention, ongoing follow up, documentation and
							appropriate referral services <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh S. Ethics in research: a box of tissues. Psychiatr Bull 2007 May; 31 (3): 81-2." id="17">(17)</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since the researcher and the subject are both affected
							in a study of this nature, adequate sensitisation, ongoing
							training, supervision and debriefing of research staff is
							equally essential <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fontes LA. Ethics in family violence research: cross-cultural issues. Fam Relat 1998 Jan; 47 (1): 53-61." id="18">(18</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meth P, Malaza K. Violent research: The ethics and emotions of doing research with women in South Africa. Ethics, Place and Environment 2003 June; 6 (2):143-59." id="19">19)</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Finally, some women may also report positive mental health
							consequences. Participants often report a sense of relief
							at discussing abuse in the presence of empathic and nonjudgmental researchers, which should also be documented.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					The Council for International Organisation of Medical Sciences
					outlined basic ethical principles for human participants
					enrolled in epidemiological research. These are: respect for
					individuals, non-malfeasance (minimising harm), beneficence
					(maximising benefits) and justice <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ellsberg M, Heise L. Bearing witness: ethics in domestic violence research. Lancet 2002; 359 (9317):1599-604." id="20">(20)</a>.
				</p>
				<p> WHO <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Putting women's safety first: ethical and safety recommendations for research on domestic violence against women. Global Programme on Evidence for Health Policy. Geneva: WHO: 1999." id="21">(21)</a> subsequently published specific ethical guidelines
				for DV research based on the experiences of the International
				Research Network on Violence Against Women.These are: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The safety of respondents and the research team is
						paramount and should infuse all project decisions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Protecting confidentiality is essential to ensure both
						women's safety and data quality.
					</li>
					<li>
						All research team members should be carefully selected
						and receive specialised training and ongoing support.
					</li>
					<li>
						The study design must include a number of actions aimed
						at reducing any possible distress caused to the participants
						by the research.
					</li>
					<li>
						Prevalence studies need to be methodologically sound and should build on current research experience about how to
						minimise the under reporting of abuse.
					</li>
					<li>
						Field workers should be trained to refer women requesting
						assistance to available sources of support. Where few
						resources exist, it may be necessary for the study to create
						short-term support mechanisms.
					</li>
					<li>
						Researchers and donors have an ethical obligation to help
						ensure that their findings are properly interpreted and used
						to advance policy and intervention development.
					</li>
					<li>
						Violence questions should be incorporated into surveys
						designed for other purposes only when ethical and
						methodological requirements can be met.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Obtaining informed consent in violence research should be a
					process rather than a one-time formality. This is because the
					respondent is often unclear about the questions till they are
					<br />
					actually asked. One of the recommendations is to take informed
					consent at every level of sensitive information gathering, that
					is, while moving from questions related to emotional abuse to
					the section on physical abuse and so on. The informed consent
					form should clearly state the risks and benefits involved in
					volunteering for a study of this nature. Refusal rates also need
					<br />
					to be documented, not just for methodological reasons and
					interpretation, but also to indicate reticence on the part of the
					respondent or guardian to participate in such research <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Veena AS, Chandra PS. A review of the ethics in research on child abuse. Indian J Med Ethics 2007 Jul-Sep; 4 (3): 113-5." id="16">(16)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The physical safety of respondents and interviewer from
					potential retaliatory violence by the abuser is of prime
					importance. At the same time women who are both the
					subjects and beneficiaries of research need to give full
					informed consent and ensure that the interview process is
					affirming and does not cause distress <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Elcioglu O, Oncel O, Unluoglu I. Ethics in domestic violence research. Eubios J Asian Int Bioethics 2004 Jan; 14: 50-2." id="22">(22)</a>. The World Medical
					Association Declaration of Helsinki says, "Health and wellbeing of patients must have priority over any scientific result
					or benefit", thus clearly emphasising ethical responsibilities of researchers towards the participants of their study.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Guidelines for integrating mental health assessments
				in DVresearch</h4>			<ol>
					<li>
						Since symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD are most
						prevalent in victims of DV, scales such as Beck Depression
						Inventory, Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale, Beck Anxiety
						Inventory, Hamilton's Anxiety Rating Scale and PTSD Checklist
						may be used.
					</li>
					<li>
						If detailed assessment using the above scales is not possible,
						a brief screening tool such as the GHQ-12 may be administered.
						Participants who are positive on this can be interviewed in
						detail to determine the severity of distress and to rule out false
						positives.
					</li>
					<li>
						Studies using qualitative methodologies can integrate open
						ended questions on some common symptoms of depression,
						anxiety, and PTSD in the interview.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mental health assessments may be incorporated after all
						other assessments, to ensure that participants responses are
						not influenced by their mood state. However, it is important to
						terminate the interview on a positive note.
					</li>
					<li>
						If researchers are not trained in the area of mental health,
						they may have to take inputs from a mental health professional.
					</li>
					<li>
						It also helps to ask the client directly if she has ever felt the
						need for professional psychological help.
					</li>
					<li>
						Services of a mental health professional may be used
						to obtain inputs regarding assessment of mental health,
						training the research staff in the assessment of mental health
						and identifying victims who may require professional help,
						supervision and debriefing for the research staff, and to treat/
						refer distressed participants.
					</li>
					<li>
						Participants who are significantly distressed need to be
						referred to mental health professionals. Those who cannot or
						do not wish to avail of the above, and participants with subclinical distress, ought to be seen by the research staff on a
						follow up basis.
					</li>
					<li>
						Follow up contact can be made at weekly or fortnightly
						intervals to assess for any negative outcomes which may not
						be obvious immediately and to also check for any worsening
						of violence.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is important to have a liaison with the community
						and other organisations working with violence around that
						geographical area, so that they can provide ongoing support.
					</li>
					<li>
						All participants can be given a pamphlet with official contact
						information of the research staff and available psychological
						services, which they can access if and when necessary.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Domestic violence affects different domains of a person's
					life, and its impact on mental health is the most significant.
					Therefore, from an ethical standpoint, mental health
					assessments ought to be integral to research of this nature.
