				<h4>A morale-booster from  an eminent ethicist</h4>
				<p>
					I just noticed that you have an email address. So I take this opportunity to  express my sincere thanks to you and the Editorial Board for sending me the  journal of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is certainly getting better and better. You  are all doing a wonderful job, and I feel it was high time that such a large  country as India have its own journal on the moral dilemmas of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Congratulations! Keep up the good work. If by  any chance my standard of living elevates to the level of a simple bank clerk  then you may expect a financial contribution to the journal even from me!

				<h4>Hospital ethics  committee</h4>
				<p>
					We have learnt of an hospital ethics committee that has been set up in our  institute. I place my thoughts on this subject in the hope of stimulating  discussion on the subject.
				</p>
				<p>
					An ethics committee is easy to constitute but  its functioning can appear very nebulous, especially in a multi-religious and  multi-cultural institution such as ours. It is so much easier for such a  committee to function in institutes run by religious organisations which already  have clear-cut ethical principles which govern the thoughts and shape their  actions. It is also relatively easy for it to function in the West where the  Judaeo-Christian ethic has homogenised societal attitudes and behaviour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our own ethical norms in this country are  confused. We have codified, or tried to codify, principles of ethical behaviour  based, I believe, on Judaeo-Christian thought that was imbibed by Indians  educated by Western minds and exposed to Western literature. I believe the time  has come for our Medical Councils to face this issue head on and formulate  ethical norms that will encourage practice in keeping with our traditional and  modern Indian values.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, there are underlying humane values  that run like a common thread through all religious and cultural traditions,  which should form the backbone of our code of ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					In spite of what I believe, I know that  Medical Councils will not fulfil their legitimate role. It will be up to small  groups (such as the ethics committee at Tata Memorial?) to show the way. This,  I hope, will be a positive fallout of the exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also hope that the ethics committee will not  be an exercise in cosmesis. (I am not so bothered by the witch-hunting  problem. Far worse is to sweep evidence of malpractice under the ethics  committee carpet.)
				</p>
				<p>
					To this end I would suggest that the Committee  be renamed the Ethics and Standards Committee. Members of all departments,  including the staff from the nursing, administration, social service and other  departments,constitute an extended group that could meet every alternate month  to review existing non-technical patient care practices and suggest  improvements that would contribute to overall healthy functioning of the  institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem may be a small one (eg. dealing  humanely with death in the hospital environment, including the nitty-gritty of  handing over the body, reduction of bureaucratic procedures at this sensitive  time etc.) or a major issue such as the lack of access that the general (non- paying) patients have to consultant level care on a day-to-day basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel that until there is a full-fledged  quality management exercise instituted at the Tata Memorial Hospital which  would include a formal medical audit, the Ethics and Standards Committee could fill  this gap in keeping with their avowed objective of improving patient care in  its technical aspects.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think an ethics committee is a step in the  right direction, but it will remain only a step if all it does is review  projects and lay down codes of behaviour in a esoteric manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					To be effective, ethics should not just be  preached but practised. We live in a world where the motto seems to be, 'Do  what I say - don't do what I do.)

				<h4>Objectivity in journals  on medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Exhibiting your personal opinion without fear or favour is one of the most  important principles in the review of medical ethics
				</p>
				<p>
					While reading several editions of <em>Issues in  Medical Ethics</em>, I noticed that most  articles are clearly written from a personal view. Most contributors do not  seek shelter in objectivity or refer to authorities on the matter, which is  common in the 'scientific' journals.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems to me that the main objective of a  journal on medical ethics is to extend your own opinion by reading others,  rather than to obtain objectivity. Of course one has to obtain objectivity  concerning the factual situation, but, as a matter of fact, moral objectivity  is not always realisable. Thus, argumentation may be your only tool to reach  agreement and, as I noticed in <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>, this tool can be very thought-provoking.

				<h4>Corruption in medical  care - is the market the cause?</h4>
				<p>
					One of the most striking features of medical care in India is the extreme  inequality between what it offered to the rich and to the poor. The majority of  patients living in villages do not have access to the most basic necessities  such as immunisation. The metros are flush with the latest technological  marvels several times over, the several magnetic resonance scanners being one  example. It is, however, a mistake to think that this metropolitan plenitude  necessarily translates into better medical care. Those with money to burn are  often subjected to unnecessary and inappropriate investigations. Often, the  results of such tests only complicate matters, cause unnecessary anxiety and  convert hitherto healthy captains of industry into quivering bundles of neurosis.  When such tests are followed by unjustified surgery, the horror is compounded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pressures of the market worsen the situation.  Let me provide an example. In the town where I live, a few doctors acquired a  computerised tomography scanner (CT). It was not long before the need to pay  instalments began to worry them. The group cajoled colleagues in practice to  refer patients for scanning by 'extending the indications for a scan'. The  ubiquitous practice of offering a financial incentive for such reference - disguised  as 'interpretation fee' - was already in vogue'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of unwarranted surgery abound.  Recently I saw a patient with tuberculosis of the lumbar spine without  neurological abnormality who had been subjected to an operation to fuse the  diseased vertebrae. It is standard practice to treat such patients with anti- tuberculous drugs alone as there is seldom any instability. Two months after  the operation, the plates and screws came off the bones they were supposed to  fuse. She had to undergo another operation to remove the metallic implants.  Examples such as these are numerous and each doctor sees only the tip of the  iceberg.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>lssues in Medical  Ethics</em>has discussed this  problem over the past three years. What is the solution ? I am not convinced  that appealing to the better instincts of the medical personnel is likely to  improve matters. The very organisations set up to ensure ethical practice - the  Medical Council of India and the state medical councils - are themselves mired  in corruption.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe the only answer is removal of the  cause, namely the possibility of fleecing patients of huge sums. In other  words, we must abolish the market in medicine. This is possible through a  system that ensures universal medical coverage to all our citizens and registration,  perhaps by the state, of incomes of doctors and other personnel in the health  field. A socialised system will not easily lend itself to corruption.

				<h4>Doctor pressurised</h4>
				<p>
					On July 12, 1996, a police party headed by ASI Sikandar Singh of Police Post  (PP) Jagdev Kalan visited the house of an old handicapped man Ajit Singh whose  wife is totally confined to bed, in village Kotla Gujjran, Jhander. The old man  was beaten up and taken away. He was brought back in a seriously injured condition  and left. People took him to the PP in the village. The police recorded a  report under Section 323 IPC which is for a non-cognisable offence. People  were advised orally to take him immediately to hospital. He was taken to the  Guru Nanak Dev Hospital where injuries were recorded. Afraid that he might die,  the culprits and their friends helped in efforts to save him by giving funds  and by arranging for blood. Ajit Singh, however, died.
				</p>
				<p>
					The police bosses of Majitha police district  tried to pressurise the family and relations of the deceased to compromise.  When this did not succeed, the SSP himself took the position that it was a case  only under the Section 323 of IPC and there was nothing to be done by the  police. When the leader of the Communist Party India (CPI), Satya Pal Dang ,took up the cast, the SSP gave an explanation  that Ajit Singh's death was due to old age. To support this, he said that the  doctor who did the post-mortem has given such an opinion. Apparently the  doctor concerned gave such totally wrong opinion under the police pressure. The  SSP however agreed to order a fresh inquiry.
				</p>
				<p>
					ASI Sikander Singh and his party had no  jurisdiction in PS Jhander. It visited Kotla Gujjaran because some altercation  had taken place. between a son of Ajit Singh and a relative of the ASI. In  this, the latter had received some injury. In this matter a case had already  been registered and the son of Ajit Singh arrested. The ASI, however, chose to  take the law in his own hand and took the revenge in the manner described  above.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the SSP has recommended a magisterial in  enquiry, the activists of the CPI and some concerned people from the village  have requested the DIG, Police, Border Range and the District Magistrate to  order registration of case under Section 304 IPC. However, the law has yet not  taken its course
				</p>
				<p>
					The above account is based on the inquiries  done by the activists of the CPI and some villagers and is also made public in  my statement dated September 9, 1996.

				<h4>Flaunting our 'honours'</h4>
				<p>
					We, medicos, are known to be vain peacocks strutting around, spreading our  qualifications and professional feathers. There was a time when a cardiologist  in Mumbai sported degrees and honours totalling a record 65 alphabetical  characters, topped by the then popular 'SEM'. In desperation, Bombay Telephones  ruled that henceforth it would refrain from printing degrees and  qualifications!
				</p>
				<p>
					We often wonder to whose good such display is  directed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternative medicine is a movement geared  towards weaning patients away from the glamour and glitter of allopathy. Alas!  There too, overkill is achieved by prefixing and suffixing names of leading  lights in a manner that, unhelpably, betrays vanity.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an example in point, we quote from <em>Holistic  Mediscan</em>, July 1996. Therein,  a dignitary is introduced as "Lord Pandit Professor Dr. Sir Anton Jayasuriya,  Chancellor OICUM". It may be that this has some rationale in our age, governed  as it is by imports from Madison Avenue - not only should drugs sell, but so  should doctors!

				<h4>Irrational X-ray  tests</h4>
				<p>
					Most companies, while recruiting employees, conduct x-ray tests as a regular  protocol of health assessment of applicants. This is performed regardless of an  identical recent x-ray examination of an individual and without checking  previous records. A person changing jobs is thus exposed to frequent ionising  radiation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The personnel department also refuses to pass  on the data on his health to the individual. Since earlier x-ray films are not  available to the next agencyrepeat exposure to x-rays becomes inevitable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient is told that the x-ray test  involves 'a small risk'. Should this justify repeated, routine x-irration of  that person? Shouldn't clinical examination be a guideline to prescribing the  test?
				</p>
				<p>
					Is the medical profession over-using this  helpful but hazardous test? This is a question of great relevance to young  persons who constantly seek better prospects.
