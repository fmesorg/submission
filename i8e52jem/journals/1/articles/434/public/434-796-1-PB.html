			<h3>Doctor, is your writing legible?</h3>

				<p>
					Today, computers are used in every field of work including
					medicine. Despite the computer revolution, however, a great
					deal of information in clinical records in hospitals continues to
					be handwritten. The doctor may understand what he/she has
					written, but difficulties arise when other parties are involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					The handwriting of healthcare professionals in general and
					doctors in particular has been known to be illegible and
					difficult to decipher <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leo P. Tracing the roots of illegible handwriting. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2006 Apr 13 [cited 2008 Feb 10]. Available from: http://www.postgazette.com/pg/06103/681741-294.stm#" id="1">(1)</a>. In India, as in most other parts of the
					world, it is generally accepted that doctors have handwriting
					which needs some skill to decipher. Yet the importance of a
					doctor's handwriting cannot be overemphasised. Pharmacists
					and nurses have to read the physician's prescription to dispense
					and administer the correct medication to patients. Patients
					need to understand the prescription to take proper and timely
					treatment. In one study, 117 case notes were examined and
					18 (15%) were so illegible that the meaning was unclear <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Leo P. Tracing the roots of illegible handwriting. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2006 Apr 13 [cited 2008 Feb 10]. Available from: http://www.postgazette.com/pg/06103/681741-294.stm#" id="1">(1)</a>.
					Another study suggests that doctors, even when asked to be as
					neat as possible, produce handwriting that is worse than that
					of other professionals <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lyons R, Payne C, McCabe M, Fielder C. Legibility of doctors' handwriting:quantitative comparative study. BMJ 1998; 317: 863-4." id="2">(2)</a>. This provides supportive evidence
					for the commonly held belief that the legibility of doctors'
					handwriting is unusually poor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The implications of poor penmanship in doctors can be grave:
					it can harm patients, lead to poor performance of nurses and
					support staff, to administration of incorrect drugs and even
					doses, to improper treatment schedules, and even trouble with
					the law <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao BC. My thoughts - Doctors' handwriting. Sunday, 2007 Oct 21.[cited 2008 Feb 10]. Available from: http://badakerecrao.blogspot.com/2007/10/doctors-handwriting.html" id="3">(3)</a>. Medication errors are thought to cause at least 7,000
					deaths a year in the United States, a quarter of which stem from
					mix-ups in drug names <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hughes C. Thou shalt write legibly. BMJ 2003;327: s67-8." id="4">(4)</a>. This is especially important in case of
					drugs with similar names-such as, for example, Terbinafine and
					Terfenadine or Diovol and Daonil-with disastrous consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors have been sued for harm caused due to negligence
					and illegible handwriting. In 1999, a ground-breaking lawsuit
					drew international attention to the implications of doctors'
					handwriting when a cardiologist was fined $225,000 by a Texas
					jury. A prescription he had scrawled for Isordil, a drug for heart
					pain, was misread by the pharmacist as Plendil, used for high
					blood pressure. The patient took the wrong medication and
					died of a heart attack <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rodr&#237;guez-Vera FJ, Mar&#237;n Y, S&#225;nchez A, Borrachero C, Pujol E. Illegible  handwriting in medical records. J R Soc Med 2002; 95: 545-6." id="5">(5</a>,<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waters R. Precarious prescriptions: Can your doctor's handwriting kill you? WebMD 2000. [cited 2008 Feb 12]. Available from: http://www.webmd.com/content/pages/9/1691_50655.htm" id="6">6)</a>.

					This famous or, rather, infamous case was the first time that a
					doctor was convicted solely because of bad handwriting. Six
					American states have subsequently passed legislation making
					doctors' illegible handwriting a fineable offence. The US Food and Drug Administration recognises that bad handwriting
					leads to medication errors and now demands that drug names
					are tested by simulating the process of dispensing drugs using
					handwritten prescriptions <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hughes C. Thou shalt write legibly. BMJ 2003;327: s67-8." id="4">(4)</a>. Even in India the court had
					directed that doctors should write legibly <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bansal RK. Court directs doctors in India to write legibly. Med Leg J 2005;73: 111." id="7">(7)</a>.

					What could be the possible reasons and plausible explanation
					for illegible writing? Is it indifference? Or does it have to do
					with less time, a busy practice, or too many patients, and/or too
					many hospitals to attend to? Is it because the doctor does not
					know the correct spelling and by scribbling he tries to mask
					his ignorance, leaving it to the pharmacist/chemist to decipher
					and decide? Maybe he has not paid enough attention to his
					handwriting during his formative years, or else he is just trying
					to show off (especially so among young graduates) or he takes
					illegible handwriting to be the trademark of a busy medical
					professional, and thinks he is just following in the footsteps of
					earlier generations.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have looked at the consequences and probable causes of
					bad penmanship among doctors, but what remedial measures
					and solutions are there?
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin with, parents and teachers in school should pay more
					attention to ensuring that their wards learn to write legibly.
					Undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses should take
					bad handwriting seriously and penalise careless handwriting
					by cutting exam marks, issuing memos etc. Doctors don't need
					pretty handwriting, just legible handwriting. More needs to
					be done to generate awareness and sensitise doctors to the
					dangerous consequences of unreadable handwriting. Legible
					handwriting should be considered part of the duty of a medical
					practitioner and failure to conform should be penalised.
					Chemists should advise patients to go back to the doctor and
					request a neat prescription. Provisions should be made to
					report to the state medical council and professional bodies
					like the Indian Medical Association if illegible prescriptions are
					received even after requesting legible ones from a particular
					doctor. Collective efforts and awareness will go a long way in
					ending the growing problem of illegible handwriting among
					medical professionals and saving precious lives.
