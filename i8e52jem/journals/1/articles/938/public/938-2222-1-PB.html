				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					This article proposes the establishment of a prize fund to
					incentivise public health research within the BRICS association,
					which comprises the five major emerging world economies:
					Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. This would stimulate
					cooperative healthcare research within the group and, on the
					proviso that the benefits of the research are made freely available
					within the association, would be rewarding for researchers. The
					results of the research stimulated by the prize would provide
					beneficial new healthcare technologies, targeting the most
					vulnerable and needy groups. The proposed fund is consistent with
					current international patent law and would not only avoid some
					of the problems associated with the "Health Impact Fund", but also
					create a new model for healthcare research.

				<p>
					The dawn of the 21st century has seen the emergence of a
					new global grouping consisting of five of the world's largest
					and fastest-developing economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China
					and South Africa (known collectively as BRICS). Together, they
					account for approximately 40% of the world's population and
					have a combined gross domestic product of USD 15 trillion.
					Since 2009, the heads of state of BRICS have been holding
					annual summits.1
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the geographical and cultural differences between
					them, the BRICS countries face certain common and pressing
					public health challenges. These include the prevalence of
					communicable diseases, such as HIV and malaria, as well as
					burgeoning incidence rates of lifestyle-based diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. The effectiveness of public
					health relief programmes in these countries is often hampered
					by the absence of universal healthcare, and the expense of
					purchasing branded medicines <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kulik J.

				</p>
				<p>
					The pressure of dealing with these challenges has a knockon
					effect on the extent of the compliance of BRICS with
					international patent law. The scores of the BRICS countries,
					with the exception of South Africa, for a recent US Chamber of
					Commerce measure of overall respect for intellectual property
					rights (IPR) were among the lowest <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Global Intellectual Property Center, US Chamber of Commerce.

Available from: http://www.theglobalipcenter.com/measuring-momentum-the-gipc-internationalip-index/" id="2">(2)</a>. Disregard for patent
					law has negative political ramifications and can create investor
					uncertainty. In recognition of these difficulties, the health
					ministers of BRICS held their first joint summit in July 2011. At
					this meeting, they pledged to cooperate to find new ways to
					address their public health challenges <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council on Foreign Relations.

				<p>
					There is a consensus that the current model for medical
					research and the distribution of its results is deeply flawed.
					Medical research is driven predominantly by pharmaceutical
					companies, but their business model incentivises research
					into low-risk, high-return products. The often prohibitive price
					of patented medicines forces countries to produce generic
					counterfeits, in violation of international treaties and norms.
					This, in turn, disincentivises pharmaceutical research into drugs
					that would treat diseases prevalent in the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite these difficulties, the BRICS countries have the
					potential to become world leaders in the provision of public
					healthcare and research in this area. Besides their large and
					growing economies, they are blessed with an abundance of
					both natural resources and scientific expertise. The Amazonian
					rainforest has the world's greatest diversity of medicinal plants,
					the pharmacological potential of which is barely understood.
					Many of these countries have large, clinically naive patient
					populations. China and India between them produce more
					than one million science graduates every year, if one includes
					technology, engineering and medicine within the definition
					of "science" <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Clark SL. The STEM subject push. London: Civitas; 2011 Dec [cited 2013 Oct 26]. Available from: http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/stempush2011.pdf" id="4">(4)</a>. Russia and South Africa have a strong history
					of innovative and large-scale research projects. The university
					sector within the grouping is large, but has yet to fulfil its
					research potential. Although BRICS universities are steadily
					improving in the QS world rankings, they still lag far behind
					their European and American counterparts in terms of the
					number of representatives within the top 400 <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="MIT top in 2012/13 QS World University Rankings [Internet]. Topuniversities.com. 2012 Sep 10 [cited 2013 Oct 26].

				</p>
				<p>
					In this context, the time is ripe for the establishment of a
					collaborative prize fund (hereafter referred to as "the Fund") to
					incentivise research into the development of medicines and
					technologies that benefit public health in BRICS. This would
					be paid for by the national governments and administered by
					a committee, which would have a small number of scientists,
					epidemiologists and policy-makers as its members. The Fund
					would run a regular competition, with prizes being awarded to
					research that has demonstrable benefits in the area of public
					health.
				</p>
				<p>
					Teams of researchers across BRICS would apply to enter the
					competition. Successful applicants would be awarded a grant to defray their research costs. After a certain period of time, the
					results of the research would be entered into the competition.
					The teams responsible for creating the products deemed the
					most beneficial to public health would receive a substantial
					cash prize. The number of prizes awarded and the value of
					each prize would be at the discretion of the awarding body. It
					may be decided that in a given competition cycle, none of the
					entrants merits a prize; on the other hand, the awarding body
					may decide to give awards to a number of different teams, the
					value of each prize being proportionate to the relative merits
					of the entries.
				</p>
				<p>
					All products of the research supported by the Fund would
					become the equal property of the five participating countries
					and must be made publicly available within the group. This
					would allow the benefits to be spread quickly and cheaply
					amongst the group's 2.8 billion members.
				</p>
				<p>
					There would be restrictions with respect to those who can
					enter the competition, and also with respect to the purposes for
					which the cash prize can be used. The research teams must be
					led by public institutions within the BRICS countries, and must
					involve researchers from at least two of the five participating
					countries. In this way, the Fund would encourage both the
					development of publicly accessible research capacities within
					the group, and the strengthening of collaboration between
					BRICS research institutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, by requiring international cooperation, the
					Fund would avoid some of the difficulties involved in judging
					research carried out by teams with a narrowly intra-national
					focus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Companies and international research teams could be allowed
					to "buy in" in order to participate in the system. This would
					allow the research teams to benefit from foreign organisational
					and technical expertise. However, external and private sector
					participation would be limited in a number of ways. First,
					international participants would have to waive patent rights
					for the products of their research. They would, instead, receive
					a share of the prize money (if they are awarded a prize)
					commensurate with their level of participation. Second, the
					research teams would have to be led by public institutions
					within BRICS. This is to ensure that the scheme has a lasting
					impact on the scientific research capabilities of these countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cash prize would be divided amongst the participants on
					the basis of the relative time they spent on the research and
					the amount of resources they contributed. These aspects would
					be agreed upon by the teams before going ahead with the
					research. The prize money must be used for furthering public
					health research. This requirement would ensure that the Fund
					helps to create sustainable multinational research institutions
					within the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					This proposal bears certain similarities to the Health Impact
					Fund (HIF), proposed by Aidan Hollis and Thomas Pogge <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hollis A, Pogge TW. The Health Impact Fund: Making new medicines accessible for all [Internet]. Incentives for Global Health; 2008 [cited 2013 Oct 26]. Available from: http://machif.com/wp-content/ uploads/2012/11/hif_book.pdf" id="6">(6)</a>.
					There are numerous versions of the HIF in the literature, but
					all of them share the contention that the current system of
				</p>
				<p>
					proprietary patent rights ought to be replaced with a global
					system of incentives, according to which developers of medical
					technology are remunerated for their work in direct proportion
					to the global health impact of their invention <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Health Impact Fund. Available from: http://healthimpactfund.com/ discussion-papers [cited 2013 August 12]" id="7">(7)</a>. This system
					incentivises researchers to find maximally effective solutions to
					widespread health problems, without reference to the ability of
					the patient to pay for treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, HIF proposals suffer from two serious drawbacks. The
					first of these relates to the requirement that the healthcare
					impact of every proposed technology be measured. The
					canonical form of the HIF recommends the creation of a global
					body, funded by the nations of the world and tasked with
					overseeing the distribution of money to those responsible for
					the creation of health technologies in proportion to the public
					health benefit of their inventions <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hollis A, Pogge TW. The Health Impact Fund: Making new medicines accessible for all [Internet]. Incentives for Global Health; 2008 [cited 2013 Oct 26]. Available from: http://machif.com/wp-content/ uploads/2012/11/hif_book.pdf" id="6">(6)</a>. This body is expected
					to evaluate, or conduct research into, the consequences of
					every single health technology in the world that could have
					been patentable, and to distribute money on the basis of that
					research. Given the number of health technologies in use at any
					one time, the confluence of the various factors at work in public
					healthcare and the time scales involved in health interventions,
					measuring the health impact of any given technology would
					be extremely difficult, if not impossible <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pogge TW, Hirsch-Allen J. Inside views: A response from the authors of the Health Impact Fund [Internet]. Intellectual Property Watch. 2011 Oct 3 [cited 2013 Oct 26]. Available from: http://www.ip-watch.org/2011/10/03/a-response-from-the-authors-of-the-health-impactfund/" id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second weakness of the HIF stems from the proposal to
					compensate healthcare technologies in direct proportion to
					how far they benefit public health. In ordinary models, this
					means that a medicine which eradicates a disease entirely will,
					in the long term, be rewarded less than one which treats the
					symptoms of a disease without eradicating it. This is due to
					the fact that it is the latter medicine, and not the former, which
					will have a direct effect on the health of future generations. A
					further consequence of the HIF proposal is that there is no limit
					to the amount of money an individual or private enterprise
					can earn from a healthcare technology. Thus, if a certain
					company A stumbles upon a cure for, say, malaria, it will earn an
					astronomical amount of money. On the other hand, if a certain
					company B labours over a drug which makes an incremental
					improvement in the treatment of HIV, it will earn significantly
					less. Although there are differing views on this point, it may be
					argued that a more just distribution of resources would cap the
					amount of money given to A and increase the compensation
					given to B.
				</p>
				<p>
					These two difficulties stem from the fundamental presumption
					of the HIF proposal, viz, that individuals should be compensated
					for the products of their work in direct proportion to the
					objective (positive) consequences of the work. For this reason,
					it would be difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a version
					of the HIF which avoids them entirely. By contrast, a prize
					Fund such as that suggested herein would avoid both these
					difficulties.2 Since it would be run as a competition between
					a fixed number of research teams, the administrative burden
					would be manageable. The administrators of the Fund could
					restrict the number of possible entrants, as well as set the
					criteria for success in the competition. Furthermore, since
					the Fund would offer prizes for the most promising research, there would be no need to tailor the remuneration to make it
					in direct proportion to the health impact of each submission.
					Rather, the Fund would appoint an international panel of
					judges to determine which products merit rewards, and to set
					rewards at a reasonable level.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, unlike the HIF, the proposed Fund would not
					apportion money on the basis of objective criteria, such as the
					actual impact on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Rather,
					the awarding body would have substantial leeway to develop
					subjective criteria for awarding prizes, which can include, for
					example, the expected impact of the product on QALYS, the
					innovativeness of the product and its potential for flow-on
					research. So long as the awarding committee is transparent
					about the criteria used and applies them impartially, there is
					nothing morally objectionable about the use of less objectively
					measurable criteria. Indeed, it may be argued that the protean
					nature of the concept of "public health" makes truly objective
					measurement impossible and that it is, therefore, better to
					defer to the informed decision of a panel of experts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Supposing that the Fund were successful, the question would
					then arise as to what a global system modelled along these
					lines would ideally look like. The Fund could be developed in
					one of two alternative ways. On the one hand, it could be that
					the best way to globalise the system would be to expand the
					membership of the Fund to include all the nations of the world.
					In this case, all countries would contribute to a joint prize fund,
					which would be used to reward successful entrants on the
					basis of some predetermined criteria. Let us call this the "single
					global Fund alternative". Alternatively, it might be that the
					most effective way to extend the scheme would be through
					the creation of similar parallel funds, with different national
					groupings (for example, an EU group and an Americas group).
					Let us call this the "multiple Funds alternative".
				</p>
				<p>
					When we consider these alternatives, we must also consider the
					interrelated question of whether the countries participating
					in the Fund would assert IP rights over the products of the
					research, or whether they would make the results of the
					research freely available to all.3 If these two questions are
					taken together, we arrive at four potential scenarios: (i) a single
					global Fund with asserted patent rights; (ii) a single global
					Fund without asserted patent rights; (iii) multiple Funds with
					asserted patent rights; and (iv) multiple Funds without asserted
					patent rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatives (i) and (ii) resemble the HIF proposal, with the
					exception that, as stated, a single global Fund does not require
					the abolition of patents on healthcare technology. (Even
					in alternative (ii], the Fund owns patent rights, but simply
					undertakes not to enforce them.) Thus, a global Fund would
					rival the current model of patent-driven research, and would
					not necessarily replace it. Rather, it would simply promote
					publicly funded researchers, who would be in competition with
					their privately funded counterparts.
				</p>
				<p>
					In scenario (iii), a number of different multinational Funds
					would run their own individual Funds, with each Fund owning and asserting IP rights over the products of the research yielded
					by their competition. These groups could then trade patent
					rights, or else enforce them and use the profits to replenish
					their funds. This would be a sort of halfway house between the
					current system of privately owned patent rights and HIF-style
					proposals which involve jettisoning healthcare IP entirely. In
					this system, although profits could be made from healthcare,
					they would go predominantly, if not entirely, to governments
					rather than private individuals.4 As well as ensuring that the
					profits made from research are distributed more justly than
					they would if they were distributed only amongst individuals
					or the shareholders of private companies, another benefit of
					publicly owned patents is that in principle, the utilisation of
					these patents is under democratic control.
				</p>
				<p>
					On alternative (iv), by contrast, there would be multiple Funds
					but the results of the competitions would not involve the
					assertion of patent rights. In this case, a series of (relatively)
					nimble multinational research competitions would run
					concomitantly, each promoting research that targets problems
					common to the particular grouping, but each making the fruits
					of their research freely available to whoever might need it.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is beyond the scope of this article to adjudicate between
					these alternatives. It is sufficient simply to note that the
					proposed Fund is consistent with all four scenarios. One
					virtue of the proposal is that it would provide a valuable
					testing ground for some of the ideas which drive more radical
					proposals, such as the HIF. Another virtue is that the Fund,
					particularly in forms (ii) and (iv), provides a challenge to the
					current profit-driven healthcare research model. In this way, the
					Fund would weaken the patent-driven economy and may mark
					the beginning of an incremental process towards the complete
					abandonment of healthcare IP.
				</p>
				<p>
					Irrespective of how it might evolve, the Fund would act as a
					powerful driver for research and innovation in universities and
					research institutions within BRICS. Due to its combination of
					both collaborative and competitive elements, it would provide
					a further incentive for researchers to concentrate on the
					development of solutions for pressing public health problems.
					In this way, an important step would be taken towards the
					institution of a form of health research that is oriented towards
					global benefit rather than profit.5
