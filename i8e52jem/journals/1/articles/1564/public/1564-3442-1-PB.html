				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Second opinion refers to  the practice of a second physician evaluating the patient for the same medical  problem to give another opinion on the diagnosis or the proposed plan of care.  The patient, the physician or a third party payer such as a private insurance  company or the government may seek a second opinion. The patient may be  apprehensive about a suggested invasive procedure, or unhappy with the care  being provided. The primary physician may disagree with a consultant. A  consultant may seek another opinion in a complicated condition, or where the  patient is perceived as demanding or litigious. The prevalence of 'second  opinion' is difficult to determine accurately: often the patient may not let  the consulting physician know, for a variety of reasons, that a second opinion  is being sought and accurate data on referral source are rarely maintained. In  USA, increased patient education about their rights, high number of malpractice  lawsuits and lately cost containment issues have led to increased use of second  opinion programmes particularly for invasive procedures. Thus, improved quality  of care, cost containment and increased patient satisfaction are the major  reasons for establishing a second opinion programme.

				<h4>Reasons for seeking a  second opinion</h4>
				<p>
					We performed a Medline search with 'second opinion' as the primary search field  restricted to all English language publications from 1987 to 1997 to review  published literature. The search yielded 19 references. Of these, we selected  17 representative articles for further review.

					Concerns with the high number of coronary artery bypass graft  (CABG) surgeries in the US led Graboys and co-workers <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Graboys TB, Headley A, Lown B et al: Results of a second opinion prograrn for coronary artery bypass graft surgery Journal of the American Medical Association 1987; 258: 1611-1614." id="1">(1)</a> to examine outcomes  in 88 patients referred for a second opinion for CABG. The patient, his/her  primary physician or an insurance carrier sought the second opinion. Based on  published guidelines from large multi-centre studies, 74 patients (84%) were  advised to defer surgery and continue medical management. Sixty of the 74  patients (81%) elected to follow this advice. The patients were followed up for  28 months. Patients who continued medical therapy as advised did not experience  any adverse outcomes as compared to those who opted for surgery. A review of  the subsequent Letters to the Editor showed that most concurred with the  authors that a second opinion was invaluable where surgery was contemplated.  However, a few considered the sample non-representative and therefore the  results not generalisable. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Renner WF: A second opinion program for coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Journal of the American Medical Association 1992; 268: 2537-2540." id="6">(6)</a> They reported on 171 patients who were recommended coronary  angiography, and found that almost 80% did not need it. At a mean follow up of  46.5 months, only 15.4% ultimately underwent coronary bypass or angioplasty,  showing that in the majority of cases, angiography was either unnecessary or  could be safely postponed. As expected, this generated a storm of protest. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Folland ED: Second opinion trial in patients recommended for coronary angiography. Letters to the editor. Journal of the American Medical Association 1993; 269: 1503." id="7">(7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bernstein SJ, Hilborne LH, Leape LL: Second opinion trial in patients recommended for coronary angiography.

Some felt that patients who seek second  opinion are a dissatisfied group for many reasons, and others expressed concern  that the lay press would focus on the conclusion and generate inflammatory and  provocative headlines. Influenced by such studies the insurance industry  developed mandatory second opinion programmes that hoped to avoid 'unnecessary  surgery'. Rosenberg et al <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rosenberg SN, Gorman SA, Snitzer S et al: Patients' reactions and physician patient communication in a mandatory second opinion program. Medical Care 1989; 27: 466-477." id="12">(12)</a> assessed patients' opinions about one such  programme in New York in 1984. Patient responses were obtained by anonymous  surveys and included satisfaction with the second opinion programme. The  patient's report of advice given was compared to what the consultant had  actually advised. 83% of patients found the programme beneficial. Apart from  providing reassurance, the second opinion helped them decide whether to have  surgery and gave them an opportunity to ask questions. In 12%, the advice  reported by consultants did not match the advice reported by their patients.  These instances occurred mainly when the patients felt that the consultant's  communication skill was less than optimal. Also, discrepancy between what the  patient heard and what the physician said depended on the level of complexity  of the advice. As expected, there was less discrepancy when there was a simple  complete agreement or disagreement with previous advice. Discrepancy was  greater when a complex advice incorporating need for additional tests, a 'wait  and see' approach, a different type of surgery or medical management in place  of surgery was recommended.

				<h4>Reducing costs and  unnecessary surgery</h4>
				<p>
					If cost containment is the main reason for looking at elective surgery, then  perhaps one needs to scrutinise only those procedures that are very expensive  or those that are high volume. Barr and her colleagues <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Barr JK, Schacter M, Rosenberg SN et al: Procedure-specific costs and savings in a mandatory program for second opinion on surgery. Quarterly Review Bulletin 1990; 16: 25-32." id="13">(13)</a> looked critically  at the cost -benefit ratio in 5,108 patients participating in a mandatory  second surgical opinion programme. They found that fewer than 10% of  consultations did not confirm the initial opinion. Most of the non-confirmation  occurred for procedures such as prostatectomy, breast or back surgery where  there is considerable disagreement among physicians about the optimal treatment  for these diseases. The cost benefit ratio was high for some expensive  procedures such as hysterectomy and back surgery but was negligible for other  procedures such as cataract or tonsil/adenoid surgery. The authors recommended  that mandatory second opinion programmes be restricted to procedures that are  very expensive or may have serious health consequences.

				<p>
					Meyers <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meyers AD: Second opinion programs: Time for another opinion? Archives of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery 1991; 117: 474." id="14">(14)</a> warned that although second opinion programmes were  initiated to improve quality of care or weed out 'unnecessary' surgery, of  late, the emphasis had shifted solely to cost containment. He pointed out quite  rightly that there was little research on long-term outcome for patients who  defer or refuse a surgery based on the second opinion. In a rush to contain  costs, were we sacrificing patient's rights?
				</p>
				<p>
					In a setting where invasive procedures are not an issue, second  opinion is still valuable, particularly for chronic diseases. Also, contrary to  prevalent opinion, patients with functional diseases shopping endlessly do not  form the bulk of such practice. This was the conclusion of Sutherland and  colleagues who looked at a university based gastroenterology clinic in Canada  to study the group characteristics of those who seek a second opinion <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sutherland LR, Verhoef MJ: Patients who seek a second opinion: Are they different from the typical referral? Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology 1989; 11: 308-313." id="15">(15)</a>.  Only 7% of their clinic population had come for a second opinion. Those seeking  a second opinion had more chronic disease, had spent more time in a hospital in  the past year, and perceived their health as poor. Sixty percent of patients  felt dissatisfied with the physician, either because they felt that the  physician had not spent enough time with them or that the physician had not answered  all their questions. Thirty percent of patients wanted to confirm the opinion  given by the first physician. The decision to seek a second opinion appeared to  be uninfluenced by family or friends. There was agreement between consultant  and referring physician on the diagnosis in the majority of cases. To the  surprise of the researchers, patients with functional disease were not  preponderant.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors looked at the same clinic in 1992 <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sutherland LR, Verhoef MJ: Why do patients seek a second opinion or alternative medicine? Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology 1994; 19: 194-197." id="16">(16)</a>, 5 years after  their first study and found an increased incidence of patients (16%) seeking a  second opinion. Those who perceived their health as poor, those who felt that  their health was under their control, and those who demanded to know all  modalities of available treatment were more likely to seek a second opinion.  Commenting on the cost-containment issue, the authors pointed out that when a  patient does not have to pay, as in the Canadian system where all patients get  free care, second opinion is likely to be patient driven. Even though the cost  of evaluating these second opinion patients was no different than the cost for  those seeing the gastroenterologist for the first time, the overall cost to the  system would increase with greater use of second opinion. Therefore the authors  recommended that if the Canadian system wanted to decrease the use of second  opinion then future studies of second opinion programmes should include  comprehensive measures of patient satisfaction to identify specific sources of  dissatisfaction and devise ways to address these issues.

				<h4>Ability to change  medical practice</h4>
				<p>
					Second opinion programmes are capable of changing physician practice patterns  through education and not just through external pressure. This was the finding  of a study by Asaph et al <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Asaph JW, Janoff K, Wayson K et al: Carotid endarterectomy in a community hospital: a change in physicians' practice patterns. American Journal of Surgery 1991; 161: 616-618." id="17">(17)</a> who retrospectively reviewed carotid endarterectsmy  (CEA) performed over a 22-month period in a community hospital. Of these 56%  were for asymptomatic patients with 37% having stenosis less than that  considered needing surgery according to guidelines based on a national study.  These findings and the guidelines were widely publicised in the hospital. This  prompted the hospital's surgical department to develop internal criteria for  CEA, including a supporting second opinion from a disinterested vascular  surgeon or neurologist. In the following 21 months, there was a 36% reduction  in CEA, thus demonstrating a reduction in 'unnecessary' surgery.

				<h4>Relevance in India</h4>
				<p>
					What relevance does second opinion have for India? The prevalence of second  opinion in India is unknown. The frequent anecdotes of unnecessary and  inappropriate care at all levels in government and private practice settings  suggest that such a programme would be greatly beneficial. The primary  beneficiaries would be the patients. The honest and competent legitimising of  physicians would also benefit from the their recommendations by disinterested,  qualified, personnel. Fear of scrutiny and legal action may reduce unethical  recommendations for tests and procedures. Scarce resources of a government or  charitable institution would be better utilised. But who will initiate such a  programme? The government has shown only minimal interest in providing quality  medical care to urban and rural poor. The insurance industry may in future  initiate such programmes if it finds that escalating cost of medical care is  outstripping its ability to recoup this cost via insurance premiums. But the  insurance industry is a very small player in today's medical scene. The  majority of medical care in India is private practice, which is mostly  unregulated through inaction by the watchdog medical councils. Only patients  who pay for their medical care out of their own pockets can demand and bring  about change in physician behaviour.
