					We read with interest the recent editorial <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Srinivasan S. Ethics of 'standard care' in randomised controlled trials of screening for cervical cancer. Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Jul– Sep;10(3):147&ndash;9." id="1">(1)</a> in the IJME on the
					ethics of standard care in screening trials for cervical cancer
					in India. The author takes exception to the fact that three
					cervical cancer screening studies in India used no screening
					as the control arm, in spite of evidence that the Pap smear
					is an effective screening tool. The author argues that the Pap
					smear should have been the standard arm in these trials, and
					that it was unethical to "withhold" this screening method from
					participants in the control arm of the trial. At the outset, we
					wish to declare a conflict of interest in our response by virtue
					of being investigators of one of the aforesaid trials, but feel it
					necessary to clarify certain facts that have been overlooked.
					First, during the consent process, all women in the Mumbai
					trial (control and intervention arms) were counseled on Pap
					smear testing, given information on the centres nearby that
					offered the Pap smear and assured that they were free to get
					themselves screened if they so wished. Second, the author's
					assertion that visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) had
					already been proven to be effective on the basis of crosssectional
					studies, and that there was no need to perform
					randomised trials to prove that it was effective, lacks scientific
					credibility. The hierarchy of medical evidence places the
					randomised trial at level 1, or providing the highest level of
					evidence, whereas that yielded by cross-sectional studies is
					considered to be level 4 evidence, ie evidence that is unreliable.
					Major national public health policy decisions are always made
					on the basis of randomised level 1 evidence. Prior to our study,
					there had been no randomised evidence that VIA performed
					by trained primary health workers (who are the only healthcare
					providers available for the vast majority of the poor in rural and
					urban areas) leads to cervical cancer mortality reduction. In
					fact, an earlier study had shown that neither the Pap smear nor
					VIA had led to a decrease in mortality due to cervical cancer in
					India <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sankaranarayanan R, Nene BM, Shastri SS, Jayant K, Muwonge R, Budukh AM, Hingmire S, Malvi SG, Thorat R, Kothari A, Chinoy R, Kelkar R, Kane S, Desai S, Keskar VR, Rajeshwarkar R, Panse N, Dinshaw KA. HPV screening for cervical cancer in rural India. N Engl J Med. 2009 Apr 2;360(14):1385– 94. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0808516." id="2">(2)</a>. Should we not obtain robust level 1 evidence before
					making a major public health decision to offer VIA as a routine
					screening method to all women in India?
				</p>
				<p>
					Before commencing with the trial, the choice of no screening
					for the control arm was discussed with several experts at the
					national level. Three points are noteworthy. First, the Indian
					Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Ministry of Health
					and Family Welfare, Government of India had concluded that
					there was a dearth of facilities for nationwide screening for
					cervical cancer using the Pap smear, and had made a projection that even with a twelve-fold increase in staff trained in Pap
					smear, only a quarter of the eligible women in India could
					be screened <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh V, Sehgal A, Luthra UK. Screening for cervical cancer by direct inspection. BMJ. 1992;304:534&ndash;5." id="3">(3)</a>. The report emphasised the urgent need for
					alternative methods of screening and suggested that visual
					examination of the cervix be evaluated <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh V, Sehgal A, Luthra UK. Screening for cervical cancer by direct inspection. BMJ. 1992;304:534&ndash;5." id="3">(3)</a>. Second, a WHO&ndash;
					Government of India committee reiterated the points made in
					the ICMR report and, in view of the fact that the infrastructure
					and resources did not permit a nationwide Pap smear-based
					screening programme, stressed the need for the identification
					of an alternative method that was "scientifically correct, ethical
					and feasible" in India <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India &ndash; World Health Organization Collaborative Programme (2004&ndash;2005). Guidelines for cervical cancer screening programme [Internet]. Chandigarh: GoI-WHO; 2006 Jun [cited 2013 Aug 28]. Available from: http://www.rho.org/files/WHO_India_CCSP guidelines_2005.pdf." id="4">(4)</a>. Finally, a report from the Center for
					Risk Analysis, Department of health policy and management,
					Harvard School of Public Health affirmed that the Pap smear
					was difficult to implement in developing countries and
					suggested that alternative strategies be considered <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goldie SJ, Kuhn L, Denny L, Pollack A, Wright TC. Policy analysis of cervical cancer screening strategies in low-resource settings: clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. JAMA. 2001 Jun 27;285 (24):3107&ndash;15. Erratum in:JAMA. 2001 Sep 5;286(9):1026." id="5">(5)</a>. Using
					mathematical modelling techniques, the report went on to
					compare the cost-effectiveness of the Pap smear, direct visual
					inspection of the cervix and human papilloma virus (HPV)
					DNA testing. The efficacy of once-in-a-lifetime screening with
					HPV DNA and direct inspection was almost identical (27% and
					26% reduction in the incidence of cancer, respectively), and
					was superior to that of the Pap smear, which was 19%. The
					incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the three techniques,
					when implemented three-yearly, was $460 per year of life saved
					(YLS) for visual inspection, while that of HPV DNA testing was
					25 times higher, at $11,500 per YLS, and that of the Pap smear
					was even higher. The paper concluded that the Pap smear
					was the least effective and the most expensive amongst the
					techniques tested.
				</p>
				<p>
					It becomes clear from the expert reports that the Pap smear
					cannot be considered the standard of care in India, not only
					because of the lack of infrastructure and trained manpower,
					but also because it is not cost-effective. The results of our study
					showed that VIA screening reduced the death rate from cervical
					cancer by 31%, ie 1 in 3 deaths were prevented. In addition, the
					study detected a very large number of pre-invasive cancers,
					which were easily treated by outpatient procedures. The
					latter suggests that in addition to a reduction in mortality, VIA
					screening promises to markedly bring down even the incidence
					of cervical cancer in this group in the future. Thus, the results
					of our study, if implemented widely, would save thousands of
					lives globally in the developing countries. In fact, the Wall Street
					Journal, while covering the plenary presentation of our study <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shastri SS, Mittra I, Mishra G, Gupta S, Dikshit R, Badwe RA; Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.

					There has always existed a healthy tension between ethics and
