					It has been reported  from the Idukki district of Kerala at Poomala tribal settlement that 45 persons  sold their kidneys and 30 received advance payment for the same. In Kerala,  there are 20-80 renal transplantations per month from live donors, mostly done by  private, for-profit hospitals <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhyamam, June 21, 2002." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This issue created a lot  of commotion in the media and political and medical field. The Kerala State  Health Department closed the chapter after satisfying itself with a cursory  enquiry by the police which suggested that 'there is nothing legally wrong in  the case records in the hospitals accused'.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Kerala, 13 hospitals  spread over six districts perform renal transplants. Four government and three  private hospitals perform only related donor transplants. The remaining six  private hospitals do transplants of unrelated as well as related donors. Till  October 2002 there were 1,178 renal transplantations carried out in Kerala. Of  these, 488 were from unrelated donors. One hundred and thirty-five of 183  transplants performed in the accused hospitals in Kozhikode were from  unrelated donors.

				<h4>Findings of the police enquiry</h4>
				<p>
					Sources reveal, on conditions of anonymity, certain conclusions of the 'police  enquiry report' which the state government is keeping under tape. Nearly 20  persons, the majority of them poor and uneducated, traded their kidneys for  money. Most of them contacted a 'middle man' through whom the transactions were  discussed and finalised. They sold the kidney as an option to overcome their  immediate financial difficulties. There is evidence to show the involvement of  a few doctors. Under the state Act, every transplantation from a live donor who  is not a relative of the patient has to be screened by the 'Authorisation  Committee' to ensure that there was no payment involved and the donor is acting  with altruistic motives. Although all the cases were approved by the  Authorisation Committee there was no evidence of the involvement of any of the  members of the Committee <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frontline, October 25, 2002" id="2">(2)</a>.

					As 'kidney trade' was  evident in the preliminary committee sitting, the state branch of the Indian  Medical Association (IMA) deployed an enquiry committee on this issue. The  draft report indicated large-scale kidney rackets operating in Kerala. An  important finding was that a woman donor had undergone a medical termination of  pregnancy (MTP) conducted by a lady doctor. But the final report published by  the IMA State Committee was 'white-washed'. It found nothing irregular about  the kidney transplantations. There were protests against this 'correction' from  the IMA itself under the leadership of Dr Mohammed Ali who was the chairman of  the Ethics Committee and had conducted the enquiry and prepared the draft. The  IMA leadership finally expelled the doctor and the issue was in court.

					For years India has been  known as a 'warehouse for kidneys' and has become one of the largest centres  for kidney availability. To curb the unethical trade of human organs and  promote legal transplantation, the Indian Parliament adopted the  'Transplantation of Human Organs Act' in July 1994 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International digest of health legislation. World Health Organization, Geneva: 1991;42:390-396." id="3">(3)</a>. It was concerned with  the removal, storage and transport of human organs. Brainstem death was  accepted as death when diagnosed by a skilled person at the bedside without  sophisticated instruments. The law mentions people who are competent to certify  brain death and removal of human organs and the hospitals registered for  removal, storage and transplantation. This allows removal from related or  unrelated cadavers, live donation from first-degree relatives and unrelated  persons in case of a dire necessity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In spite of this law,  the use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs and new surgical techniques boosted  kidney transplant activities in the atmosphere of loose medical ethics. Many  have sold their kidneys to build houses, feed their families and wed their  daughters. Many 'kidney tours' and 'kidney marriages' have taken place between  people. In 1995, a customs officer of Delhi uncovered hundreds of 'kidney  tours' to foreign countries. In the same month, it was discovered that commercial  trade in kidneys occurred among the residents of a leprosy rehabilitative  colony in Chennai. Later, the police uncovered a massive racket in Bangalore in  which the kidneys of nearly 1000 unsuspecting people were removed in a leading  city hospital <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Das B.

					The organ trade within  and outside the country is very difficult to prevent among the rich as there  are many loopholes and grey areas in the law, and poverty is all too common <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gabr M.

				<h4>No monitoring</h4>
				<p>
					Indian law permits live donation from non-relatives; this is mostly misused for  commercial interests. The lacuna in the law was that the screening committee  had no mechanism to find out the whereabouts of the donor and whether the donor  was truly altruistic. In most cases, the donors were well coached by the middle  man before the screening procedure. There is no system in place that can  effectively monitor the transplantations. If the organ trade is not controlled,  disappearances, especially among street children, violences and baby kidnapping  rackets may flourish along with the theft of organs of executed criminals in  future. The people may lose trust in the medical community and may suspect  their involvement in premature declaration of death on seeing a signed donor  card <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Darr AS, Marshal P. Culture and psychology of organ transplantation. World Health Forum; 1998;19:124-132." id="6">(6)</a>.
				</p>

					Donation of an organ is  most altruistic, meaning an act in life to help another human being and  reliably change the situation of the latter. Even in the UK, 70% of the people  favour organ donation, but only 25% hold donor cards <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gabr M. Organ transplantation in developing countries. World Health Forum; 1998;19:120-123." id="5">(5)</a>. Data from the Arab  world shows that all the 81 renal transplantations conducted during 2001 were  cadaveric donations <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Renal data from the Arab world. Saudi J Kidney Dis Transpl 2002;13:77-81." id="7">(7)</a>. Selling organs demean human beings; there is always  'the rich who receive and the poor who give' <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Darr AS, Marshal P. Culture and psychology of organ transplantation. World Health Forum; 1998;19:124-132." id="6">(6)</a>.

					In India, it is  estimated that there are 80,000 people with severe renal failure and 650  dialysis units are available. Our resources are scarce and the needs outstrip  these <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Das B. Leave life as your legacy. JAMA&mdash;India 2000; 4:31-32." id="4">(4)</a>.The recurrent annual cost of haemodialysis is Rs 1,00,000 and that of  renal transplantation is Rs 75,000-1,00,000. (Dr Pisharody, personal  communication, 2002). We have to weigh the risk-benefit, cost-benefit and  cost-effectiveness ratio in the management of end-stage renal disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					A recently published  World Health Organization (WHO) document made the following points <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Investment for health, investment for development. WHO Document. March 2002." id="8">(8)</a>: Changed  economic policies leading to foreign competition in the health service market  are reducing the access to care for the poor. It appears that health is a  luxury in developing countries. The system of forcing individuals to make  out-of-pocket payments for health care denies basic care to the poorest members  of the society. The above statement is relevant in the Indian context where  there is no social security system and very little public expenditure in the health  sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					Studies have shown that  85% of doctors in India have no training in medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sriram TG, Chatterjee, et al. JIMA. 1991;89:187-190." id="9">(9)</a>. Teaching,  training, following and practising ethics among doctors in our country is the  only solution for the unethical medical problems flourishing in our country  amidst poverty. We have to uplift the four big values in bioethics: autonomy,  beneficence, non-maleficence and distributive justice.
