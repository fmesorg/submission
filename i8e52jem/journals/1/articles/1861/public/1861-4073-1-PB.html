					You have been doing an excellent job of publishing Medical Ethics.

				<p>
					May I point out to you a small 'viewpoint' article by Dr. N. H. Antia, which appeared in The Lancet'?
				</p>
				<p>
					Could you reproduce it in the journal?

					(Dr. Antia's essay is indeed thought- provoking. He analyses the cost- benefit ratio of keyhole operations and questions their relevance in India. We strongly second Dr. Shrotri's commendation of this essay to all our readers. We are unable to reproduce it for want of space.<strong>Editor</strong>)
