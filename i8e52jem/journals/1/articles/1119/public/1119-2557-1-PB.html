				<h4>Finally, action taken on research death</h4>
				<p>
					Three months after 22-year-old Dharmesh Vasava died shortly after he  participated in 'bio-equivalence' tests by Sun Pharma Advance Research Centre,  police arrested two Sun Pharma employees in connection with the death. The  tests were conducted on 30 volunteers, most of whom were paid. Sun Pharma  director Shailesh Desai said that all norms had been followed and that they had  had the required permission for the tests.

				<h4>Human guinea pigs</h4>
				<p>
					Bayer CropScience of Mannheim, Germany, one of the world's biggest chemical  companies, faces an inquiry after it was found to have paid students 450 pounds  sterling, in 1998-2000, to drink fruit juice laced with pesticide. The  Nuremberg Code bans the use of humans for testing poisonous substances that  have no medical application.
				</p>
				<p>
					Volunteers were fed  undisclosed dosages of azinphos-methyl (AM), an organophosphorus chemical. The  blood and nervous system disorders linked to exposure to AM are well  documented. Bayer has not checked on the subsequent health of its human guinea  pigs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The EPA has referred the  studies to an expert panel of the National Academy of Sciences, to get an  opinion 'on whether these human studies are ethically and scientifically  valid'.

				<h4>Pollution punishment</h4>
				<p>
					Four years after the Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998,  were framed by the Maharashtra government, plans are finally afoot for the  Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's (MPCB) first prosecution. Following an  inspection by its regional officer, the MPCB will seek the government's  permission to prosecute a civil surgeon heading the Alibaug Civil Hospital in  Raigad district. According to the guidelines, hospitals are expected to either  incinerate or autoclave biomedical waste. The hospital did not do so; nor did  it install the required equipment or even apply to the government for the  necessary funds.

				<h4>Poor service, poor academics</h4>
				<p>
					The state government-run  1,300-bedded JJ hospital in Mumbai, once the state's premier hospital and  teaching centre, now has idle MRI and ultrasound machines because there is no  money to repair them. Key telephone and fax lines have been cut off and the  morgue was shut down for a year because of unpaid bills. The radiology  department was shut because vital machinery was out of order for weeks and open  heart surgery could not be done for much of the year because the heart-lung  machine had stopped.

				<h4>Graceless medial students</h4>
				<p>
					Eighty-nine medical students in Nashik were remanded to medical custody for a  day for storming the collector's cabin. They had been agitating to demand  revision in the grace marks policy and scrapping of the internal assessment  system. Other demands included elimination of the three-tier fee structure,  revival of the revaluation system and availability of copies of answer books.

				<h4>The ones that got away</h4>
				<p>
					Senior doctors M G Rathod, Mohan Jagde, Chetan Oberoi, V S V Machiswala, Vimal  Kasbekar, S M Haridas and K C Mohanty at JJ Hospital and Grant Medical College,  Mumbai, were accused in 1995 of misusing their official status to aid  underworld elements. All were exonerated owing to the failure of the medical  education department to provide adequate evidence against them.
				</p>
				<p>
					One committee, which  existed only on paper, found no evidence. After another committee confirmed  that the seven doctors under inquiry had links with criminals and recommended  stringent action against them, a fresh probe was launched, which too confirmed that  the doctors were linked to criminals and called for a departmental inquiry and  criminal prosecution as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, medical  superintendent M L Lankeshwar could not provide adequate evidence against the  doctors.

				<h4>Corrupt examiners-same old story</h4>
				<p>
					When Professor B M Sabnis was nabbed while accepting a bribe in April 1994 for  passing a candidate, it seemed that the scandal would compel a cleansing of the  medical examination system. Today, however, he teaches at a government medical  college in Yevatmal and is vying for a plum job in JJ Hospital in Mumbai.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why wasn't stern action  taken? 'While the Anti-Corruption Bureau completed investigations within six  months, the government gave permission to prosecute Dr Sabnis only after three  years. The chargesheet was filed in 1997 and the matter is now in court. 'When  a case comes up after 10 years the students are elsewhere, witnesses have  forgotten and the chances of conviction are much lower,' says A S Samra who  then headed the ACB. Adds a Mantralaya official, 'Public servants are usually  suspended for a year, except in extraordinary circumstances. So after a year Dr  Sabnis was reinstated.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Cases like that of Dr  Sabnis and Dr R G Bhusale-a JJ hospital doctor who was implicated in a paper  leakage scam in 2000 but is back at work today-can only have emboldened others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, at the recent MBBS  examinations, fresh controversies have been thrown up. Students'castes,  political leanings, inter-college rivalry, whimsical, vindictive behaviour by  examiners-and bribery-affected results.

				<h4>Kidney sales in Pakistan</h4>
				<p>
					The kidney trade has assumed alarming proportions in Pakistan, with an illegal  network that extends from villages all the way to hospitals in Rawalpindi. The  stronghold of the brokers is the Sultanpur Mela and the adjoining villages of  tehsil Bhalwal, where hundreds of people have sold a kidney.
				</p>
				<p>
					The governor has  directed the district government here to submit a full report on the sale of  kidneys. DCO Malik Hassan Iqbal told Dawn that his team recorded statements of  various persons and said that people were selling their kidneys only to  overcome poverty and clear their debts. Some did so to release a relative from  bonded labour. Some had to pay for the treatment of a relative who fell ill  after selling a kidney. Poor postoperative care has rendered many unable to  work for a living.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr Tassadaq Hussain  Baloch, member, Punjab Bar Council, called for legislation for curtailing  kidney sales and stressed the need for developing the sense of donation instead  of monetary gain.

				<h4>Missing kidney inquiry</h4>
				<p>
					Three doctors from KEM hospital will inquire into the allegations of medical  negligence and removal of a kidney from a 62-year-old by two doctors of the  civic Mulund general hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					A man was operated upon  at that hospital twice for a hernia. Before the second operation a radiological  testshowed a missing left kidney. After the second operation the victim  suffered from renal failure and later died. His son lodged a police complaint  accusing the doctors of removing his father's left kidney. The police have  charged the doctors with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

				<h4>Tamil Nadu's cottage industry&mdash;kidney transplant</h4>
				<p>
					In almost every one of the 150-odd huts in Namalwarpet on Kunnor High Road in  north Chennai, there's someone who has sold a kidney.
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-related kidney  donations must be approved by the state authorisation committee which must  satisfy itself that the donor is 'emotionally attached' to the recipient and  there is no money transaction between the two.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are 45 recognised  kidney transplant centres in Tamil Nadu including 28 in Chennai, approved by  the authorisation committee. 'We meet only once a week and we are forced to  clear at least 30 cases in each sitting,' says a representative in the committee  from the directorate of health services.

				<h4>Can live unrelated transplants be ethical?</h4>
				<p>
					The Tamil Nadu  government's plans to modify the system of authorising live unrelated kidney  donation are opposed by those who view live unrelated transplants as a trade.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government described  its new plans at a workshop for health professionals and stakeholders in the  regulation of transplantation of organs, organised by the department of  humanities and social sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plans include a  decentralised system and partnership with non-governmental organisations with  greater accountability for the hospital, starting with routing all  transplantation applications through it rather than putting the onus on the  committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this idea  'which is almost ready for final approval' has been opposed by those who view  the existing system of approvals as nothing but commerce in organs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr M K Mani said that  there was no need for the government to collaborate with the trade in kidneys.  Every live unrelated transplant was nothing but trading in the organ,  exploiting the poor. The Act as it stood was unworkable, and there should be a  ban on unrelated donations, he said, demanding greater government emphasis on  cadaver donations as well as preventive programmes for diabetes and  hypertension, both of which were leading causes of renal failure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The state government,  however, is going by the law, which allows live unrelated transplant donation  on the grounds provided for in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994.  There were 20-30 applications each week before the committee from across the state  and it was practically not possible to verify each case for facts, said Ms  Girija Vidyanathan, health secretary.
				</p>
				<p>
					The director of medical  education, C&nbsp; Ravindranath, disclosed that the BBC had reported that  several transplants had been done for British nationals in hospitals in the  state and wanted the government's comment. However, there was no report filed  with the government, indicating that these might not have gone through the  authorisation committee.

				<h4>Dangerous drugs</h4>
				<p>
					Alprax or Alprazolam, a generic anti-anxiety medicine, has become the drug in  demand among urban Indians. Professionals, socialites and housewives reach for  this low-priced drug as a way to still that anxiety tic which is fast becoming  a side-effect of life. Chemists sell the drug freely even though it should be  sold only by prescription. Consumers are unaware that it is addictive and can  produce side-effects like drowsiness, memory loss, slurring of speech and loss  of immunity to infections.

				<h4>Call for an immediate ban on dangerous drugs</h4>
				<p>
					The Delhi High Court  asked the Centre's Drug Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) to examine the safety  of the analgesic Nimesulide, which a petition alleges has been banned  worldwide. The DTAB will find whether the Drug Controller has approved the  drug. The Court also ordered that the manufacture of Astemizole and  Terfenadine, used for skin disorders, be stopped from April 1. Social Jurist,  an organisation of lawyers, has alleged in a Public Interest Litigation that  the government is allowing the manufacture and sale of 'unsafe' drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raman Duggal, the  organisation's lawyer, told the court that Nimesulide was only permitted in  suspensions of 100 mg and 50 mg per ml. Permission was needed for any other  combination but it was being sold in deadly combinations with other drugs. 'The  drug, which is prohibited for children below three, is being used in  combination in other formulations. This is not only illegal but hazardous to  health,' he said. It was only in India that the drug was permitted for use by  children.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Union Health  Ministry in an affidavit earlier had stated that the safety of Nimesulide was  being examined. The DTAB has recommended the phasing out of Astemizole and  Terfenadine within a year. The petition wants the drug to be withdrawn  immediately.

				<h4>Distorting the doctor-patient relationship</h4>
				<p>
					A doctor-client dispute snowballed into a communal flare-up at Warud, Amravati  district, with an attack by Bajrang Dal activists on shops owned by Muslims.
				</p>
				<p>
					Asif Pathan assaulted an  Ayurvedic doctor Shailesh Lokhande, reportedly for causing his wife to lose  sight in one eye. Pathan was beaten up by two Bajrang Dal activists who were  protecting the doctor in anticipation of a possible attack. Pathan went to the  police station and had himself arrested. Later, some doctors, joined by a  3,000-strong crowd, protested the attack on Lokhande. Some Bajrang Dal  activists also attacked property owned by Muslims. Bajrang Dal Vidarbha chief  Subodh Acharya told The Indian Express, 'Lokhande had been receiving threats  for being a VHP activist from Muslims owing allegiance to SIMI, so we had given  him two bodyguards.' He admitted that his men attacked Muslims' shops as a  reaction.
