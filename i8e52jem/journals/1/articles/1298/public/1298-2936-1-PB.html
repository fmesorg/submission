              On May 4, 2001, the  Supreme Court, in a judgement on a Public Interest Litigation filed by Dr. Sabu  George and two organisations (CEHAT, Mumbai and MASUM, Pune), took the  government and other bodies to task for their non-implementation of the  Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act  (PNDT), 1994. The court's directives to various authorities have been reported  widely in the media. The judges made scathing remarks on doctors' behaviour:  "Unfortunately, developed medical science is misused to get rid of a girl child  before birth. Knowing full well that it is immoral and unethical as well as it  may amount to an offence, the foetus of a girl child is aborted by qualified  and unqualified doctors or compounders. This has affected the overall sex ratio  in various states where female infanticide is prevailing without any  hindrance." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Supreme Court Judgment dated May 4, 2001 in the PNDT Act, 1994. Reproduced in Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 97-98." id="1">(1)</a></p>
              <p>
              Since sex selection  procedures require the full complicity of doctors, the Supreme Court did not  put all the blame on civil and medical bureaucracies entrusted with the  implementation of the law. Sensing the court's mood, even as the case was being  heard professional bodies and the health minister (who happens to be a doctor)  used the media to trumpet their commitment to professional self-regulation and  to penalising unethical doctors <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="UNI: Health minister warns against female foeticide. UNI, April 6, 2001." id="2">(2)</a>. The Medical Council of India reportedly  not only warned doctors but also asked the health ministry to revise the code  of medical ethics to enable the de-registration of doctors who continued the  practice <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain Kalpana: Medical bodies to curb female foeticide.The Times of India, August 11, 1999 (it reports IMA's claim that it will make efforts to get licenses of doctors doing sex selection are taken away)." id="3">(3)</a>.</p>

              <h4>Crocodile tears</h4>

              Does such public  posturing by the legal regulatory body (MCI), the dominant professional association  (Indian Medical Association) and the medical politician-health minister have  any credibility? These entities had over 15 years to put their house in order,  in spite of which the Supreme Court found it necessary to give them a rap on  their knuckles. They must be aware that misuse of medical techniques for foetal  sex determination was banned in the public health sector way back in the  mid-1970s. Moreover, the 1994 Act was preceded by a decade-long agitation by  women's groups, health activists and others. Many states have enacted  legislation banning sex selection procedures. In Maharashtra, where the  movement was the strongest, and which took the lead in enacting legislation in  1988, women's groups had also demanded action from the Maharashtra Medical Council.  Representatives of the medical profession were also party to state and national  committees recommending a law against sex selection procedures. In short, the  medical profession and its representatives have long been aware of the issues  being discussed today.</p>
              <p>
              Despite this, rampant  medical malpractice was ignored and guilty doctors went undetected and  unpunished by otherwise highly qualified, resourceful and powerful medical  bodies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
              <h4>Buying time?</h4>
              <p>
              These bodies'  credibility is further dented when the MCI claims that our code of medical  ethics is not adequate, as it does not specifically state that sex selection is  unethical. In a move that would awe the best bureaucrat, the MCI submitted a  proposal to the health ministry for revision of the code. The profession's  leadership is still waiting for the government's green signal to implement  something that the Supreme Court has declared immoral and unethical. Is it not  irresponsible to argue that one needs government sanction to institute ethical  practice? It is obvious that sex selection procedures blatantly discriminate  against the female sex, and contribute in creating a socially dangerous  imbalance in the sex ratio.</p>
              <p>
                Mercifully these bodies  have not challenged the wisdom of preventing the misuse of medical technology &mdash; at least in their public postures. In that case one could have shown them why  medical ethics prohibit discrimination, and why consent given under social  coercion by woman seeking abortion is neither voluntary nor adequately  informed.</p>
            </div>

			  <h4>Surrendering professional autonomy</h4>
			  <p>
			    The medical profession  fights hard to protect its professional autonomy, which is why medical ethics  intrinsically has a strong self-regulatory component. The profession must  recognise that had it kept its house in order and acted to prevent a socially  reprehensible misuse of medical technology, the country's law makers would not  have been persuaded to impose such externally binding laws as the PNDT Act.  There is still time to show the world that the Indian medical profession is not  merely doing business, but that it means business by disciplining its errant  members. Or are we to believe that it is bent on choosing inhuman business  practices at the expense of ethics and autonomy?</p>
