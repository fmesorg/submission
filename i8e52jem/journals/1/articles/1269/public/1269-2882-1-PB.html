				<h4>ICMR guidelines
				finalised</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of Medical Research
					has finalised its ethical guidelines for
					biomedical research in humans. Institutions
					doing biomedical research must set up ethics
					committees to approve research projects
					involving humans. Foetal research, gene
					therapy and international research
					collaborations will require approval from
					national level ethics committees. Somatic
					gene therapy may be used only to tackle
					life-threatening or seriously disabling
					illnesses. There is an indefinite ban on human
					cloning, germline therapy, and on "gene
					therapy to enhance or change normal human
					traits." Dead embryos or foetuses may be
					used for research and as a source of tissues
					with the mother's voluntary and informed
					written consent. Research on embryos older
					than 14 days is prohibited. Only researchers
					who follow the guidelines will be eligible for
					government grants.
				</p>
				<p>
					The national panel which drafted the
					guidelines has recommended that the
					government draws up legislation, listing
					penalties for violation of the guidelines.

				<h4>Private medical
				colleges, public beds-1</h4>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra state exchequer lost at
					least Rs 80 crore over the last decade
					for being charitable to private medical
					colleges, which started without the requisite
					attached hospital, and persuaded the
					government to permit them to use
					government hospital beds, paying Rs 12 per
					bed per day (government order August 3,
					1990). The permission was granted for five
					years, but extended by various governments.
					This year, the government found that each
					bed costs it some Rs 300 per day, including
					medicines, food, linen, equipment, and other
					expenses, and decided to revise the charges
					to Rs 75 per bed per day. The decision came
					into effect on April 1, but was stayed by
					the chief minister on November 9.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the government had charged the amount it
					actually spends on the maintenance of the
					beds, an average of Rs 180, over the decade,
					it would have collected over Rs 80 crore.

				<h4>Private medical
				colleges, public beds-2</h4>
				<p>
					When the D Y Patil Medical College
					was started in 1993, the trust signed an agreement with the state government to
					use the Kolhapur civil hospital's beds to
					teach medical students (to fulfil MCI
					requirements) until it constructed its own
					700-bed hospital. Seven years passed,
					construction did not even begin. The trust
					even applied for alternate use of the land
					sanctioned for the hospital, and went to court
					against the Maharashtra government
					claiming that its agreement with the civil
					hospital runs till April 2003, and that if the
					state government did not abide by the
					agreement, the careers of hundreds of medical
					students would be in jeopardy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the government has sanctioned
					another medical college in the region (the
					backyard of the current health minister) for
					which it proposes to use the Kolhapur Civil
					Hospital.

				<h4>'Charitable' hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Three years after it decided to supply
					subsidised power to 14 high-profile
					hospitals run by charitable trusts in
					Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply
					and Transport (BEST) realised these
					facilities did no charitable work, and
					withdrew the subsidy by which they paid
					just Rs 2 per unit of power against the Rs
					5.50 shelled out by other hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					The subsidy, introduced in July 15, 1997,
					covered hospitals controlled by public trusts,
					religious or charitable institutions registered
					with the Charity Commissioner under the
					Public Trust Act, who exempted them from
					the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's
					(BMC's) General Tax.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The BEST administration reasoned that
					since the BMC had exempted these hospitals
					from paying tax in 1997, the BEST too should
					grant the power subsidy," explains a source
					in the undertaking. The decision to withdraw
					the subsidy follows the BMC's recent
					decision to impose the General Tax on these
					medical facilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					BEST's general manager did not want to
					comment on why the power subsidy had
					been granted as the decision had been taken
					by his predecessor. However, hospitals
					exempt from General Tax will continue to
					receive the subsidy. The BEST committee
					chairperson says that the 14 hospitals will
					be charge regular rates with retrospective
					effect from April 1, 1999, earning the BEST
					Rs 8 crore.

				<h4>Treatment with pleasure

				<p>
					Medical tourism is the latest Health
					Ministry chant to rake in foreign
					exchange, boost the health sector's morale,
					and prop up the ailing tourist industry.
					"We will link allopathic and ayurvedic
					treatment with tourism so that people who
					come for treatment can see the Taj Mahal
					before going home," says Health Minister
					C. P. Thakur.
				</p>
				<p>
					The health ministry and the department of
					Indian systems of medicine and homeopathy
					are identifying centres for accreditation, at
					convenient distances from tourist
					destinations. An official says some
					international tour operators have shown
					interest; one has already sent in his itinerary.

					International patients come to India for
					laser eye surgery, infertility treatments and
					other branches often denied insurance in
					some countries, or considered extremely low
					priority by national healthcare systems in
					others.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Our services are competitively priced, and
					the clinical talent is as good, if not superior.
					With the advent of foreign insurance
					companies, our hospitals will soon reach
					international standards," says Vishal Bali,
					general manager of the Wockhardt Hospital
					in Bangalore.
				</p>
				<p>
					"India can certainly become the healthcare
					destination of the world," says George
					Eapen, CEO, Apollo Hospitals, adding that
					his group is actively targeting the Africa,
					SAARC and West Asia market. "We have
					two great advantages-highly skilled
					manpower and substantially lower costs of
					treatment."
				</p>
				<p>
					A year ago, a UK MP calculated that sending
					British patients to India for treatment could
					save the NHS billions of pounds.

					Some Indian doctors argue that with
					regulation against exploitation of foreign
					patients, we "can offer the British
					government a workable solution." Foreign
					insurance companies might soon start
					diverting patients to India for routine
					surgeries.
