				<h4>Genesis of the NHS  reforms</h4>
				<p>
					The British National Health Service (NHS) of today has its origins in the NHS  Act of 1946, passed in Parliament by the post-World War II Labour Government  of Clement Atlee. The Act very explicitly set out the objectives of the NHS: to  provide an adequate and comprehensive healthcare system, available to all  citizens, funded from taxation, and free at the point of delivery. Aneurin  Bevan, the Health Minister at the time, proceeded to set up an NHS that, over  the years, succeeded in achieving those goals to a very large extent, and  became a model aspired to by many developing nations.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the cost to the exchequer of  providing such a service was considerable, and by 1987 the perception began to  grow that the discrepancy between NHS cash supply and demand had reached crisis  proportions (annual government expenditure on the NHS for 1987-88 was 20  billion pounds). The Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher responded by  setting up a cabinet committee to study ways of reducing costs in the NHS, and  their findings led to the publication in I989 of a white paper called "Working  for patients". <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Secretaries of State for Health, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland: Working for Patients. London: HMSO, 1989" id="1">(1)</a> At the time, the management structure of the NHS-to put it  very briefly-consisted of the Department of Health (i. e. the central  ministry or DOH) at the apex and District Health Authorities (DHAs) and Family  Health Service Authorities (FHSAs) at the ground level. The DHAs and FHSAs were  responsible for the provision of hospital-based care and primary health care  for the residents of that district. To this end, they received an annual sum  from the DOH (determined, among other things, by the number of people resident  in that district) which was then disbursed among the hospitals, general  practitioners (GPs) and other providers of medical care in that district.  Salaries of hospital staff (doctors, nurses, paramedics) and GPs were paid by  the DHAs from these funds, according to uniform pay scales that applied nation-wide, and to all specialities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The principal change proposed by the white  paper related to separating the purchasers from the providers within the NHS.  It was envisaged that the DOH (the funder) would disburse funds to individual  Regional Health Authorities (larger bodies, created by amalgamation of the old  DHAs and FHSAs), and entrust them with the task of purchasing health care for  the population of that area (i. e. they would be the purchasers). The RHAs  would then have the freedom to purchase from whichever providers they felt  could provide a good and economical service. The providers within each area,  particularly the hospitals, would be expected to bid for these contracts. The  hospitals could no longer complacently expect that all patients in their  respective catchment areas would inevitably be referred to them for all  ailments. It was felt that creation of such an internal market would reduce  costs, improve quality, and increase responsiveness of the providers to the  needs of the patients. As a corollary, NHS hospitals were to be encouraged to  opt out from the governing ambit of the Region, and become self-contained,  self-managing Hospital Trusts responsible for their own finances and own  resources. The other major group of providers, the GPs, were to also see  significant changes. GPs with sufficiently large practices were to be given the  option of becoming fund-holder GPs, i. e. they could receive funds directly  from the DOH, and use that budget to provide primary care for their patients,  as well as purchase hospital health care for their patients as required from  local providers. They would, in other words, fulfil dual roles as purchasers  and providers, and Hospital Trusts would have to enter into contracts not only  with the RHAs but also with individual fund-holder GPs in the region. Other  important proposals in the white paper included suggestions for incorporating  some independent (i. e. private) hospitals amongst the providers, and the  creation of indicative drug budgets.

				<p>
					The ideologic drive behind the reforms  proposed by the white paper are thought to have come from the writings of Alan  Enthoven, an American health-care economist. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Enthoven AC: Reflections on the management of the National Health Service. London: Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, 1985" id="2">(2)</a> Further inputs, particularly relevant  to London, were to come in three years' time, from the report submitted by Sir  Bernard Tomlinson in 1992, urging changes in London's healthcare, education and  research infrastructure. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tomlinson R: Report of the inquiry into London's Health Service Medical Education and Research.

				<h4>Effects of the reforms</h4>
				<p>
					Implementation of the reforms commenced from 1991, amidst a lot of sound and  fury. The government pressed ahead despite loud protestations from professional  organisations representing doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers, large  sections of the lay press, patient interest groups and the opposition benches.  The effects of the reforms have been too far-reaching to be grasped in their  entirety as yet, but certain effects are quite apparent already from the  viewpoint of a hospital doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Effects on medical  infrastructure:</em> The overwhelming  majority (perhaps all) of the large NHS hospitals in this country are now  independent Trusts, and have unprecedented financial autonomy. While many have  managed to balance their books and therefore not had to make significant cuts  in services, many others are in the red. These Trusts have been forced into  economising by cutting down on what they perceive as non-essential services.  Closure of wards and in some instances casualty departments has led to  increasing demands on the existing beds and facilities, with longer waiting  times for patients. Recent newspaper reports state that over the past 3 years,  28 out of 60 casualty units in London have been closed down, and there are  warnings of bed shortage crises over the winter months. In some instances, amalgamation  of two or more hospitals has led to the creation of large Trusts, which have  then proposed concentrating all their resources at one site and closing down  the other sites entirely. The bitter struggles that two of London's leading  teaching hospitals-St Bartholomew's and Guy's-have had to fight to avoid  complete closure are prominent examples. A frequently quoted reason for  slashing hospital funding is that the money may be better spent on bolstering  care in the community, but this does not seem to be happening either.  Facilities for geriatric and psychiatric care within the community are a  growing area of concern. Therefore, while the cuts may make financial sense,  and may lead in the long term to fewer, leaner but better-equipped units, in  the short term they are being perceived by NHS staff and lay people as a  cynical means of further slashing the already stretched services, and are  widely unpopular.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Effect on human-power  and morale</em>: Hospitals have also  sought to downsize their workforce as a means of economising. This has led to  job losses, and those who have retained their jobs are left with increasing  workloads, a severe crisis in morale and a growing sense of insecurity. Doctors  in the NHS get paid less than what bankers, lawyers, managers or accountants  may earn in the private sector. The possibility of pay scales being set locally  by the Trusts (as opposed to national pay scales) has generated fears that  already low salaries may be slashed even further. One of the assets of the old  NHS was a zealous and committed workforce that was willing to accept modest  salaries and poor working conditions because of the satisfaction they derived  from their jobs. That ethos is rapidly disappearing. The Trusts have also been  recruiting more managers at the same time that they have been shedding medical  and nursing staff. They have-in all fairness-been forced into this, because  the reforms have unleashed a whole new plethora of managerial problems and  mountains of paperwork (having to negotiate contracts with each individual  fund-holder GP in the region is a case in point). But the growing number of  well-paid "men in grey suits" has helped demoralise the diminishing medical  and paramedical staff even further. Working from cramped offices with poor secretarial  support, they cannot help noticing that the newly appointed managers work from  smart offices and draw attractive perks. There has been a not-so-subtle shift  in power within the hospitals, from the doctors to the managers, and doctors  are certainly not happy about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Effect on medical  practice:</em> With cash shortages  and bed closures, there have been instances where medical care has been  compromised.Patients having to wait for long times in casualty departments  before they can be seen or before a bed can be found for them on a ward, is a  commonly-quoted example (though this particular problem is not an entirely new  phenomenon). There have been instances of cash-strapped Trusts refusing to  offer certain cosmetic operations, fertility-enhancing treatments or very  expensive drugs. Trusts that have run out of funds midway through a financial  year resort to healthcare rationing in various forms: stopping all elective  operations till further funding comes through (thereby leading to longer  waiting lists) is typical. In one recent well-publicised instance, a hospital  refused to admit any patients above the age of 75 years! The issue was resolved  only after extra cash was provided from other sources. The creation of fund-holding GP practices and the perceived need for the hospitals to keep such GPs  happy (or else they may send their patients to another hospital), has led to  concerns about a two-tier system, wherein patients referred by fund-holding  GPs will be given priority on non-medical grounds. On the positive side, there  have certainly been changes in clinical practice which have led to more  efficient utilisation of beds and resources. In the surgical disciplines for  example, the turnover of cases is much more rapid. Patients for elective  surgery frequently have their entire pre-operative work-up done on an  outpatient basis. After surgery too, they spend less time in hospital and are  discharged into the community as soon as it deemed safe. Day surgery is getting  increasingly popular. Groin hernias and laparoscopic cholecystectomies are  routinely being done as 24-hour admissions. Doctors have become more conscious  of the cost of the therapies they prescribe. Units throughout the country are  engaged in clinical audit to ensure that their results measure up to acceptable  standards. Doctors have also become more aware that treatments prescribed by  them should be justifiable on the basis of the best available information in  the medical literature-"Evidence-based medicine" is the new catch phrase.  However, official efforts to quantify medical performance using industrial  rating standards can also extend to the ridiculous-attempts to grade hospitals  with a 1-star to 5-star system (as for hotels) or create league tables on the  basis of overall mortality figures are cases in point.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Patients' expectations</em>: Along with the health reforms, the  Government has also attempted to raise the patients' awareness of their rights,  by publishing a Patients' Charter, which outlines for example the maximum  permissible time one can expect to wait to be seen in a casualty department or  in an out-patient clinic, or the maximum time period one can spend on a  waiting list for an elective operation. Hospitals have by and large attempted  to meet these performance standards, leading to an impressive cut-down on  surgical waiting lists in many instances. But the heightened expectations of  the patients has also led to a remarkable increase in the number of complaints  received against NHS hospitals from aggrieved "customers". In fact, one of the  deplorable consequences (I think) of the prevailing managerial ethos in  hospitals has been the tendency to perceive patients as customers and refer to  them as such.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Effect on research:</em> Usually, research funding is one of the first  casualties of healthcare penny-pinching. This was predicted, and has already  begun to happen. The demoralisation in the ranks of research personnel has been  further compounded-at least in London-by the turmoil resulting from the  reorganisation of medical schools and their affiliated hospitals and research  institutions, as recommended by the Tomlinson report. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tomlinson R: Report of the inquiry into London's Health Service Medical Education and Research. London: HMSO, 1992" id="3">(3)</a> Some remedial efforts  are under way, however. A committee headed by the health economist Professor  Tony Culyer proposed in 1994 that a levy be imposed on all healthcare  purchasers, and the proceeds be used for research funding. This has been taken  on board by the NHS Executive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Fears of  privatisation:</em> The general attitude  of this Conservative government towards all public utilities (they have already  privatised all water, gas and electrical supplies, and much of the railway  system) has led to growing fears that the hidden agenda behind these health  reforms is to gradually impoverish the NHS to such an extent that increasing  numbers of people turn to private healthcare, and then sell off the depleted  remnants to private buyers. Already there is talk of several hospitals being  renovated under the 'Private Finance Initiative' which will invite private  companies to invest in these projects. The Government of course denies these  accusations of backdoor privatisation vociferously, and as evidence of its  commitment to the health sector points to the fact by 1994-95 its annual  spending on the NHS has increased to 39 billion Pounds. Whether there is any  truth to these allegations may be revealed in the fullness of time if the  Tories get elected to another term in office. However, even the Labour Party,  which vehemently opposed the reforms when they were introduced ,now  acknowledges that the changes have been far too extensive for them to consider  a total reversal if they come to power.

				<h4>The role of the  doctors</h4>
				<p>
					The medical fraternity in the UK are represented in most official fora by the  British Medical Association (BMA). While it does command considerable clout and  public respect, the BMA has a poor record when it comes to standing up to a  determined Government. In 1946, the BMA was at first fiercely opposed to the  creation of an NHS, but ultimately caved in to Aneurin Bevan. This time too,  when Mrs Thatcher's ministers opted to bring in such wide-ranging reforms with  little prior consultation with the BMA, and with total disregard for pleas that the reforms be initially  tested in a pilot area or in pilot institutions, the BMA was unable to defend  its position strongly enough or mobilise public opinion effectively in its  support. Doctors now have accepted the reforms and decided to "get on with it".  Many are still disgruntled, but their responses are muted. As one who grew up  in the strident militancy of junior-doctor politics in India, I have in turn  been impressed by how civilised their forms of protest are, and been stunned by  how ineffective they were in the long run.
				</p>

				<h4>Some observations</h4>
				<p>
					Britain is not alone  in suffering these difficulties. Several other countries, including Australia,  New Zealand and Finland are in the process of implementing healthcare reforms  which involve the creation of a similar purchaser-provider split, and they all  have had their successes and their problems. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mason A, Morgan K: Purchaser-provider: the international dimension. British Medical Journal 1995; 310: 231-235" id="4">(4)</a> The difficulties of  introducing free-market concepts into what was so far a state-run venture on  'command economy' principles may strike a familiar chord with Indian observers,  who are after all seeing the same happen with their national economy. If health  workers and health planners in India wish to incorporate some of the principles  of the British NHS into their own healthcare systems, then they would be well  advised to watch how things unfold here, and perhaps learn how to do and how  not to do certain things. Health services cannot be run purely like a business.  A demoralised workforce of health workers and a disgruntled population who view  their NHS in a poor light cannot be reassured by the utterances of a  paternalistic government, or by the sight of growing numbers of managers  grappling with unbalanceable budgets.
				</p>
				<p>
					These NHS reforms have been extremely wide-ranging in their scope, and there have been-not surprisingly-problems associated with their implementation.  Inevitably, such changes are bound  to generate a lot of angst. There have no-doubt been some  obvious benefits, but by and large, the lay public and health workers are not  yet persuaded that things will change for the better. Time will tell. In the  meanwhile, we live in hope.
