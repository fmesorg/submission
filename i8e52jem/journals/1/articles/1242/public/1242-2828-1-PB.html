				<p>
					The workshop (January 19-20, 2002) was jointly  organised by the Kerala Health Studies and Research Centre (KHSRC), Trivandrum,  the Department of Community Medicine at the Medical College, Trivandrum, and  the Forum for Medical Ethics Society, Mumbai. Participants came from all over  the state, representing community medicine, pharmacology and forensic medicine  and various other specialities in private and public practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Joy Elamon</strong>, Executive Director of the KHSRC  said the workshop had been organised in the light of recent research  controversies, in order to discuss some central ethical questions in the  conduct of research.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Uma</strong>, Head of the Department of  Community Medicine at the Medical College, noted that though the public  displayed a keen interest in ethical issues, students had only a vague  understanding of these concepts.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his inaugural address,<strong> Dr C R  Soman</strong>,  director of Health Action for the People, noted that the setting in which  medicine is practised has become more controversial over the years, calling  into question the very foundation of medical practice. The medical profession  is corrupt and bereft of concern for human welfare. Ethics was an integral part  of practice in the traditional systems of medicine. Doctors need to take the  principles of traditional practice to western science. Finally, collaborative  research had grown exponentially since the 1970s, bringing with it a host of  potentially exploitative situations.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr B Ekbal</strong>, vice chancellor of Kerala  University, said though Kerala is a progressive state and the majority of  doctors practice ethically, they are often insensitive when discussing medical  practice. There is little discussion on ethical questions related to various  aspects of medical practice. Even as the profession is reluctant to confront  long-standing ethical dilemmas, new challenges are posed every day by advances  in medical science.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presentations were made on recent unethical trials  and other research controversies, principles governing medical research, the  role of ethics committees, issues in collaborative research, informed consent,  the ICMR's work in developing ethical guidelines, and fraud in medical  research. Small group discussions were held on case studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the presentations which led to animated  discussion was <strong>Ms Neha Madhiwalla's</strong> on informed consent, particularly  in relation to contraceptive research. Ms Madhiwalla noted that written consent  is often seen as a requirement to protect the researcher, instead of a way to  ensure that researchers follow the protocol. It is important to see the ethos  in which we see informed consent. It might be good to get researchers to sign a  commitment to undertake to do their duty.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr G Sujatan</strong>, member of the ethics committee  at the Medical College, discussed some consent forms submitted to the  committee. Consent forms are often confused with patient information sheets,  and both are often incomplete.
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>Communication and consent</em>: <strong>Dr Sujatan</strong> reported that a poorly communicated  consent request for emergency surgery resulted in a suspicion of  negligence/malpractice allegation that the patient had been submitted to a  nephrectomy under the pretext of another surgical procedure. <strong>Dr M Nair</strong> stated  that poor communication is the reason for many allegations of malpractice or  negligence. Dr Nair stated that when he knows an operation involves many risks,  he explains everything to the patient, writes it out in Malayalam, and asks for  written consent. However, there may be situations where there is no time to  take consent. </p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr Amar Jesani</strong> stated  that both consent form and patient information sheet should be in the local  language. While the former is partly to protect doctors, the latter is  something to which participants can always refer later. Ethics committees must  demand that patient information sheets are in the vernacular language and  understandable to the patients. Second, researchers could sign the information  sheet to take responsibility for the information given. Third, the information  sheet should contain the contact details of the ethics committee chairperson  who reviewed the proposal. The ethics committee must expand its work to include  grievance redressal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>What is the procedure for  obtaining consent for screening procedures?</em> A participant observed that family planning clinics  do not take consent for post-partum cervical screening since it is not an  invasive technique and can be included in the clinical examination.  Another stated that treatment policies should be given when obtaining consent  for screening. Another asked: should consent be obtained for 'opportunistic'  screening?
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Should research organisations  reimburse patients for travel/expenses?</em> This is going to be a concern if reimbursement &mdash;  particularly when research is done in poor populations &mdash; acts as an incentive  to participate in a trial.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>HIV testing.</em> Why should the doctor take  consent for testing blood for HIV, which after all is a diagnostic procedure?  The response was: since HIV has a social stigma, testing must be done in the  context of counselling.
				</p>
				<p>
					Retrospective (medical records) studies need  consent only from the institutional head.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Other questions:</em> What are the legal implications  of informed consent? Why insist on equality in research alone?
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Jesani commented that most of the questions were  concerned with legal problems and how to protect the doctor. We should first  think of the patient. We should always take consent, even for physical  examination; the issue is the form in which this consent expressed. There are  certain conditions where it is important to document consent, for example, when  invasive procedures are involved. The problem of communication must be addressed.  We need a culture of giving patients information.
