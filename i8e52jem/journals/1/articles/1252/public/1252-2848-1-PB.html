					This essay is based on issues relating to a study of
					sexuality among low-income college students in
					Mumbai. Low-income students were made the focus
					because: existing urban studies are on English speaking
					students in 'elite' colleges; sex education programmes had
					not really started in 'non-elite' colleges, and these students'
					behaviour could be affected by their lack of resources. Data
					were collected during 1996-1998, from four colleges
					catering to low income students in the city. Boys and girls
					in the eleventh standard in high school and in third year
					undergraduate college were interviewed. In the first phase,
					qualitative data were gathered using 10 focus group
					discussions and interviews with 87 students. This was used
					to design a survey which used a self-administered
					questionnaire. A total of 966 students participated in the
					survey.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anovice in sexuality research may not seriously
					consider the ethical dimensions of such an enquiry.
					S/he is usually more concerned about
					conceptualising the study, choosing the appropriate
					methodology, and working out the logistics involved in
					executing the study. The squestion that haunts the
					researcher is: "Will people talk about their sexual experiences,
					especially about taboos such as premarital sex?"
				</p>
				<p>
					Having no prior experience in such research, I too was
					troubled by this question when starting off, but I was not
					unduly worried because sexual experiences were only one
					part of my study which was meant to explore a range of
					issues related to sexuality- sexual socialisation, knowledge
					and attitudes to sex, peer socialisation, erotic exposure and
					so on. I reassured myself that if people did not share their
					sexual experiences with me, I still would have a lot of useful
					data to analyse. Besides, the refusal to respond tells you
					whether a group is willing to disclose personal information.
					It can also tell us the strengths and weaknesses of
					methodologies for sexuality research.
				</p>
				<p>
					A review of existing sexual behaviour studies showed that
					a percentage of young people report pre-marital sex and
					that more young men report pre-marital sex than young
					women. Some authors attributed this gender difference to
					over-reporting by boys and under-reporting by girls, but
					did not state the evidence for this belief. They apparently
					assumed that girls refrained from admitting pre-marital sex,
					fearing the possible negative consequences of such a
					disclosure. On the basis of my study, I now believe that
					fewer girls than boys actually engage in pre-marital sex, in
					order to avoid various negative consequences: a 'bad name'
					for themselves and their families, the possibility of future
					marital discord and domestic violence, and so on. While
					one must be aware of the possibility of over-reporting and
					under-reporting, it may be best to base one's beliefs on
					sufficient evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of the study, therefore, I was mainly
					concerned about the methodological aspects of gathering
					reliable data, and how to gain students' confidence and trust.
					However, I was not fully prepared for the consequences of
					people disclosing their personal experiences. While
					methodological aspects of the research were considered in
					detail, the ethical aspects of were considered only briefly.
					This has changed in the last five years. Sexuality research
					has tackled many methodological issues and is now
					discussing the ethical dimensions more seriously. Our
					experiences may be useful to ongoing discussions.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>The research team's concerns</h4>
				<p>
					Our first concern was to deal with the methodological and
					ethical problems at our end: Are we comfortable asking those
					questions? Is our language appropriate? What are our
					prejudices? Are we sensitive to young respondents'
					anxieties? How much should we probe into their lives?
					Working on these was a protracted exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					The research team consisted of young men and women
					just out of post-graduate or undergraduate courses &mdash; almost
					a sub-sample of our study sample, similarly biased and ill
					informed on sex and sexuality. But they were very
					enthusiastic and, above all, well informed about the social
					and cultural milieu in which the study was located. Prior to
					data collection, we had meetings on the objectives,
					methodologies and logistics of the study. We spent
					considerable time talking about sex and sexuality, clarifying
					misconceptions and filling in information gaps. We also held
					a two-day workshop on conducting group discussions,
					interview techniques and note taking and transcribing. The
					only ethical issue that the workshop resource people
					discussed was to 'respect' and be 'sensitive' to the
					respondent's views. More detailed discussion on ethical
					issues should have been an integral part of that workshop.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The returns of research</h4>
				<p>
					Although ethical issues were not at the forefront of our
					research concerns, they kept cropping up. During our
					meetings, research staff raised the question of
					appropriateness of our research. They perceived it a onesided
					relationship in which respondents 'give' and the
					researchers 'take'. Are we providing them nothing in return?
					they asked.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the tradition of social science research that I was trained
					in, researchers did not provide anything in return to
					respondents. The returns of research were not perceived in
					terms of their immediate benefits. Benefits accruing from
					such research would result from a lengthy process: research
					findings would enhance our understanding of society, which
					circulates to benefit the whole group. In other words, the
					job of the researcher is to generate critical 'knowledge' that
					has some value for society as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such arguments were not acceptable to my young staff.
					They raised several questions: Why should people spend, their time and put themselves at risk talking to you if you are
					not going to give them anything in return? Is it morally
					correct? It is only natural that they expect something from
					you.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Intervention research</h4>
				<p>
					Looking for a solution to this dilemma, I came across several
					research protocols prepared by international agencies in the
					area of health research, advocating what they call 'an
					intervention component' as part of the study itself. This
					intervention could be by way of services provided after the
					completion of the study, or basic services such as health
					care, counselling, awareness programmes or IEC materials
					provided during the study itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study was one of four studies on adolescent sexuality
					in India, funded by Rockefeller Foundation. The others were
					conducted by agencies already providing services, for whom
					the studies were to feed into their services, making
					'intervention' the overall aim. Our study was to generate
					understanding that would feed into programmes organised
					by various agencies, both government and non-government,
					for youth groups, especially school- or college-based
					programmes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 'intervention component' is increasingly becoming
					part of research conducted outside traditional social science
					research institutions such as universities and special
					centres. I believe that this 'new perspective in research'
					arose in the context of two developments. First, voices were
					raised against the use of the bulk of research funds on
					researchers' comforts even as the respondents lived in abject
					poverty or in stigmatised conditions. Second, as nongovernmental
					organisations (NGOs) became increasingly
					involved in research, some of them criticised 'ivory tower'
					research in favour of more humane research that took into
					account some of respondents' immediate needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					My gut feeling was that this trend of 'built-in intervention'
					has more to do with the politics of large international funding
					for research in poor countries. While this approach seems
					logical and also reflects some ethical concerns, I am not
					sure of its methodological appropriateness or its resolution
					of ethical issues. Could it amount to an inducement to
					participate? And could the anticipation of a reward, however
					small, alter the nature of data? I am still not sure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Social science research has generally held that data
					gathering should avoid any form of inducement as it can
					seriously affect the data. However, researchers are expected
					to intervene in life-threatening situations and other serious
					crises involving respondents, their immediate families, or
					the community, and not remain 'dispassionate observers' to
					'document the outcome'. It seems ethically correct to provide
					services to respondents suffering from reproductive tract
					infections in a study of reproductive health. But what do we
					do in studies of voting behaviour, or of employment
					outcomes?
				</p>
				<p>
					Much social science research is seen as a collaborative
					effort of the researcher and the researched. It is true that
					research findings often do not get translated into benefits
					for the respondents. In many cases, no one pays heed to
					the researcher's findings or the respondents' interests, unless the researcher is backed by influential agencies.
					However, the 'intervention component' may thwart the
					efforts of small-budget studies carried out by individuals in
					lesser-known institutions. Is this a way to make 'ivory tower'
					research redundant, and to promote NGO research? (Of
					course, I do not hold that all institution-based research is
					'relevant' and I do believe that some NGOs are doing 'very
					useful' research.) The intervention component is particularly
					characteristic of large projects. By now we also know that
					conditionalities (hidden or explicit) are attached to largescale
					funding, whether for 'development projects' or
					'research'.
				</p>
				<p>
					A related question is: how is intervention designed? Do
					we ask the respondents what they need, or do we decide
					what to give? What if they really need something which we
					cannot give? What if there are conflicting demands? What
					if most respondents are not particularly concerned about
					the rewards? Such issues in sociological research on
					sexuality become difficult to resolve, while it may be easier
					to do in a more specific health research project.
				</p>
				<p>
					After much discussion within the group we decided that
					we would try 'to do something for the students', based on
					our financial and other capacities as well as students'
					demands. In order not to let it influence respondents'
					decisions to participate, we decided not to announce any
					intervention but informed those who asked about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study's returns may not benefit all respondents
					equally &mdash; or for that matter any of them. However, it may
					have more significant indirect effects. To illustrate, we were
					surprised when the principal of one of the colleges was quick
					to grant permission to conduct the study. Later, he mentioned
					that an unmarried student who became pregnant had been
					"dismissed" from the college at the management's behest,
					an action he felt was "unfair" to the student. He felt sex
					education could help prevent unwanted pregnancies, but
					needed concrete findings to convince the management of
					its need. Here we saw some benefits accruing from our study,
					perhaps not to the participants specifically but to the
					students in general. After the study, our efforts have been
					to communicate the findings to parents at large, educators
					and other agencies, in the hope that it will benefit young
					people. One organisation finds the study useful in its
					programmes for youth in a rural setting. These issues of
					`benefits and relevance' need to be brought to the centre of
					social research, particularly because of the blurred
					boundaries between types of research - market research,
					action research, intervention research, theoretical research
					and so on. The agencies and players in these types of
					research have different agendas and objectives.
				</p>
				<p>
					We tried to meet an obligation to 'pay back' in different
					ways. Wherever possible, we tried to provide information
					on specific topics, and specific services to those respondents
					who asked. We also asked the students if they wanted a
					programme organised for them, and if so, what the content
					should be. Some wanted a meeting with an 'outside expert'
					to answer their personal queries. This was arranged and the
					students seem to have found it useful.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
				<p>
					It was not difficult to convince the research staff of the
					importance of data confidentiality and protecting
					respondents' identity, but I soon realised that this was not
					enough. Most research reports only state that
					'confidentiality of the data' was assured but do not speak
					of how they did this. I realised that these young researchers
					were discussing 'interesting details' with their peers and
					family members, disclosing the identity of the college. At
					the same time, college authorities were pressurising them to
					divulge the names of other colleges where the study was
					being conducted and the staff felt it was 'okay' to share the
					information between colleges. 'Leakages' occurred despite
					many efforts, particularly in the initial stages of the study till
					the staff became habituated to 'guard it as a secret'. It was
					also difficult to ensure that trained staff who leave the study
					for better jobs, continue to maintain confidentiality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respondents' identities were easier to maintain as we did
					not ask their names and their interviews were linked only to
					a code number. However, another problem arose here: after
					the transcriptions, I needed more information in some cases,
					but could not go back to gather it. In an exploratory study
					unanticipated responses come up which need to be followed
					up.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					This seemingly straightforward ethical requirement turned
					out to difficult to implement. One practice suggested for
					literate populations is to obtain respondents' signatures on
					informed consent forms. Our research population consisted
					of highly literate college students (16-22 years), but getting
					their signatures on consent letters seemed to go against our
					assurance of protecting their identities. The most convincing
					way we could assure protection of their identities was by
					not recording their names anywhere. Instead, informed
					consent was operationalised as follows: In order to recruit
					students for focus group discussions, members of the
					research team addressed classes, informing them about the
					study's objectives and our organisation. A meeting was
					announced for those willing to participate in the discussions.
					On the appointed day, many students did not turn up: the
					reasons given by those present were that some changed
					their minds, some were absent, and some were not free. We
					restated the purpose of research and who we were, and how
					we would maintain confidentiality. We said if they wished to
					discontinue, they could do so. We began the group
					discussions a few days later, by which time some more
					students had dropped out. Once the group discussions
					began, the participants stayed on through the multiple
					sessions conducted with each group.
				</p>
				<p>
					This two-layered recruiting procedure may have helped
					ensure the ethical requirement of informed consent. But from
					a sociological angle, I would have been equally interested
					in talking to those who wished to stay away from the
					discussions. Such a self-recruitment procedure is
					methodologically weak as it tends to leave out important
					groups, compromising the validity of data. The objective of
					an exploratory study is to arrive at a general understanding
					of the issue, for which it is important to have as many diverse
					experiences and representations as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly, in individual interviews and in the survey,
					students were informed of the survey's objectives and
					nature, the confidentiality of the data gathered and also about
					us. Their willingness to participate was taken as their
					consent. However, some of those interviewed did not wish
					to answer some of the questions and they were not probed.
					Then, in the self-administered questionnaire, students chose
					not to respond to some of the questions, and the no
					response was recorded. On the whole, once they opted to
					participate the 'no response rate' was low.
				</p>
				<p>
					Looking back, I wonder if our over-enthusiasm to ensure
					that the students' participation was completely voluntary
					('choice' is something which they are not used to in an
					institutional context) actually provoked some students'
					curiosity and generated peer pressure leading to their
					participation. Some students asked to be included in the
					study as their friends had been interviewed. Does this violate
					the rule of `informed consent'? There could also have been
					herd behaviour: "Others are doing it, so I must do it too..."
					Our understanding is that these young people are not used
					to being given choices. Once college authorities permit an
					activity by an external agency, it is expected that students
					cooperate. Of course, students do subvert authority. Besides,
					any activity that is not `compulsory' is generally not seen
					as an important activity by students. Even before we talked
					about the study, many asked, "Is it compulsory?", and some
					lost interest when told it was voluntary. The value of
					`voluntarism' was obviously in conflict with the culture of
					authoritarianism in our educational institutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently someone asked me how consent was obtained
					from students under the age of 18. I had not thought about
					it in such strict legal terms. All were treated equally except
					that younger (high school) students were given a more
					detailed explanation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Should we have intervened?</h4>
				<p>
					There were two instances when girl respondents refused to
					answer questions of sexual experience in a manner which
					suggested that they had traumatic experiences. The
					interviewer respected their 'choice' and merely recorded her
					observations. Later we wondered whether we should have
					probed further and at least offered to help them. As a
					researcher I felt that we should have made efforts to collect
					more sensitive information. Perhaps neither an institutional
					setting like a college nor a family setting is a suitable location
					for such data gathering.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Looking back, I feel that important ethical and
					methodological issues are meshed together especially in
					areas such as sexuality research. Attempts to protect
					individual rights may compromise the quality of information,
					and vice versa. How do we deal with such issues? They
					cannot be dealt with separately, but should become part of
					methodological training and debates in social sciences.
