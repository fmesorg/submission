			<h3>Teaching ethics and trading organs</h3>
			<h4 class="author">Sadath A Sayeed</h4>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					The buying and selling of human organs bothers many people
					these days, and for good reasons. As an academic teacher in
					the US who tries to help students test their moral intuitions in
					bioethics, I resist reflexive claims that the creation of a market
					for organs is simply wrong. To serve my students best, I feel
					obligated to push back-to figure out more precisely what
					bothers them so much. As a thought experiment, I like to
					borrow an apt question often posed by a colleague of mine:
					What's wrong with me (a physician, lawyer, and ethicist all rolled
					up into one with no outstanding debt or desperate need for
					money) accepting 5 million US dollars for one of my kidneys?
					If one accepts that society is made up of individuals with a
					plurality of acceptable values, and one takes seriously the notion
					that we ought to respect informed choices when it doesn't
					obviously harm others, it becomes trickier to find moral fault in
					this voluntary transaction. For one thing, it seems implausible
					to suggest that I am being unfairly treated in agreeing to such
					an arrangement. Moreover, being of sound mind, am I not
					allowed to do with my body as I please? Indeed, to further my
					case, I admit to having an overwhelming desire to retire early,
					buy a yacht and sail around the world, and the thought of
					eventually doing that in 20 years given my current comfortable
					salary depresses me. The sale of my kidney now will free me up
					immediately to do as I really please. Finally, to satisfy those close
					to me who worry about my welfare, I am making provisions with
					an insurance company with a small fraction of my substantial
					profit to cover all costs of follow-up care, including the unlikely
					possible need for dialysis and/or transplant should my one
					remaining healthy kidney fail in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					At least in the autonomy-loving US, when students are posed
					with this specific hypothetical, they struggle to find defensible
					reasons to prevent the sale of this dispensable body part. I take
					this struggling to be a sign of pedagogical success. However
					unrealistic or improbable the scenario seems, pressing this
					kind of "philosophical exercise" has educational value, and I
					would argue that students of medical ethics in India stand to
					benefit from engaging in such provocative reflection as much
					as students in my classroom. In this short commentary, I have a
					single point worth stressing: for all teachers of medical ethics, our
					job is to help students better identify what should count as core
					moral worries and what should count as mere window dressing
					in the ethical evaluation of health care practices, well-established
					professional behaviours, and social norms in our world.
				</p>
				<p>
					In no way should this be read as apologetic to the organ trade
					currently in existence in various parts of the world. India, in
					particular, has a grave problem with the illegal trafficking of kidneys. The problem is complex, and at least from my
					vantage, it raises unsettling questions about long-standing
					repressive social attitudes, and perhaps even professional
					medical conditioning, which insidiously appear to encourage a
					pattern of moral indifference to the country's most vulnerable
					populations <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goyal M, Mehta RL, Schneiderman LJ, Sehgal AR. Economic and health consequences of selling a kidney in India. JAMA 2002 Oct 2; 288 (13):1589-93." id="1">(1)</a>. Though tempting, no one person should be
					made a scapegoat as the chief source of organ mischief in India.
					As much as individual bad actors contribute to the perpetuation
					of the outlawed trade, it would be an incomplete indictment
					if the disregard for and often gross neglect by society's wellheeled
					for their worse off countrymen and women were not
					included in a full critique. The illicit market for organs can
					only function when many distinct human inputs are willingly
					(whether actively or passively) present, with simultaneous and
					often glaring inattention from sectors traditionally charged
					with protecting public welfare. Laws are only as effective as the
					people who administer them, and in an arena like medicine,
					successful enforcement also critically depends on responsible
					citizenship by professionals in health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Close examination of more transparent commercialised organ
					trades as organised in countries like Iran, and until recently
					Pakistan and the Philippines, also raises ethical worry <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shimazono Y. The state of the international organ trade: a provisional picture based on integration of available information. Bull of WHO 2007" id="2">(2)</a>.
					Those who have openly traded their kidneys for money in
					these countries can rarely, if ever, be characterised as wellpositioned
					to make an informed and truly voluntary choice. The
					libertarian assertion that these persons never have to agree to
					the proffered contractual terms wrongly seeks to prioritizes
					questionable expressions of "free will" , and overemphasize
					the moral import of "choice". It further risks discounting a
					tragic complex of psychological motivations stemming from
					oppressive background conditions that often culminate to
					severely restrict freedom. The available evidence reveals a
					clear lack of level playing field for actors in these commercial
					transactions <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shimazono Y. The state of the international organ trade: a provisional picture based on integration of available information. Bull of WHO 2007" id="2">(2)</a>. Indeed, with a wink and a nod, it seems
					participants in the open trade know that if the organ seller
					could financially afford not to give up her kidney, she would
					never agree to the transaction. The grim empirical truth is: the
					rich and well off are never the suppliers of sold kidneys, and
					almost always the recipients. As such, we are forced to own up
					to a core ethical problem with the actual creation of a regulated
					market for organs-in the real world, it seems predestined to
					promote exploitation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several potentially important questions follow: First, what
					defines exploitation? Second, what's wrong with exploitation?
					Third, even if we agree exploitation is wrong, can someone
					choose to be exploited when she deems it in her interests?
				</p>
				<p>
					Fourth, in cases where we are uncertain of the degree of
					exploitation, isn't the temptation to act paternalistically
					to restrict human liberty more worrisome? Each of these
					questions requires our thoughtful engagement. Additionally,
					focusing in on what makes the current exchange of organs for
					money exploitative is an exemplary means to begin an analysis
					of a much larger set of issues: the social determinants of health,
					personal responsibility for health, and the limited resources
					to secure health available at any time. It challenges teachers,
					students, and medical professionals to own up to society's
					shortcomings in promoting the welfare of the disenfranchised.
					It challenges us to examine a pervasive callousness towards
					those who by no fault of their own end up being born into
					destitution and squalour, who despite constant effort are many
					times unable to rise above their meagre circumstances and
					who, ultimately, find no avenue for relief but to sell their body
					parts to those of us who often are just born luckier.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, it should challenge those who would prefer to
					draw our emotional attention to the plight of those suffering
					in need of a kidney instead to a careful consideration of what
					would constitute the most responsible, rather than expedient
					and profitable, solution. It should force us to recognise that just
					because someone is willing to sell his kidney doesn't mean we
					ought to take it-much in the same way we don't reflexively
					honour a request for amputation, just because someone prefers
					to be one-armed. The presence of a quick medical fix doesn't
					mean it is the ethically preferable fix.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we are right to seriously worry about exploitation, surely we
					should dedicate our efforts to looking at alternative schemes to
					increase the pool of available organs before promoting the trade
					as it now operates (as example, consider a sizeable tax-benefit
					to the rich who &quot;donate&quot; kidneys). Finally, it is worth noting that
					those who advocate on behalf of the dying with transplantable
					organ failure in places like India (and who, by the way, profit
					handsomely from their surgical work) conveniently seem to
					forget that such innocent victims are hardly the majority of
					innocent victims who die daily from preventable disease with
					more easily treatable conditions (read: HIV/AIDS, TB). In the
					end, focusing on exploitation can lead all of us who have a
					stake in these issues to more seriously consider what it means
					to allocate scarce health resources (whether money, devices,
					drugs, or organs) sensibly and justly, and hopefully, will force
					more transparent conversations about prioritisation and greater
					acknowledgment of the need to ration medicine equitably
					rather than on mere ability to pay or &quot;willingness&quot; to supply.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that in order to get at any of these issues in a
					meaningful and constructive manner, we need to allow for
					provocative ethics discussions in relevant forums, not the least
					of which is in the pre-clinical classrooms of medical students
					globally. Strikingly, at the National Bioethics Conference in
					Bangalore in 2007, several prominent local ethics educators
					argued that we have no right to do with our organs as we
					please because they are (as we are) gifts from a divine source.
					Simply put, the sale of our body parts would violate a religious
					proscription. This position, of course, requires one to possess certain beliefs and commitments that are by definition not
					universally held, and therefore, begs a question about these
					educators' willingness to tolerate a plurality of human values.
					The more immediately worrisome feature of this kind of
					argument to me, however, is that, as potential pedagogy (these
					were medical school teachers), such talk stifles productive
					debate through demanding some kind of monolithic
					acceptance. Arguably, the better path to a more complete
					understanding of our uniquely human predicaments proceeds
					through a rigorous dialectic that doesn't presuppose right or
					wrong answers, and instead, openly evaluates the plausibility
					of possible justifications (whether rooted in deontological,
					consequentialist, secular, or religious traditions).
				</p>
				<p>
					Admittedly, this is not easy work for highly-trained
					philosophers, let alone basic medical ethics educators,
					particularly in academic environments where science is
					stressed over humanities. It requires a temperament of mind
					that is not instinctive to most medical professionals, and
					moreover, promoting this kind of analytic reasoning skill
					may seem unnecessarily indulgent in places overwhelmed
					by dramatic social inequities. However, I believe that while
					teaching medical ethics requires attention to context, it
					need not be exclusively preoccupied to local conditions. If
					human exploitation counts as a core moral worry, it should be
					universally felt. Many of us in the US are deeply troubled when
					legislators within our states suggest that prisoners (most often
					black males) should be offered reduced sentences in exchange
					for their kidneys to help with the supply side of the equation
					<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Adcox S. South Carolina looks at giving inmates reduced sentences for organ donations. South Florida Sun Sentinel 2007 Mar 9." id="3">(3)</a>. Many of us are also worried about the seemingly growing
					comfort many infertile women have here with purchasing a
					surrogacy contract at a much reduced price from &quot;willing&quot; fertile
					women in India <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gentleman, A. Foreign couples turn to India for surrogate mothers. International Herald Tribune 2008 Mar 4." id="4">(4)</a>. But, then how do we respond to published
					statements from some of these surrogates claiming that they
					are happy to take on these burdens and insist that they are
					not being exploited - which stands in notable distinction to
					the claims of their kidney vendor counterparts? Interestingly,
					some in India (who ostensibly oppose kidney trade) seem to be
					encouraging surrogacy as a legitimate part of the outsourcing
					growth industry, perhaps as another means to increase
					individual and the country's wealth. We need to ask ourselves:
					if the ultimate risks to the vendors of temporary womb rental
					and kidneys are plausibly comparable, can these contradictory
					positions be reconciled?
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, quick conclusions about the inherent wrongness
					of body part commodification need closer scrutiny. If we can
					remove exploitation from the realm of pragmatic worry, ethical
					objection to organ trading becomes harder to ground. As
					thoughtful medical ethics educators, getting our students to
					recognise a serious concern about social inequity is not all that
					we should feel obligated to do. If the slow growing but laudable
					commitment to bioethics education in India effectively
					translates into students being prevented an opportunity to
					examine all aspects of a moral problem in medicine either
					because their teachers insist only on preoccupation with
					the local injustices that undeniably colour the contextual
					application of moral principles, or because they demand that certain faith-based moral tenets never be violated, it is an
					approach that will do disservice to its intended audience. It
					certainly risks replacing a new opportunity for critical reflection
					with question-begging commandments. Pushing students,
					even in their late adolescence, to begin to think outside the
					box, to develop the capacity for philosophical inquiry, may be
					out of step with much mainstream science and mathematical
					educational practice in India <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fackler M. Losing an edge, Japanese envy India's schools. The New York Times 2008 Jan 2." id="5">(5)</a>. In my opinion, however, all
					persons who are worthy of the moniker &quot;teacher&quot; should aspire
					to at least one common thing: opening their students' minds
					rather than closing them.
