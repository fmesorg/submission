				<h4>Sensitive  article</h4>
				<p>
					This is with reference to your article on PVS <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nair K Rajashekharan. Clinical tales in neurology: a vegetative existence. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 55-57." id="1">(1)</a>.  I was touched by the entire story, but what touched me most is your reference to  nurses who care for such patients. Being a nurse myself, I appreciate the fact  that you have given thought to the caring aspects of PVS. I have often wondered  why many medical professionals admit terminally-ill patients with problems such  as multiple secondaries in the brain, or PVS, into intensive care units and  drain nurses' emotional strength. Having worked for over five years in intensive  care units, my colleagues and I have died many times over with every patient  (especially after caring for them for five days or more). A student of mine who  worked as a staff nurse once described to me her suffering when a patient who  was intubated for over seven days died in the ICU. She was quite sure that the  patient wanted to say something and was trying to communicate, but he died  without being able to do so. The death of that patient, without a loved one near  him, without being able to talk to anyone, killed a little of bit of the nurse  in her.
