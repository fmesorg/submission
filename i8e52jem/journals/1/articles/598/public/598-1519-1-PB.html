			<h3>On the other side of the waiting room</h3>

					The writer has painted a worst-case   scenario <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mamdani M. Waiting for the doctor... Indian J Med Ethics 2007; 4: 126-7." id="1">(1)</a> based on her visits and observations. On the other hand, I   have observed the practices of doctors who are members of a local family   physicians&rsquo; association, who have, over the years, tried to provide the   best to their patients. What I am going to write is therefore the   best-case scenario. The truth perhaps lies somewhere in between.</p>
				<p>
					In the West the number of chronic cases is larger and the number of   acute cases is fewer, and the doctor there has to see fewer patients. In   India, the numbers are large and acute cases constitute a greater   percentage of patients. Any appointment system in such a scenario will   not work.</p>
				<p>
					The time allotted to a patient in some of the good clinical   practices that I know of is, on average, 10 minutes in an 8-10 hour   working day. The average waiting time in most practices is about an   hour, and even in these clinics a very ill patient will be seen out of   turn. In some practices, such as mine, the waiting time is minimal   because the number of patients I see is small. I have not seen any   patient with &ldquo;worry writ large&rdquo; on their faces, as the writer has   described. The patients are sick and so, of course, they will not be in   the best of spirits. Any worry they may feel is because of the sickness   and not because of the prospect of confronting the doctor, who they   usually know well.</p>
				<p>
					Contrast this with what I know of practices in the West. It is   almost impossible to get access to any doctor in a hurry. Even acute   cases cannot get an appointment during the scheduled hours and have to   seek help in the emergency room, where the patient is likely to be seen   by a doctor who does not know her/ him. Unnecessary investigations and   procedures become a distinct possibility in such cases. Avoidable   interventions are not uncommon. For example, one of my patients has a   lipoma, which I had told her does not need surgery. Her US-based doctor   strongly advised her to get it removed. She was so scared that she   called to ask me what she should do. Such phone and e-mail consultations   are also not uncommon in India.</p>
				<p>
					A waiting room gets crowded because of the sheer numbers and the   expense involved in having larger clinics. Most patients cannot afford   to pay the fee we think we deserve, and a sizeable percentage of the   patients are treated free of cost. Many doctors I know have made changes   in their practice and, to some extent, have resolved this problem by   doing things like running special clinics at designated times and   issuing tokens. I do agree that problems exist, not because of an   uncaring attitude but because of socio-economic considerations. Written   records are indeed possible and some of us do maintain meticulous   records despite the time constraints. There is no fear of the taxman   because he knows that a general practitioner&rsquo;s income is not worth   bothering about.</p>
				<p>
					While it is inexcusable for a psychiatrist to spend ten minutes with   a patient, I think the writer should spend some time in one of our   clinics and see the levels of psychological comfort among the waiting   patients. I agree that a pleasant and spacious waiting area is required   and some of us have provided this, though it may be below the western   standard. This does not make our patients less happy than their western   counterparts. It is uncharitable to generalise that we don&rsquo;t treat our   patients with courtesy and consideration. There may be exceptions, but   then, that would be true also for the West.</p>
				<p>
					We do have special clinics at fixed times to see chronic cases, for   follow-up visits, and for new cases. But these are never six months into   the future. The reasons are many. Even after having this system in   place for over 10 years I am not happy with it because many of the   appointments are not kept and I end up wasting valuable time. In a small   study, I found that appointments are usually not kept because of   unexpected situations, terrible traffic, because the patient feels well,   or because she/ he forgot about the appointment.</p>
				<p>
					I agree with the writer that preventive care is still not the norm   in India. Most patients reason that if they are well, they need not   spend money. Most of them pay out of their pocket and many with limited   incomes must find ways of limiting costs.</p>
				<p>
					Coming to the matter of status, yes, we have treated the doctors who   are patients out of turn and continue to do so. However, I always ask   for the permission of the waiting patients if I have to see another   patient out of turn for any reason.</p>
				<p>
					The relationship with our patients, built over many years, is not   disturbed if we take a holiday. We may be apprehensive when we get back,   but usually the patients do visit again. I know this from my own as   well as other doctors&rsquo; experiences.</p>
				<p>
					I agree that the &ldquo;executive&rdquo; check-up is a farce and tests are best   left to the physician, who will order them after a need-based analysis.   Costs of care can never be standardised in the Indian context. In many   practices, fees are based on the patient&rsquo;s ability to pay, which can   often be difficult to determine. A consultant&rsquo;s charges are different   from a family physician&rsquo;s, though this is not always true.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is undoubtedly scope for improvement and many practices have   changed in ways that benefit both doctor and patient. The quality of   care in the practices that I know of is quite good considering the   constraints under which we work and live. Most of us are happy not   because we make large amounts of money but because of the immense   professional satisfaction we derive from our family medical practice.</p>
				<p>
					What, then, is the &ldquo;shabby&rdquo; treatment of our patients that the   writer is contrasting with the apparently &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; treatment that   patients get in the West?</p>
