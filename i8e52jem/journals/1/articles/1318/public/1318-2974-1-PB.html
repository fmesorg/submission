				<h4>Designer baby</h4>
				<p> A US couple used in vitro  fertilisation and preimplantation genetics to produce embryos and screen  them for a child who could be a stem cell and bone marrow donor for their daughter  &mdash; the first known instance where the techniques were used both to screen for a  disease and to ensure a tissue donor match in a sibling.</p>
				<p> The  couple's daughter, Molly, was born with Fanconi's anaemia, a rare, autosomal  recessive disease characterised by aplastic anaemia, brittle chromosomes, and  the variable presence of skeletal, cardiac and renal anomalies. Untreated,  patients do not survive to adulthood. Definitive treatment of the disorder  relies on reconstituting the patient's bone marrow via bone marrow  transplantation or umbilical stem cell transplantation.</p>
				<p> The  parents initially hesitated to have more children as they both carried the gene  for Fanconi's anaemia and had a 25 per cent chance of conceiving another  affected child by conventional means.</p>
				<p> They  underwent several cycles of IVF and the resultant embryos were tested both for  the presence of Fanconi's anaemia and for HLA matching. Only two of 15 embryos  were perfect tissue matches <strong>and</strong> free of the disease, and were implanted.  One survived the implant procedure. The resultant child was born on August 29,  and his umbilical stem cells were transplanted into his sister. If the  procedure is successful, Molly will have an 85 per cent chance of  recovery.</p>
				<p> Dr  Jeffrey Kahn, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Bioethics,  said: "We've crossed a line here, from protecting the health of a child to  selecting for donor traits."</p>
				<p> Ruth  Macklin of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, disagrees: "Some  would argue that this is having a child as a means to an end . . . but I think  that's not a good argument. People have children for lots of reasons and  sometimes for no reason at all."

				<h4>India and genome research</h4>
				<p> The Indian  health ministry's decision to pledge &pound;13.3m ($20m) for medical genomics  research over the next five years has provoked controversy, coming  simultaneously with budget cuts for malaria and leprosy control programmes.
			  </p>
				<p> The  Indian Council of Medical Research has already approved 20 research projects  and is evaluating at least 90 others in an attempt to fund broad areas in  medical genomics.</p>
				<p> "A major  goal of the programme will also be to prepare the country's medical community  for the era of molecular medicine," said Dr Vasantha Muthuswamy, head of  biomedical sciences at the council, told the <em>BMJ</em> . Projects include  genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases, the genetics of oral cancer and  cancer of the cervix, and the search for new drugs against malaria and  tuberculosis.</p>
				<p> Leading  biologists and policymakers express concern that although India is still  grappling with traditional health problems, it may be rushing into medical  genomics without a clear focus.</p>

				<h4>Opthalmologist faces criminal  case</h4>
				<p> Apaediatrician  who lost his eyesight following cataract surgery at Lilavati hospital in  Mumbai has filed a criminal case urging a police investigation after attempts  to seek justice in the consumer court came to nought.</p>
				<p> Dr Vijay  Kumar Pradhan and three other patients were operated for cataract on March 10  last year. All four had lost vision in the eyes on which surgery was performed,  due to infection. Though the patients maintain that the source of infection was  the operation theatre, the institution refuses to accept responsibility.</p>
				<p> In his  writ petition Dr Pradhan states that the surgery had been performed by Dr Nitin  Dedhia, consultant opthalmologist, who claimed the operation was successful.  The same day, the surgeon also operated on Jayaram Hegde, Manohar Parekh and A  Bhatia in the same operation theatre.</p>
				<p> After the  bandages were removed from Dr Pradhan's eyes the next day, there was no vision  and instead pus had formed, the petition states. A culture taken from the eye  showed the presence of E Coli bacteria, a gram negative bacterium of faecal  origin. Dr Pradhan was finally discharged from the hospital on March 22 without  any improvement. Despite another operation and several consultations, his  eyesight has not been restored. The petition claims that the bacteria must have  entered the operation theatre either from inadequately sterilised instruments  or linen, or through the staff's or surgeon's hands.</p>
				<p> When  asked, Dr Bhimani said their internal inquiries showed that there was no  infection in the OT and the source must have been from outside. However the  mater has been referred to the legal department of the hospital, which will be  dealing with the court case.</p>

				<h4>Holland and euthansia</h4>
				<p> The  Netherlands became the first country in the world to pass a law  decriminalising voluntary euthanasia. Dutch doctors carrying out the practice  under strict conditions will no longer be judged automatically as criminals  when the law comes into force this autumn.</p>
				<p> The  legislation will empower the regional committees of doctors, lawyers, and  ethicists, to whom doctors must report euthanasia cases, to decide whether a  doctor has acted with due care and if so to close the case. Currently that  power rests with the public prosecution service: the committees can only make  recommendations to the service.</p>
				<p> An  estimated 3,600 cases of voluntary euthanasia are carried out each year in the  Netherlands.</p>
				<p> Since  members of parliament passed the bill last November senators have been inundated  by mail on the topic from the public, but the balance of opinion has been in  favour of the bill.</p>
				<p> Opposition  spokesperson Yvonne Timmerman called for doctors to be given specific legal  rights not to cooperate with euthanasia on moral grounds. Health minister Els  Borst said professional standards already enabled staff with moral objections  to refuse to participate in euthanasia, abortions or in vitro fertilisation,  and believes the law will not result in an increase in the annual number of  voluntary euthanasia cases.</p>
				<p> The new  legislation states that doctors must be 'convinced' that the patient's request  is voluntary and well considered and that the patient is facing 'unremitting  and unbearable' suffering. Doctors must also have advised patients of their  situation and prospects and reached a firm conclusion with the patient that  there is 'no reasonable alternative solution'. Additionally, the doctor must  consult 'at least one other independent physician'. The law also offers legal  recognition of written euthanasia declarations and allows minors aged 12 to 16  to request euthanasia with the consent of their parents.</p>

				<h4>Hungary and pharmaceutical
			    ads</h4>
				<p> A new Hungarian  government decree will drastically limit pharmaceutical marketing, in order to bring down the
				country's drug costs.</p>
				<p>The decree will strictly limit the amount
				  manufacturers spend on conferences and
				  other events and will prohibit them from
			    paying for doctors' trips to these events.</p>
				<p>Drug companies gifts cannot exceed one per cent of Hungary's monthly minimum wage, currently 40000 forints (&pound;93). The decree
also limits the number of free pharmaceutical
samples doctors may accept and prevents
doctors from receiving drug samples directly
from manufacturers or importers. Such
"freebies" will instead come through the
chief pharmacist's office.</p>
<p>Representatives of drug companies &mdash;
usually doctors making much more than their
practising colleagues &mdash; will be prohibited
from pushing their products on fellow
doctors during office hours.</p>
<p>Drug companies say drug advertising in
Hungary is already regulated by advertising
and pharmaceutical laws, and the industry
code of ethics. Advertising agencies are
appalled, contending that the decree is an
unlikely remedy for Hungary's ailing
healthcare system. A spokesman for one
agency called the measures "nonsense" and
said the decree would "only give way to
more corruption."</p>

				<h4>Corporate hospital rivalry?</h4>
				<p> Bombay's  Jaslok Hospital recently issued a directive to its consultants to stay  away from 'large hospitals', a move hospital authorities say is only to ensure  that consultants give enough time to their patients.</p>
				<p> Jaslok's  consultants may have only two additional attachments, one a teaching attachment  and the other an attachment 'which is not with a large hospital'. The official  reason for the policy is that multiple attachments affect patient care. "If a  doctor has too many attachments, he or she doesn't spend enough time with  patients. One ends up spending time just on commuting from one hospital to  another and it is very unfair to patients," says a consultant with Jaslok.</p>
				<p> While no  one disputes this fact, many doctors also feel that increasing corporate  rivalry has a role to play in the formulation of the not-too-many attachments  policy. Similar policies exist for almost all the other large hospitals in the  city.</p>
				<p> Money is  the bottom line. "If you lose even one heart surgery to another hospital it  could mean a loss of anything above Rs 2 lakh," says one consultant. Besides,  many hospitals put pressure on consultants to bring business, says another  consultant. A doctor attached to two hospitals might take a patient to the  hospital where s/he can charge higher fees.</p>

				<h4>Missing: the human touch</h4>
				<p> High-tech  gizmos. State-of-the-art operation theatres. The best doctors and the best  addresses. Yes, the city's five-star  hospitals  do seem to have it all. Except that vital factor - human touch - or so say  patients.</p>
				<p> "My  doctors did not even ask me how I was doing after the surgery," recalls K Khan,  who recently underwent a hernia operation at a prestigious south Mumbai  hospital. Unable to control his nervousness, Mr Khan himself broached the  question. But the doctor's curt reply - "you are not a medical person to  understand that" - was the most bitter pill he had to swallow during his stay.</p>
				<p> Patients  are reportedly deprived of basic rights like their right to know why a  particular treatment is being given to them or why they need to go through a  battery of tests. "It is the doctor's duty to explain everything to the  patient, including the side-effects of medicines. But they just don't seem to  have the time," says Asha Inani, chairperson of the Consumer Guidance Society  of India.</p>
				<p> One patient  recollects how she was told to vacate the room as soon as her mother (the  patient) was shifted to the ICU. "My mother was sinking and I didn't know  whether to collect our belongings from the room or accompany her to the ICU,"  she recollects. She later found out that no one had occupied that room for the  next two days.</p>
				<p> Furthermore,  patients have in some cases had to spend money without reason. Hema Kartik, for  instance, had to settle for the most expensive room as the cheaper ones were  not available. "We booked the room in advance but were later told the cheaper  ones were being occupied by emergency case," she says.</p>
				<p> "Cheaper  rooms are invariably not available," says Ms Inani. The entire cost of the  patient's stay multiplies according to the type of room he or she is staying  in. "Besides, even if the patient is given two capsules, he or she will be  charged for the whole packet."</p>
				<p> Dr K G  Nair, medical director of Breach Candy Hospital, describes these as stray  incidents. "It is like going to an excellent restaurant where the food you get  is good 80 out of 100 times." He says that hospitals thrive on 'customer  delight' and cites that as one big reason why generations have patronised their  hospital.</p>

				<h4>Travelling for transplants</h4>
				<p> Canadian  patients desperately seeking kidney transplants are travelling to India,  China and the Philippines to get new organs, even though it is an offence in  their country. Canadians pay between $50,000 and $145,000 for a kidney  transplant.</p>
				<p> According  to the Canadian Organ Replacement Register, 536 Canadians died between 1997 and  1999 waiting for organ transplants.</p>
				<p> Dr  Jeffrey Zeltzman, a Toronto-based kidney specialist and director of St  Michael's hospital's renal transplant programme, is quoted as saying, "(It is)  like a black market underground economy. We've had lots of patients who have  gone. Some tell us and some don't tell us &mdash; they just come back with kidneys."</p>
				<p> Dr  Zeltzman also has horror stories to tell. He examined a patient who had  returned from India a six-inch scar on his abdomen after a kidney transplant.  An ultrasound revealed no transplant had taken place.</p>
				<p> A  Canadian businessman in partnership with a man in Shanghai allegedly charges  $5,000 for registering the names of people looking for transplants. These  people are then shipped to Shanghai where they get organs from Chinese persons  who have been involved in accidents. To them, China is the source for the  'largest supply of organs that are available'.</p>
				<p> Buying  and selling organs is illegal in all provinces and territories in Canada, but  it is only a breach of provincial regulations, not a criminal offence, and is  subject to a maximum fine of Canadian $1,000 and six months in jail.</p>

				<h4>Australian disabled are  sterilised</h4>
				<p> Areport  from the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reveals  that many disabled girls are being illegally sterilised, some without their  knowledge.</p>
				<p> Parents  usually make applications for sterilisation to the Family Court or Guardianship  Tribunal. About 45 per cent of the girls are 14 years old or younger and 13 per  cent have not begun menstruating at the time of the application. Also, more  than half have some form of physical and/or sensory impairment.</p>
				<p> According  to the report's author, Susan Brady, "It is impossible to say how many  sterilisations are being performed because they are being done illegally and  the data is unreliable. Since the mid-1980s, adults with decision-making  disabilities have not been allowed to have sterilisations without the consent  of a specialist and community-based guardianship tribunal. The same, however,  cannot be said of children."</p>
				<p> While the  states of New South Wales and South Australia have legislated to prohibit  sterilisation of children without the consent of a Guardianship Tribunal, there  are no such laws in the other states. This compels people to go to the Family  Court or Supreme Court for authorisation, which is expensive and traumatic for  families. As a result, many people are going outside the law and sterilising  children anyway. While there is not much data on the long-term health effects  of sterilisations performed on pre-pubescent girls, it is known that it can  cause an early onset of menopause, osteoporosis, heart disease and depression.</p>

				<h4>Ethics and orphans</h4>
				<p> In the  late 1930s, Dr Wendell Johnson, a professor at the University of Iowa,  USA, experimented with 22 children at a state-run orphanage to test his theory  that stutterers are not born but made &mdash; by putting psychological pressure on  children so they would stutter. Several children suffered lasting damage.</p>
				<p> Johnson  got a student to test the theory as her graduate thesis: 22 stutterers and  normal speakers were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group.  Children in the control group were labelled normal speakers and got  positive therapy. Children in the  experimental group were labelled stutterers and given negative therapy. The  labels were reinforced by the orphanage staff long after the experiment was  over.</p>
				<p> By the  end of the study, speech had deteriorated for five of six normal speakers and  three of five stutterers subjected to negative therapy. In the control group,  only one child suffered more speech interruptions at the end of the experiment.  The graduate student, Mary Tudor, returned to the orphanage two more times to  attempt reverse therapy &mdash; unsuccessfully.</p>
				<p> The news  of Nazi experiments created a predicament for Johnson. Publishing his theory  could help millions of children as well as elevate his status in the world of  speech pathology. But using the experiment as direct evidence could destroy his  career. So he forwarded his theory citing other, indirect evidence. By the late  1940s, his 'diagnosogenic theory' became the most widely accepted theory on the  cause of stuttering.</p>
				<p> A small  circle of speech pathologists have been aware of the 'Monster Study' for many  years and most agree that it provided direct evidence for Johnson's theory,  which changed the way people regarded stutterers and opened the door to  effective therapies.</p>
				<p> Twenty of  the 22 orphans have been traced, of whom at least 13 are still alive. They had  never heard about the experiment.</p>
				<p> This was  just one of many studies conducted by the university on orphanage children;  another was a decades-long study to see if developmental retardation was more  common among children in the overcrowded and unstimulating orphanage than among  children placed in a special new preschool.</p>

				<h4>Consumer fora and medical  negligence</h4>
				<p> President  of the Maharashtra state consumer redressal forum, MS Rane, assured  medical professionals that cases of medical negligence that come up before the  forum are heard in detail and that all precautions are taken before the final  judgement is delivered.</p>
				<p> At a  symposium organised by the Association of Medical Consultants on 'the  functioning of consumer courts vis-&aacute;-vis the medical profession', Mr Rane  agreed with medical professionals that it can be difficult for the court to  decide on a case without medical knowledge but the court's intervention is  needed to pass a judgement.</p>
				<p> The  financial difficulties faced by Mr Rane when he took over as president of the  forum in February 2000 have been addressed, he said, and the forum's  proceedings have been systematised. Complaints with documents supporting the  case are sent to the other party for response. The complainant is given an  opportunity to answer, after which the forum delivers its judgement. If the arguments  on both sides are almost equally balanced, the forum tends to lean on the  consumer's side, Mr Rane admitted.</p>
				<p> He stated  that doctors are a "vulnerable lot because their patients have a lot of  expectations from them, and want every treatment to be successful. Even though  people do file complaints against doctors, this number is very small, and the  percentage of doctors being held guilty is almost negligible."</p>
				<p> Earlier,  Dr Lalit Kapoor, spokesperson of the AMC, described the Consumer Protection Act  as a progressive piece of legislation enacted to give consumers a fair deal. At  the same time there is need to exercise caution in its day-to-day proceedings.  Doctors work in difficult circumstances and there are factors which are beyond  their control, like ill-equipped ambulances, shortage of qualified paramedical  staff and poor blood bank facilities. These factors also need to be taken into  account when deciding cases of medical negligence. Also, errors of judgement  are sometimes termed as negligence.</p>
				<p> Rane also  assured medical professionals that no false complaints would be entertained at  the consumer courts. It would be a good idea to increase the penalty in such  cases from the present Rs 10,000.</p>
				<p> He also  admitted that there is sometimes a trial by the media even before the case is  decided, but there are no rules to curb this.</p>

				<h4>Injectable contraceptives</h4>
				<p> The health  ministry will introduce the injectable contraceptive Net N on a trial  basis in 12 medical college hospitals in the country.</p>
				<p> Health  minister C.P. Thakur allayed fears about the contraceptive's side-effects. The  Supreme Court had earlier stayed its introduction following a petition by a  Gujarat-based NGO. Later the petition was withdrawn and the ministry promised  the court that it would introduce the injectables gradually, restricting them  first to urban centres, especially to medical college hospitals where  facilities for monitoring and care are available.</p>
				<p> Thakur  said that both injections and oral pills are hormonal preparations; singling  out injectibles for criticism was unwarranted.</p>
