				<h4>Medical help for victims of  violence in Gujarat</h4>
				<p>
					I want to appeal to all of you to take up the issue  of denial / apathy by Gujarat state machinery to provide medical help / care to  riot victims. Thousands of Muslims are suffering as they are not provided with  any medical care by state nor can they approach private carers as they are  certain they will be turned away. They are extremely scared to approach public  health services as they fear they will be killed. Reports indicate that Hindu  doctors are 'warned' not to cater to Muslim patients. This is a gross violation  of human rights. Are there any international norms regarding victims of  communal violence that ensure right to health care? Gujarat is worse than that  as it is clearly a case of ethnic cleansing.

				<h4>Doctors advertising, and drug  companies' pressures</h4>
				<p>
					I enclose an advertisement which appeared in the  Thane Plus edition of <em>The Times of India,</em> August 19, 2001. It gives details of  a prominent psychiatrist's schedule, his services and hospital address where he  can be contacted. This is blatant advertising to procure more patients. This  colleague has gone overboard and crossed all lines of ethics. It is strange  that a reputed newspaper like the <em>TOI</em> should actually comply despite knowing  that advertisement is not allowed in the medical profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, medical  representatives have been watching me with the help of chemists to see whether  I was prescribing their drugs, and if not, which drugs were prescribed instead.  This is clearly encroaching on my liberty to prescribe the drugs of my choice.  They actually tell me the details of drugs I had prescribed and how their  product was not pushed despite their requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirdly, some doctors in Mumbra,  Kalwa and areas surrounding these suburbs display their signboards. These  boards are not close to their hospitals, but at strategic locations nearly five  km away from the hospital, giving details of doctors, their services and  directions on how to get there. A board for a Mumbra hospital was found outside  Panvel. At regular intervals the signboard is repeated, reminding the traveller  about the hospital. Is this ethical?
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope FMES will look into these issues  and let us have guidelines on what actions to take.

				<h4>Biodatas of writers in IME </h4>
				<p>
					I urge you to include the pertinent bio data of  authors who are published in <em>IME.</em> It is important to know the author's  background, training or experience before one can interpret her/his article or  opinion piece in the journal. Such information would allow the reader to put  the piece in perspective.

				<h4>Capitation fees</h4>
				<p>
					I disagree with the extract from S Devraj about  capitation fees for colleges. If an individual's caste can guarantee a seat in  the medical college or an engineering college, why not money? Men of truth  should also be men of conviction and not only politically correct.

				<h4>Respect doctors' ethical  obligations</h4>
				<p>
					Hospital director Thys van Mollendorf was fired  because he condoned the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis to rape  survivors in the public Rob Fereira hospital in Mpumalanga province, South  Africa.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that the actions of the Mpumalanga MEC for Health, Ms  Sibongile Manana, who used a government tribunal to terminate the services of  Dr Thys von Mollendorff, are ethically indefensible. We call on her to  reconsider her actions in the light of doctors' universally recognised ethical  obligations to their patients, and to reinstate Dr von Mollendorff. Political  interference in healthcare delivery was unambiguously denounced by the World  Medical Association at the 38th World Medical Assembly in October 1986, as  follows:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Physicians must have the professional freedom to care for their  patients without interference. The exercise of the physician's professional  judgement and discretion in making clinical and ethical decisions in the care  and treatment of patients must be preserved and protected.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Physicians  must have the professional independence to represent and defend the health  needs of patients against all who would deny or restrict needed care for those  who are sick or injured."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr von Mollendorff acted within the letter and  spirit of this declaration. To victimise him for having defended the highest  principles of his profession, and for standing up for his mostly vulnerable and  poor patients, is unjust in terms of all civilised and humane ethical  standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, we believe that the MEC's actions go against President  Thabo Mbeki's call for volunteerism, since the services rendered by GRIP were funded  by voluntary contributions from the greater Nelspruit community, and were part  of the victim empowerment programme, officially mandated in terms of health  policy.

				<h4>Errata</h4>
				<p>
					The page numbering of the January-March 2002 issue  was inadvertently carried forward from the previous volume's numbering.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  Financial Report printed on the back page, salary expenditure was reported as  Rs 7,500. The correct figure is Rs 27,500. Total expenditure was reported as Rs  1,91, 083. The correct figure is Rs 149,083.
