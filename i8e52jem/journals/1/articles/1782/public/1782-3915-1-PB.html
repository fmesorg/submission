				<h4>The Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Programme, Centre for Integrative and Development Studies. University of the Philippines, Diliman 1101 Quezon City, Philippines.</h4>

				<p>
					With the publication the inaugural issue of the <em>PST Quarterly</em>, a need for a forum discussing the psychosocial impact of violence on individuals and society in the Asia-Pacific region of the world, has been met.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inaugural issue of the <em>PST Quarterly</em> replaces the newsletter of the Secretariat and announces the shifting of the Secretariat office to the Phillipines.
				</p>
				<p>
					The phenomenal increase in violence all over the globe has resulted in a large number suffering from its impact. The editorial declares psychosocial trauma as an injury caused by an event, whether man-made or natural, which result in temporary or permanent mental, emotional, spiritual, or moral dysfunction or maladjustment and which impairs a person's capacity to resume a healthy and meaningful life.
				</p>
				<p>
					An increasing number of health workers are called upon to provide treatment to the sufferers of the psychosocial trauma. June Lopez, Angela Guilar et al. discuss findings from their survey of 383 physicians of the Philippine Medical Association on their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the sufferers of psychosocial trauma. They found that almost one fifth of doctors in the Philippines have treated a detainess, while 55% are aware of the occurrence of torture. Most of the doctors surveyed did not agree with the statement that torture is an extrmely rare practice in the Philippines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Caroliza Pateros asks, 'Did doctors take part in the torture of prisoners?' She suggests that the medical associations should issue guidelined specifying that doctors should not be involved in torture. She also informs us that most doctors in the Philippines cannot identify signs of torture, a not uncommon finding in India as well. There is also an essay on the Draft Platform of Action of the Beijing conference, analysing its position on the violation of human rights of women.
				</p>
				<p>
