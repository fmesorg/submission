				<h4>Prescription by remote control</h4>
				<p>
					I reproduce beiow two examples of medical advice prescribed by a surgeon through the columns of a newspaper without having obtained a detailed history, examined the patient and arrived at a scientific diagnosis. Both items are from the column entitled 'Bodywatch' by Dr. Vithal Kamat published in Navhind Times.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first extract is dated 19 April 1997:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Q.: I am a 11-year-old boy having some facial problems. They are:</p>
				<p>
					(1) My face is full of pimples and blackheads
				</p>
				<p>
					(2) There are very small black clots in my nose
				</p>
				<p>
					A.: Keep your face clean... Take cap. tetracycline 250 mg. twice daily for one month, then once a day for one more month. Take vitamin A and vitamin B complex for two months..."
				</p>
				<p>
					The second item is from the issue dated 17 May 1997:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Q.: I am a 28-year-old unmarried girl, Since some years ago, I used some external
				</p>
				<p>
					objects to arouse sexual pleasure. Now I have a foul-smelling discharge
				</p>
				<p>
					A.: . ..Take a course of antibiotics - tablets ciprolloxin, 500 mg. twice a day for 8 days..."
				</p>
				<p>
					Is this ethical'? If not, is there a remedy through the Medical Council of India?
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>A concerned surgeon, Panaji, Goa 403001</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					(We posed this question to a senior consultant experienced in writing for the media. This is his response:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"It is unscientific and unethical to treat patients through correspondence. Prescribing drugs, especially those with side effects - and there are precious few without these unwelcome attendant effects 'by long distance' is also hazardous and may land the patient into a sorry mess</em>."
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"The best that a medical columnist can do is to make general observations and guide the person requesting help to her family physician or a relevant specialist. When recommending a specialist it is important not to favour any specific individual. It is best to direct the patient to 'a reputed surgeon' or 'a reputed endocrinologist' rather than Dr. A.B.C. If a teaching hospital is available nearby - as it is in Panaji - the patient can be guided to the appropriate department there so that treatment is made available to her at minimal cost</em>."
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"As regards the Medical Council of India, Dr. Mani's experience, published earlier in your journal', does not permit optimism. Even so, there is nothing to be lost by 'A Concerned Surgeon' bringing this matter to their notice</em>." &ndash; Editor)
