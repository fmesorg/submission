              <h4>Euthanasia in  Australia <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kuhse Helga: Voluntary euthanasia, politics and the law. Monash Bioethics Review 1997; 16: 1-4." id="1">(1)</a></h4>
              <p>
                Kuhse's editorial reviews the legal aspects of euthanasia in  Australia. Kuhse's points out the deep divisions on this issue on moral and  philosophical grounds in Australian society. The Prime Minister, John Howard,  and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, were publicly seen to oppose the  practice.
                </p>
              <p>
                Kuhse narrates the case of Mr. Rod Dent to show how political  pressure can alter even a deeply felt, personal decision. Rod Dent had publicly  supported his father's decision to end his life. Later, there was a volte face.  Rod Dent told a journalist, in an interview recorded on tape, that he had come  under intense pressure from Kevin Andrews, the Finance Minister, and others and  felt it was in his own interest as a senior political strategist that he fall in  line.
                </p>
              <p>
                "In a liberal and democratic society, such as Australia,  voluntary euthanasia must, ultimately, be a matter of personal liberty,"  says Kuhse. She counters the common objection based on the slippery slope  hypothesis by pointing out that even under existing, prohibitive laws, doctors  are actively engaged in the practice of voluntary euthanasia and assisted  suicide well documented in large numbers of empirical surveys in Australia and  overseas. Doctors are intentionally ending the lives of patients, virtually  unregulated, either through the administration or prescription of drugs, or by  bringing about the desired result by some other means that disguised intent.  (This essay was written before the Australian Senate passed the anti-euthanasia bill. The section entitled News in brief - pages 5-8 - also  contains important information on this subject.)

              <h4>Xenotransplants in  Britain and the US <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: Xenotransplants - Britain and IJS. Monash Bioethics Review 1997; 16: 12-13." id="2">(2)</a></h4>
              <p>
                Acommittee advising the British government has recommended  that transplants of animal organs into humans should be prohibited until the  risks are better understood. The Department of Health's Advisory Group on the  Ethics of Xenotransplantation calls for new laws governing the field. The  report recommends setting up an independent committee to monitor the progress  of xenotransplantation and approve experiments. The recommendation has since  been accepted by the government. According to the Advisory Group, chaired by  Professor Ian Kennedy from King's College, London, xenotransplantation is still  too risky even to try experimentally. A few months earlier, new guidelines on  xenotransplantation had been released in the US. The guidelines, developed  jointly by the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of  Health and the Centers for Disease Control covers transplants of animal cells,  organs and tissues into human patients. American hospitals that transplant  organs from animals to humans might now need to add a battery of experts  (specialists in infectious diseases, a clinical microbiologist and a  veterinarian) to their research teams. They would also need to seek government  approval for each operation.

              <h4>Confidentiality <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pellegrino Edmund D: Secrets of the couch and grave: the Anne Sexton case. Monash Bioethics Review 1997; 16: 21-35" id="3">(3)</a></h4>
              <p>
                Edmund Pellegrino, Director, Georgetown Center for the Advanced Study of  Ethics, discusses in detail the issue of confidentiality, using the case of  Anne Sexton as an example. The poet Anne Sexton committed suicide. Three  hundred tapes of her sessions with her psychiatrist were released to Sexton's  biographer with the concurrence of Sexton's daughter and literary executor.  Publication of the book, containing accounts of Sexton's sexual aberrations,  alcohol and drug abuse and accounts of emotional turmoil, stirred up strong  criticism.
                </p>
              <p>
                Pellegrino points out that the moral right to the protection of  secrets is rooted in the trust essential to interpersonal relations. Without  this we would lose the benefits of intimacy, counselling and advice on matters  of personal interest and would be rendered vulnerable to harm from broadcast of  information. Violations of confidence are violations of our person as our  innermost thoughts, personal experiences, promises, foibles or vices arc parts  of our person.
                </p>
              <p>
                Disclosure of confidence may be voluntary or involuntary. When  voluntary, the patient releases the physician from secrecy by giving morally  valid consent, obtained after informing the patient of the uses to which the  confidential information is to be put. Involuntary disclosure trust always be  for the benefit of the patient (suicidal tendency) or prevention of harm to  others (homicidal tendency). On the issue of infection by HIV, Pellegrino  states, "There is no justification to conceal knowledge of the possibility  of exposure to a uniformly fatal disease like AIDS... if harm to an  identifiable other person is a possibility."
                </p>
              <p>
                On the release of Anne Sexton's tapes, Pellegrino argues that  this was unethical. To the argument that since Sexton is dead, release of the  tapes could not do any harm to her, he points to the real harm that can be done  to the memory of a dead person. He quotes Confucius: "If we treat the dead  as if they were wholly dead, it shows want of affection; if we treat them as  wholly alive, it shows want of sense."
                </p>
              <p>
                Fittingly, he quotes Anne Sexton in (<em>Doctors</em>) to sensitise us to the complex nature of the  doctor-patient relationship:
                </p>
              <p>
                "The doctors should fear arrogance more
                <br />
                than cardiac arrest.
                <br />
                If they are too proud,
                <br />
                and some are,
                <br />
                then they leave home on horseback.
                <br />
                But God returns them on foot."

                "Imagine being in surgery when the surgeon believes you are  fully anaesthetised. In reality, however, you are completely aware and alert.  Your mind is racing. You fear that since you can hear the surgeon's  conversation and fee his fingers on your body, no doubt you will feel the  incision as well. In addition, you feel you are suffocating because the  respirator does not let you breathe as much as air as you want... You then hear  the surgeon ask for the scalpel. You try to beg and scream for him to stop but  no sound comes out of your mouth. The surgeon finally makes the incision and  you feel like you are going to explode. The pain is inconceivable. You want to  die rather than continue with the operation. You feel violated and  deceived..."

              <p>
                The country's biggest fraud in medical admissions came to light  at the Maharani Laxmibai Medical College and Hospital, Jhansi. The present  principal, Professor V. K. Kulshreshtha, on instructions from higher authorities,  ordered the cancellation of admissions of forty-four students who had gained  entry to the course leading to MBBS in August 1995 using fraudulent means.  These students were admitted to the medical college when Professor V N. Prasad  was Principal and Dean. The ousted students were to appear for the first  professional examination conducted by the 97 Bundelkhand University, Jhansi.
                </p>
<p>Several lakhs of rupees had allegedly been collected from each  candidate before admission. The students were then provided fake letters and  University documents supposedly issued by the Director-General of Medical  Education and Training, Lucknow demonstrating success at entrance examinations.  Students also produced false mark sheets which showed much higher percentages  than those actually obtained. All these students belonged to rich families and  were from Lucknow or Kanpur.
              </p>
              <p>
                As soon as this news broke, these students disappeared from  their hostels and have, since, been absconding.

              <p>
                Jim Welsh, medical director of Amnesty International, spoke of  the barriers stopping health professionals from speaking out. He referred to  the culture of fear of the gun, economic pressures including the fear of  demotion or losing one's job and the manner in which the state can and does  ignore medical evidence. He also referred to the need for educating doctors on  the methods to be used when examining a victim of torture. He emphasised that  disobeying corrupt and evil governments requires solidarity within the health  care professions and support from other groups concerned about human rights.

              <p>
                The Case Commentary in the current issue of <em>Otago  Bioethics Report</em> is  thought provoking. A 56-year-old man with a solitary tumour nodule in the  centre of the right lung was scheduled for removal of that lung. "On the  day of the operation the surgeon arrived slightly late and somewhat flustered  from a difficult operation at another hospital. (The patient) was already  anaesthetised and positioned on the table, hidden under the drapes. The  operation was uneventful... The following morning, routine post-operative X-ray was taken... To her horror (the surgeon) realised that the one remaining  lung was the one with the tumour and that she had removed the wrong  lung..." The question posed was: What should the surgeon do?
                </p>
              <p>
                Both commentators (Nicola Peart, Senior Lecturer in Law and  Professor John Morton of the Christchurch School of Clinical Medicine),  emphasise that the surgeon must face up to her error. Dr. Morton also states  that she must, at once, ensure that the patient's further physical and mental  care receive very careful thought and attention. "sShe must inform (him)  what has happened and discuss with him (and his family) who will be responsible  for continuing care. Under the circumstances, the patient may want his care  taken over by another surgeon. She should make it clear to him and his family  that this can be arranged..."

              <p>
                Killing is an act which is normally repulsive to man. When self-preservation demands that we kill, killing acquires a not entirely negative  colour.
                </p>
              <p>
                In euthanasia we need to answer two questions. Who is the agent  for killing? Is euthanasia a killing or murder?
                </p>
              <p>
                Mitra points out that switching off a respirator once a  diagnosis of brain death has been made is not killing and is, thus, not  euthanasia either. A terminally ill individual in severe pain which, in the  opinion of doctors, will continue or even worsen till death, does not face a  good death but what of the aged person afflicted by a variety of illnesses who  refuses pills and potions and desires death? Physical pain apart, what if the  patient suffers inexorable mental pain? Is letting someone die equivalent to  killing him?
                </p>
              <p>
                The strongest argument in support of euthanasia is mercy. Mitra  suggests that if euthanasia be permitted in the case of physical pain, it must  be extended to those in inexorable mental pain as well. In summary, he advises  the clinician to place himself in the position of the patient before arriving  at a decision--almost always a certain guide to proper care.
                </p>
              <p>
                He also points to a danger: the request/consent of the patient  may amount to nothing more than a formal rubber stamp to clear the conscience  of the persons who will carry out euthanasia on the patient. There is a real  hazard when non-suffering persons around the suffering patient effectively  decide whether euthanasia is to be applied.

              <h4>Organs for  transplantation demand vs supply <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Barnett AH. Blair RD, Kaserman DL: A market for organs. Society September/October 1996 p 9-16." id="11">(11)</a></h4>
              <p>
                Public awareness of the critical shortage of cadaveric human  organs made available for transplantation in America was highlighted when  baseball star Mickey Mantle needed a liver. This case also brought into prominence  deficiencies in the system used to allocate these scarce organs. The authors  advocate the creation of 'organ markets' to set into motion a policy for the  distribution of organs based on the powerful incentives provided by free market  forces which will bring forth the additional supply of organs needed to met the  growing demand for them.
                </p>
              <p>
                They conclude that the cause of the shortage is the fact that  many more organs are buried (or cremated) than the number of patients needing  them. Add to this the sums needed to keep patients needing transplants alive  till organs are available and the case for greater use of cadaver organs  becomes compelling. The marginal improvement in results with living donors is  rapidly declining as new immunosuppressive drugs are discovered. The case for  subjecting a young, healthy individual to the risks of donating an organ such  as a kidney becomes less and less defensible.
                </p>
              <p>
                It is argued that the public policy that outlaws the sale of  cadaveric organs only worsens an already difficult situation. "The  artificial shortage created by the zero-price policy pushes the value of the  relatively few organs that are collected far above the market-clearing  level."
                </p>
              <p>
                Attempts to obtain organs have included suggestions that  preferences for donating organs for transplantations be sought when applying  for a driver's licence or submitting income-tax returns and these be recorded  in such a way that they are obvious to attendants in hospitals when the person  is admitted for medical care. Other attempts have included obtaining the  consent of every patient on admission to hospital for removal of organs for  transplantation in the unfortunate event of brain death being diagnosed.

                Yet another proposed means is conscription. Every patient being admitted  to hospital is informed that his organs will be removed for transplantation if  brain death supervenes. This is anathema to most.

              <p>
                There appears to be growing enthusiasm towards offering  compensation to donors and their families as an added inducement to donate  organs. Some have proposed paying the funeral expenses. Others propose waivers  of driving licence fees or income-tax rebates for those willing to sign binding  agreements for donation of organs after brain death.

              <p>
                A few -- such as the authors of this essay -- go a step further.  Why not organise organ markets? Under this system, agents of for-profit firms  offer a market-determined price for either ante-mortem or post-mortem  agreements for the firm to collect organs for resale to transplant centres.  Since tangible rewards are involved, it is envisaged that this system will  elicit a much more favourable response.

                The authors list arguments for and against organ markets.

              <h4>Scientific ethics in  India <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Valluri SR: Whither ethics in practice and management of science in India. Society for Scientific Values. News and Views 1997; 5: 2-6." id="12">(12)</a></h4>
              <p>
                Before independence, by and large, there was a scholarly  commitment to the cause of science by a few dedicated scientists. The result  was that India produced a Raman, a Saha, a Bose and a few other outstanding  scientists. After independence, the pursuit of science, in a very real sense,  became one more job opportunity. It was not the idealistic desire to advance  scientific knowledge that was the driving force, but solely the need to make a  living. The desire of the government to establish quickly an educational,  research and development base in the country, with faith in the ability of  scientists to improve the standards of living of our people opened the gates  for a rapid increase in investment by government in science.
                </p>
              <p>
                The interface between science and technology, which could have  attracted large direct investment in research and development, did not develop  to any significant extent in India. Thus, while the number of persons pursuing  a scientific profession continued to increase, real per capita investment  decreased. The result has been a struggle within the scientific community for a  share of government funds.
                </p>
              <p>
                The very nature of the scientific profession demands far higher  ethical standards for its healthy growth. We have to note with regret that scientists  arc no more virtuous that any other members of the community. The situation has  not improved by the extreme importance given to the number of publications  rather than their quality in deciding appointments and promotions. The driving  force in science at present is not the pursuit of knowledge but the urge to  survive. This has led to scientists compromising ethics in their professional  conduct.
                </p>
              <p>
                Integrity demands that a scientist is not honest only when  others are looking at him but, more importantly, that he is honest and ethical  when nobody is looking at him. The culture of the younger generation looking up  to their seniors as models to emulate imposes enormous responsibility on them.
                </p>
              <p>
                The responsibility for maintaining ethics lies on senior scientists  in academic institutions. The heads of these institutions, instead of becoming  protectors of scientific integrity, have become protectors of individuals who  compromised it. When senior scientists get to know that something is wrong and  do nothing about it, they provide a licence for others to emulate the  wrongdoers. And so the disease spreads with an increase in adding their names  to papers to which they have contributed nothing, plagiarism, falsification of  data, creation of fictitious data...
                </p>
              <p>
                If a Vice-Chancellor of a University lets off one of his faculty  members with a mild censure when he violates the very core of the ethics of  science in its practice by creating a false database, or the head of an  institute tries to project the image of rapid progress by including titles of  papers resulting from research work done elsewhere by calling their authors  'honorary faculty', or an editor of a science journal delays publication of an  issue so as to get one of his articles published in it, Indian science attracts  contempt.
                </p>
              <p>
                To argue that such rot exists in the developed world is not an  answer. Academic and research institutions there are active in curbing such  practices. In any case, their malpractices are their problems and certainly do  not constitute examples for us to follow.
