				<h4>The <em>IJME</em> National Bioethics Conference</h4>
				<p>
					The <em>IJME</em> National Bioethics Conferences are a meeting ground for delegates from India and abroad to report, debate and brainstorm on a wide range of ethical issues in health, healthcare and health research. Each NBC has witnessed the active participation of bioethicists from across the globe.
				</p>

				<h4>Sixth <em>IJME</em> National Bioethics Conference</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Healing and dying with dignity: Ethical issues in palliative care, end-of-life care and euthanasia</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Sixth NBC will be an opportunity to discuss three closely-related themes in healthcare ethics which deserve urgent attention, clarity and action to honour patients' right to healing and dying with dignity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two areas of concern to be covered in this conference are Palliative Care and End-of-Life Care. With the extremely inequitable distribution of facilities across the country, a large number of patients and their families are left in tremendous distress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much debate on euthanasia was sparked off by the 42-year-long persistent vegetative state of the nurse Aruna Shanbaug, after being brutally assaulted at her hospital. But this discussion needs to be taken forward. The conference will provide an opportunity to reflect on this and related issues with a view to achieving some recommendations for legal and health systems policy reform in the country.

						<strong>The Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES)</strong>. FMES was founded by a group of Mumbai-based medical practitioners in 1989, with the primary agenda to highlight issues in medical ethics and generate discussions around them. The organisation has played a critical role in developing, and supporting the growth of bioethics in India.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME)</em> <a href="http://ijme.in/index.php/ijme/" target="_blank">www.iime.in</a>.

It evolved out of a commitment to women's rights within and outside the home, working with a feminist perspective and a human rights approach. MASUM holds that people can resolve their own problems collectively with some amount of external support; thus, it focuses on strengthening people's perspectives on democracy, equality, secularism and social justice.
