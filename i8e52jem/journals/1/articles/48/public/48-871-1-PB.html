				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					<em>"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the  														health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,  														clothing, housing and medical care"</em> (Universal Declaration of  														Human Rights, 1948).
				</p>

				<p>
					Over the last decades, most countries have indeed acceded to  														at least one global or regional covenant confirming the right  														to health <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hogerzeil HV. Essential medicines and human rights: what can they learn from each other? Bull World Health Organ. 2006 May; 84(5):371-5." id="1">(1)</a>. The right to health should be achieved, among  														others, by making essential medicines of assured quality at an  														affordable price <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.

But in this respect, a significant gap exists  														today between the majority of high-income countries, where  														the state has sufficient resources to ensure access to quality  														medicines to people in its territory; and many low- and middle-income  														countries, where the state lacks the capacity to do  														so. Despite the availability of centres of excellence for several  														major diseases, and adequate treatment options, the lack of  														global equity in health and in access to healthcare and good  														quality medicines can be regarded as one of the chief human  														rights dilemmas in the 21st century <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Farmer P. The major infectious diseases in the world: to treat or not to treat? N Engl J Med. 2001;345(3):208-10." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, a global equity effort is needed to make quality  														medicines accessible to all, irrespective of the income of the  														countries and of the individuals, and as a part of the global  														effort to ensure the human right of access to health for  														everybody. The Indian pharmaceutical sector currently plays a  														pivotal and unique role in this effort: not only locally for Indians,  														but on a larger scale, thanks to its increasingly important role  														in supplying affordable generic medicines to the humanitarian  														and not-for-profit sector in the developing world <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gulland A.

				</p>
				<p>
					However, a report from the Indian Parliamentary Standing  														Committee on Health and Family Welfare has revealed, in 2012,  														some important shortcomings of the Indian Central Drugs  														Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), highlighting the  														vulnerability of quality standards of medicines <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare.

The fact  														that the findings from this report were brought to the attention  														of the international scientific community through an editorial  														opinion of <em>The Lancet</em> <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="No author listed. Drug regulation in India &ndash; the time is ripe for change. Lancet. 2012 May19;379(9829):1862" id="10">(10)</a>, further underscores the global  														importance of Indian medicines.
				</p>

				<h4>The Indian pharmaceutical industry and the global market</h4>
				<p>
					Pharmaceutical companies are profit-driven enterprises,  														whose primary objective is not global health. Indian  														pharmaceutical companies are no exception to this rule.  														However, while the western-based pharmaceutical companies  														have largely neglected populations and public health needs  														in low-income countries, Indian manufacturers have made  														major investments in the African market, as well as in the  														"humanitarian" market (major donors, United Nations agencies  														and big non-governmental organisations). And not without  														success: indeed, a significant proportion of the wealth of Indian  														millionaires originates from the pharmaceutical industry <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Karmali N. India's pharma kings are the country's big winners. Forbes Magazine online edition [Internet]. 2012 Oct 25[cited 2013 Apr 2]. Available from: http://www.forbes.com/sites/naazneenkarmali/2012/10/25/ indias-pharma-kings-are-the-countrys-big-winners/" id="11">(11)</a>.  														These investments were clearly encouraged by the unique  														Indian national intellectual property (IP) legislation, which  														incorporates essential provisions to protect public health for  														all in India, making the production of affordable generic drugs  														possible. The ethical controversy arising here, of IP protection  														versus assured access to essential medicines for the poorest  														quintiles of the population, was clearly addressed in favour  														of the right to health for all Indians. Indirectly, this resulted in  														substantial benefits for global health as well, especially in the  														field of HIV/AIDS, for which the availability of quality-assured  														Indian generics allowed an unprecedented scaling-up of access  														to the ARV treatment worldwide <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waning B, Diedrichsen E, Moon S. A lifeline to treatment: the role of Indian generic manufacturers in supplying antiretroviral medicines to developing countries. J Int AIDS Soc. 2010 Sep 14;13:35." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, the Indian Patent Office issued India's first-ever  														compulsory licence, which ended Bayer's monopoly in India on  														the anti-cancer drug sorafenib: an Indian generic producer was  														authorised to manufacture and sell the drug for 3% of Bayer's  														price in the country, while paying the company a royalty <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Arie S. Bayer challenges India's first compulsory licence for generic version of cancer drug BMJ. 2012 Sep 6;345:e6015." id="12">(12)</a>.  														This decision was taken in the interest of public health and  														it shows once more that affordable quality Indian generics  														have the potential to make treatment available to a larger  														proportion of patients, and in therapeutic fields other than HIV/  														AIDS. This could apply outside India as well, as indicated by the  														2012 dispute between an Indian generic manufacturer and  														Sanofi-Aventis in South Africa, concerning the anti-cancer drug  														docetaxel. The Treatment Action Campaign, an independent  														South African organisation that advocates for access to  														treatment for people living with HIV, intervened in the dispute  														to argue that the court's decision should be based on the public  														interest and the right of access to healthcare. Eventually, the  														Supreme Court ruled in favour of Sanofi-Aventis; however, after  														the Indian competitor's entry into the market, Sanofi-Aventis  														introduced its own cheap generic version of the drug <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="No author listed. TAC intervention leads to important legal advance: public interest concerns are relevant in determining interim interdict in patent cases. Treatment Action Campaign [Internet]. 2012 Jul 31[cited 2013 Apr 2]. Available from: http://www.tac.org.za/community/ node/3298" id="13">(13)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>Indeed, the Indian judiciary's position in recent judgments  														may be seen as favourable to public health on a global scale  														(not limited to HIV/AIDS) and it could act as a model for other  														countries.</p>
				<p>
					But important caveats remain. In particular, the recent reports  														concerning poor regulatory enforcement of medicine quality  														requirements seem to indicate an unexpected gap between  														the valuable effort to build on universal <em>access</em> to essential  														medicines and a parallel effort to guarantee universal <em>quality</em> of all essential medicines. Nevertheless, <em>access and quality</em> need to be achieved simultaneously, to fulfill the basic ethical  														requirement of equity and to provide adequate and safe  														treatment to all.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>The threats of a "variable" regulatory standard</h4>
				<p>
					A number of Indian drug manufacturers have demonstrated  														their ability to offer affordable essential medicines that comply  														with stringent quality standards. The WHO has prequalified  														several of their products and they have become major suppliers  														for the Global Fund, various UN organisations and several public  														and not-for-profit treatment programmes in low- and middleincome  														countries. WHO's prequalified medicinal products  														search reveals 304 drugs which list India as their manufacturing  														site and have been prequalified by WHO <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. WHO List of Prequalified Medicinal Products [Internet]. Undated [cited 2013 Apr 2]. Available from: http://apps.who. int/prequal/default.htm" id="14">(14)</a>. Meanwhile, many  														Indian manufacturers also tap into the richest global private  														markets, and partnerships between the largest Indian generics  														manufacturers and multinational pharmaceutical companies  														are becoming more and more frequent.
				</p>
				<p>
					But simultaneously, various studies have reported cases of  														medicines manufactured in India not complying with adequate  														quality standards, and the quality of some medicines from  														India has been questioned in larger studies <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sundar S, Sinha PR, Agrawal NK, Srivastava R, Rainey PM, Berman JD, Murray HW, Singh VP. A cluster of cases of severe cardiotoxicity among kala-azar patients treated with a high-osmolarity lot of sodium antimony gluconate. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1998 Jul;59(1):139-43." id="15">(15</a>, <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nayyar GM, Breman JG, Newton PN, Herrington J. Poor-quality antimalarial drugs in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Lancet Infect Dis. 2012 Jun;12(6):488-96." id="16">16)</a>. A survey  														published in 2009 reported that 7% of all drugs tested from  														pharmacies in two major Indian cities were of poor quality,  														with a striking 12% in India's capital city Delhi; figures could  														be higher in poorer and rural areas, where no equivalent  														survey was conducted <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bate R, Tren R, Mooney L, Hess K, Mitra B, Debroy B, Attaran A. Pilot study of essential drug quality in two major cities in India. PLoS One. 2009 Jun 23;4(6):e6003." id="17">(17)</a>. These reports are obviously  														not homogeneous. Some are from the specialised medical  														press and some from the lay press. Some are suggestive of  														counterfeiting, which, according to the WHO, implies deliberate  														misrepresentation of the identity of a pharmaceutical  														product and is always illegal; and some are suggestive of  														substandard pharmaceutical products, which do not comply  														with appropriate standards despite being approved by the  														competent authorities, and may be due to incidents on the  														production line or to systematic negligence regarding good  														manufacturing practices. However, irrespective of the nature of  														specific cases, these findings echo other reports at the national  														and international levels, and they are fuelling a more general  														perception of the Indian pharmaceutical industry as a source of  														bad medicines <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Swaminath G. Faking it. The menace of counterfeit drugs. Indian J Psychiatry. 2008 Oct-Dec; 50(4): 238-40." id="18">(18)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lack of strict regulatory supervision over the licensing,  														manufacturing and sale of medicines, acknowledged by  														the Parliamentary Report <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare. Fifty-ninth report of the functioning of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO). New Delhi; Rajya Sabha Secretariat; 2012 May." id="8">(8)</a>, seems to represent the most  														important factor that makes the Indian pharmaceutical sector  														permeable to poor-quality medicines. This situation is common  														to all those countries that cannot rely on a solid and rigourous  														regulatory system (according to the World Health Organization,  														this includes almost 80% of all its member states <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization Initiative (AMRHI): a WHO concept paper [Internet]. WHO Drug Information 2008 Aug [cited 2013 Mar 17];22 (3):182-190. Available from: http://www.essentialdrugs.org/edrug/archive/200812/ msg00030.php" id="19">(19)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, the contradictions of the Indian pharmaceutical scenario  														somehow mirror the contradictions of the international  														pharmaceutical market, which is characterised by a situation  														of multiple quality standards <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Caudron JM, Ford N, Henkens M, Mace C, Kiddle-Monroe R, Pinel J. Substandard medicines in resource-poor settings: a problem that can no longer be ignored. Trop Med Int Health. 2008 Aug; 13(8), 1062-72" id="20">(20)</a>, where quality is de facto  														demand-driven. But is this situation ethically acceptable?  														If health is a human right, can we accept the fact that quality  														of medicines will depend on market mechanisms rather  														than on regulation? If health is a human right, the creation of  														the conditions needed to achieve access to health belongs  														to the sphere of relationships between the State and the  														individual <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hogerzeil HV. Essential medicines and human rights: what can they learn from each other? Bull World Health Organ. 2006 May; 84(5):371-5." id="1">(1)</a>. Thus, the State A-and not the market A- has a  														primary responsibility toward citizens (persons) to create such  														conditions, including both the control of prices and assurance  														of the quality of essential medicines. If the State does not take  														this responsibility, we will keep on tolerating a status quo where  														people may or may not have access to quality healthcare  														depending on the strength or weakness of the market. In  														fact, we advocate that States should not delegate this healthrelated  														matter to the market. In the same way, States should  														not delegate the agenda of pharmaceutical research and  														development to the traditional business-oriented private sector  														that, being based on market incentives, has failed to address  														the needs of neglected populations.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, a lot is being done to ensure affordable prices of  														essential medicines, but more should be done to ensure their  														quality. This may be achieved, in practice, by strengthening and  														enforcing regulation, instead of letting prices and quality be  														determined by market-mechanisms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Poor regulation is generally associated with nonavailability  														of resources and industrial backwardness, as is the case in  														low-income sub-Saharan African countries <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. An assessment of medicines regulatory systems in Sub-Saharan African countries: An overview of findings from 26 assessment reports [Internet].. Geneva:WHO;2010 Nov12[cited 2013 Mar17]. Available from: http://www.who.int/healthsystems/ Assessment26African_countries.pdf" id="21">(21)</a> and in some  														countries of Latin America and the former Soviet Union. In the  														case of India, conversely, there seems to be an unexpected and  														disproportionate gap between the outstanding technological  														advancement in the national pharmaceutical sector, and the  														State's capacity to regulate pharmaceutical quality. This gap  														inevitably leads to a variable level of protection of patients <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravinetto R, Boelaert M, Jacobs J, Pouget C, Luyckx C. Poor-quality medical products: time to address substandards, not only counterfeits [Internet]. Trop Med Int Health. 2012 Nov [cited 2013 Apr 2];17(11):1412-6. Available from: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365- 3156.2012.03076.x/full" id="22">(22)</a>,  														and embeds a dramatic contradiction: while the Indian generic  														sector has the potential to fulfil the promise of affordable  														essential medicines to patients, in its own country as well as in  														others, a poor regulatory environment with unequal multiple  														standards might cause direct harm to public health, especially  														to the poor and needy, in India and elsewhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to directly threatening the well-being of patients,  														the poor regulation is endangering confidence in the generic  														industry as a whole; and the de-legitimisation of the generic  														industry brings an indirect yet major harm to global health.  														In fact, quality-assured Indian generic medicines are essential  														to promote the scaling-up of essential treatments in lowincome  														countries, and they put positive pressure on the global  														pharmaceutical market towards fair pricing of pharmaceuticals <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medecins Sans Frontieres. Access campaign. Untangling the web of antiretroviral price reduction [Internet]. 15th Edition. 2012 Jul[cited 2013 Mar18]. Available from: http://utw.msfaccess.org/" id="23">(23)</a>. The current situation of "variable standards" (due to  														"variable regulation") of the Indian pharmaceutical sector  														decreases confidence in the generic manufacturing sector as  														a whole. The resulting, generalised lack of confidence concerns  														not only "bad products", but also and unjustly all thosegeneric products that are indeed of good quality, affordable  														and essential to fulfil the ethical imperative of universal access  														to quality medicine.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The way forward: fair regulation for global health</h4>
				<p>
					In this brief reflection we are not able to address all the  														intricacies of pharmaceutical production and its impact  														on global health. Nonetheless, it appears that the variable  														regulation of medicine quality in India has both direct and  														indirect negative consequences for public health. On the one  														hand, it may allow poor quality medicines to reach patients,  														causing unnecessary morbidity and mortality, mainly among  														the most vulnerable populations in India and elsewhere; on  														the other, it delegitimises its own quality products, which are  														fundamental to expand health coverage at both national and  														global levels. It is vital to solve the current paradoxical situation,  														where the Indian pharmaceutical sector concurrently appears  														as a threat and an essential contributor to public health.
				</p>
				<p>
					The positive signals are there in that the State is willing to  														fulfil its ethical obligations toward individuals and community:  														notably, the minister of state for health announced in 2012 that  														the central government will work at strengthening regulatory  														policies for food and drug sectors, and that the task will be  														integrated in the 12th Five Year Plan. On the same lines, India's  														drug regulators recently announced a plan that would put  														tight restrictions on the sale of antibiotics, in a renewed effort  														to fight the emergence of antibiotic resistance <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Westly E. India moves to tackle antibiotic resistance. Nature.2012;489:192" id="24">(24)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is urgent that these important announcements are followed  														by implementation, accompanied by the necessary investments  														in financial and human resources, to overcome the current gap  														between the outstanding effort to make essential medicines  														available and affordable on one side, and the insufficient effort  														to adequately ensure their quality on the other. As Indian civil  														society and health policymakers debate the possible steps  														for India to progress towards universal health coverage, the  														time is ripe for effective drug regulation. Further, we would  														like to suggest that the Indian regulators make an effort to  														acknowledge the role that the Indian pharmaceutical industry  														is playing de facto on the global stage and adopt a collaborative  														approach <em>vis-a-vis</em> the regulators of the developing countries  														to which Indian products are exported. A proactive exchange  														of "quality information" (e.g., results of inspections, results  														of product assessments, etc.) would concretely help the  														regulatory agencies of low-income countries to prevent the  														import of poor quality medicines.
				</p>
				<p>
					A well-regulated and transparent pharmaceutical sector in  														India is essential to further building and maintaining universal  														access to quality healthcare and true global equity in the right  														to health for all..
