					Efforts  such as the World Health Organization's 3x5 Initiative bring with them new  challenges, along with the hope and promise of expanding access to  antiretroviral treatment (ART) in developing countries. Some challenges are  practical or technical: Will a sufficient number of volunteers undergo HIV  tests to determine their eligibility for treatment? Will there be enough rapid  test kits available for all the people who will have to be tested? Equally  challenging are questions of ethics and equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  editorial in the July-September 2004 issue of the Journal <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A, Kalantri SP, Thomas G, Srinivasan S. Government-funded anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS: new ethical challenges. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2004;1:70-1." id="1">(1)</a> describes some of  the ethical challenges this initiative faces in India. This includes the  ongoing discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS in both public and  private sectors, the injustice evident in the selection of the sites where free  access to ART will be offered, and the potential for corruption due to bribery  in rejecting or selecting patients for free treatment. Although these and other  ethical challenges are not unique to India, they are based on evidence from  current and past discriminatory practices and unjust distribution of health  care resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  editorial asks, 'How can the selection process be impartial and objective if  the profession that is supposed to implement it has shown discriminatory  behaviour?' The only way to accomplish this is to adhere to <em>procedural fairness</em> while selecting both the sites where free ART will be available and the  individuals who will be eligible to receive the treatment. Elements necessary  for achieving procedural fairness are discussed below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Community  involvement</h4>
				<p>
					Involvement of communities is a prerequisite for procedural fairness.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Transparency</h4>
				<p>
					Groups involved in setting priorities must use democratically developed,  unambiguous criteria in taking decisions about the individuals or groups that  will receive treatment. 'Public accountability in the form of open, democratic  processes is a fundamental requirement of justice because people must  understand what principles and reasoning are used in choices that affect their  basic well-being <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Daniels N, Light DW, Caplan RL. Benchmarks of fairness for health care reform, New York: Oxford University Press, 1996:57." id="2">(2)</a>.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Decisions  about which categories or groups should have access to ART and the rationale  for these decisions should be 'reasonable' in that it should appeal to reasons  and principles that are accepted as relevant by the stakeholders. Such  decisions must be publicly accessible <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Last chance therapies and managed care: Pluralism, fair procedures, and legitimacy, The Hastings Center Report. 1998;28:27-41. (Based on criteria for legitimacy and fairness specified in Daniels N, Sabin JE." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Inclusiveness</h4>
				<p>
					Those involved in the decision-making process at all levels should include a  wide range of individuals and groups. Policy-makers and members of advisory  boards should include persons with HIV infection and their family members,  people from different backgrounds&mdash;language, cultural, educational and class.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Impartiality</h4>
				<p>
					This criterion is required to avoid conflicts of interest. For example,  stakeholders should not be involved in the decision-making process which sets  priorities for their own group to receive ART.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Due  process</h4>
				<p>
					There should be a mechanism for challenge and revision of the chosen scheme,  including the opportunity for revising decisions about priorities in the light  of further evidence and changing circumstances <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Last chance therapies and managed care: Pluralism, fair procedures, and legitimacy, The Hastings Center Report. 1998;28:27-41. (Based on criteria for legitimacy and fairness specified in Daniels N, Sabin JE." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Accountability</h4>
				<p>
					There should be some form of accountable regulation of the process to ensure  that the above conditions are met <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Last chance therapies and managed care: Pluralism, fair procedures, and legitimacy, The Hastings Center Report. 1998;28:27-41. (Based on criteria for legitimacy and fairness specified in Daniels N, Sabin JE." id="3">(3)</a>. In addition to embodying elements of  procedural fairness, implementation of the 3x5 Initiative must also respect  human rights and adhere to substantive principles of ethics and equity.  Although adherence to human rights provisions in scaling up treatment  programmes is essential, none of the various human rights treaties or  declarations provide specific criteria for setting priorities or choosing among  potentially relevant principles of equity. As treatment programmes are rolled  out, it will not be possible for every eligible person to be treated at once.  What criteria should decision-makers use to set priorities for access? Are  there ethically acceptable grounds for choosing special groups, such as health  care workers, to ensure effective implementation of treatment programmes? Can  giving preference to children or pregnant women be ethically justified? There  is no clear and uncontroversial way of determining which groups in a population  should be given the priority when all cannot be treated at the outset.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ideally,  the 3x5 Initiative should provide ART free of charge through public health care  institutions. This would ensure not only that the poor will not be excluded  from the scaling up of ART, but also that priority will be given to the large  number of people in developing countries for whom existing treatments have not  been affordable and who would continue to be excluded if they had to pay  out-of-pocket. Moreover, practically, evidence from existing programmes in  which people in developing countries have had to pay for some or all the cost  of antiretroviral drugs reveals an array of negative medical and social  consequences, including interruption of therapy, deterioration of health  status, poor adherence, and development of drug resistance.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  argument in favour of giving priority to the poor is supported by a leading  ethical principle: concern for the worst off or the least advantaged. In the  context of health care delivery, this is usually understood to refer to those who  are worst off in terms of health status, but it could also apply to the poorest  members of society; the lowest socioeconomic class; the most vulnerable (for  example, children, especially orphans); or groups that are marginalised or most  discriminated against. The principle that favours the least advantaged and the  most vulnerable groups does not, however, call for giving strict priority to  these groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other  ethical principles are potentially relevant and can provide justifications for  choosing one or the other scheme for access to ART. The utilitarian principle,  applied specifically to health policy, aims at maximising <em>health benefits</em> for  society as a whole. For example, treating health care personnel or teachers  would have the additional benefit of ensuring that needed personnel are  available for providing treatment and for health promotion, which produces  additional health benefits for society. Similarly, treating factory workers  rather than children or unemployed people produces economic benefits for the  country which, in turn, could be used to increase treatment access. However,  giving priority to the more productive members of society would perpetuate the  exclusion of individuals and groups who have historically lacked access to  health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					An egalitarian  principle of equity in this context would call for distributing resources  equally among persons, or distributing health care services equally among  different groups. This principle is the basis for schemes that emphasise health  equity over health maximisation. There is thus a conflict with the utilitarian  approach. The goal is to reduce disparities in health status among different  groups or strata in society: the poor, women, people living in rural areas,  ethnic or racial minorities, and others.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  three principles described here point to criteria or concerns that must be  considered, but the principles can lead to conflict, and it then becomes  necessary to balance competing concerns. There is no unique, correct way of  achieving this balance. For this reason, leading commentators have urged that  the emphasis has to be on fair processes <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Daniels N. How to achieve fair distribution of ARTs in 3 by 5: fair process and legitimacy in patient selection, prepared for the WHO consultation on Ethics and Equity in the 3x5 Initiative, Geneva, Switzerland, January 26-27, 2004. Available from URL: http://www.who.int/ethics/en/background-daniels.pdf" id="4">(4)</a>. The aforementioned principles can  serve to justify the decisions to the extent that decision-makers in each  country can agree on principled ways to set priorities for equitable access  among those eligible for ART.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  different option for setting priorities could focus initially on applying  principles of equity to institutions that provide health care services to  individuals and groups likely to be HIV-infected. These would include both  urban and rural health facilities, general public hospitals, and specialised  clinics or facilities. Whichever approach is chosen, the use of the fair  procedures described earlier remains necessary, since equity demands adherence to  both substantive and procedural aspects of ethics.
