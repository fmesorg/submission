					I am one of those who,  according to Radcliffe-Richards et al, oppose the practice of buying kidneys  from live vendors from a feeling of "outrage and disgust." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radcliffe-Richards J, Daar AS, Guttman RD, et al, for the International Forum for Transplant Ethics. The case for allowing kidney sales. Lancet 1998: 351: 1950-52." id="1">(1)</a> These  feelings are by no means irrational. They are based on a bedrock of moral principle:  that no human being should exploit another. The opponents and proponents of the  trade in human organs are divided by this (perhaps unbridgeable) chasm &ndash; the  one side is wedded to the belief that not only are all human beings born free,  but that they should stay free; the other is not so sure. The evolution of  human civilisation has witnessed several periods of gross exploitation of human  beings. Slavery, the extermination of six million Jews, and today the transfer  of body parts from one living human being to another, for a financial  consideration, are part of a continuum of values which sees some human beings  as less valuable than others. It is this value system that those of us who  oppose the sale of kidneys, seek to change. All arguments in favour of the trade  are attempts to clothe, in the garb of reason, the concept that it is all right  to remove a body part from a poor person and put it into a rich one. But even  these arguments will not bear scrutiny and I will deal with them below.
				</p>
				<p>
					First,  the argument that the prohibition of organ sales worsens the position of the  poor because it removes an option in their already deprived lives: Here the  authors <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radcliffe-Richards J, Daar AS, Guttman RD, et al, for the International Forum for Transplant Ethics. The case for allowing kidney sales. Lancet 1998: 351: 1950-52." id="1">(1)</a> of the paper have cleverly stated the most potent contrary argument  themselves: the solution is the removal of poverty. They, however, appear to  consider this a distant possibility, and in the meantime advocate the selling  of kidneys as one option available to the poor to better their circumstances.  It would have been useful if the authors had adduced material to show how and  how long this so-called option works. In the absence of any sustained means of  livelihood, it is quite probable that the money obtained by the sale of one  organ will soon be gone. What shall the seller do next? Sell another organ? An  eye? A lung? And when all the paired organs are gone?
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us accept that the  risk involved in nephrectomy is not high. But is it not a fundamental tenet of  medicine that the risk must be in the medical interest of the patient? What  medical advantage does the donor obtain? Undoubtedly the risk is the same for  those who sell and those living donors who do not sell but donate out of regard  for the recipient. Radcliffe -Richards et al move from this fact to the  inference that therefore there should be no difference between the two groups  with surprising facility. What matters here is motive: the implicit coercion in  the case of the poor who sell out of financial compulsion. Radcliffe - Richards  equating of the motives of the better off, and comparing the risks of nephrectomy  with the risks of dangerous sports can only be described as callous. No one  prevents them from campaigning against these sports if they are so moved, but  for us activists in the Third World there are more pressing matters than  looking after the well - being of the jet- set. A profile of the sellers would  be revealing. It will come as no surprise that they all belong to the Third  World. And it will also come as no surprise that besides the wealthy in the  Third World, the potential buyers will be from the rich, white, First World and  from the petroleum driven nouveau - riche! No wonder a veritable industry of  philosophers has risen in these countries to justify this horrible practice.  And in the honourable tradition of colonialism there will always be locals  ready to aid and abet the conquerors. He who pays the piper calls the tune!

					Radcliffe-Richards et al <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radcliffe-Richards J, Daar AS, Guttman RD, et al, for the International Forum for Transplant Ethics. The case for allowing kidney sales. Lancet 1998: 351: 1950-52." id="1">(1)</a> seem fixated on the belief that legalising and controlling the trade in  human organs will protect the exploited. The situation in other fields shows  that this is naive indeed. In Hamburg, legal commercial sex workers throng the  glittering Reeperbahn, while in the sad, sordid, shadowy bylanes the illegal  commercial sex workers have no shortage of clients. This in a country where  social conditions ensure much closer adherence to the rule of law than is the  case in most developing countries, which are the main source of people willing  to sell their organs. In India, child labour is a reality. Poverty is the main  reason for its existence. The efforts of numerous groups have succeeded in  making it illegal. Have they removed an 'option' for the poor? After all, the  poor consciously send these children to work. Would it be a good idea to  legalise the practice and control it on the theoretical basis that it would  improve the lot of these unfortunate children? There are many reasons why such  trades will always be open to exploitation. The most potent one is that the  victims are poor and voiceless while the beneficiaries are generally rich and  powerful.
				</p>
				<p>
					The argument that organ  selling is acceptable because some services are available to the rich, which  are not available to the poor, is extremely strange. Do the authors believe  that the presence of undesirable practices justifies adding a few more? What will  the limit be? Who will decide how many more are to be allowed? No prizes for  getting it right. The answer is: the rich and powerful. Permit whatever is in  their interest. They can always hire a motley crew of philosophers and  technicians to justify it and make it possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why is altruism necessary in  organ donation? It is because it will ensure the absence of exploitation. It is  nobody's case that unless some useful action is altruistic it is better to  forbid it altogether. Altruism removes the profit - making element. It will  help ensure that organ transplantation is done in the best possible way and  thereby achieve the best possible medical result. It will also ensure that no  vital organ is removed from a living person. On the other hand, trade in kidneys  definitely puts one on the slippery slope to selling vital organs as documented  elsewhere. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P (eds). Brain death and organ transplantation in India. Page 30. The National Medical Journal of India, New Delhi 1990." id="2">(2)</a> Here, the authors utilise the familiar stratagem of positing and  demolishing imaginary weak arguments against their stated position, while  ignoring the real and powerful argument.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors end with an  emotional appeal that feelings of repugnance among the rich and healthy cannot  justify removing the only hope of the destitute and dying. A powerful statement  indeed, but on whose behalf? Is the only hope for the destitute the sale  of body parts? Is this modern form of slavery where one sells oneself  piecemeal, as opposed to the old form where the entire person was sold the only  hope for the poor of the 21st century? Or are the authors unaware that there is  enough for all if only the rich were not so greedy? <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Antia NH. Global policies and peoples health. Natl Med J India 1993; 6: 1-3" id="3">(3)</a> Although they  themselves state that the real solution to selling is the removal of poverty,  they quickly move on to the reasons why selling is acceptable today. The entire  tenor of their article suggests that they are not interested in this the real  option. Perhaps it is difficult to push this idea in the West where the  dominant paradigm is to maintain the current wasteful level of living, never  mind that it is at the direct cost of millions of other human - beings living  elsewhere. How much easier to go for the soft option of buying kidneys from the  poor and making this appear as good for both the seller and the buyer. As for  the dying, it is clear that the authors are not concerned about the poor who  are dying, as they cannot afford transplantation and all the costs after  transplantation. As for those who can afford transplantation, is the transfer  of a kidney from a poor person really the best option? People who have  undergone dialysis do not seem to think it such an unpleasant experience, as  the authors would have us believe. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lyon S. Organ donation and kidney sales. Lancet 1998; 352: 483 - 492" id="4">(4)</a> Let us not forget also that  transplantation is not the end of the story but that the patient has to be on  lifelong immunosuppression, which is quite an expensive proposition. However,  it is true that many who would be helped by transplantation are unable to get  an organ. The real solutions lie in popularising cadaver transplantation and  increasing the donation rate from the brain-dead, and working on technology to  make dialysis cheaper and more (tolerable). Radcliffe - Richards et al state  that a vendor will never be a potential donor even after death. This is by no  means certain. Methods can be found to increase donation rates from the brain -  dead and from cadavers. One has only to see the amazing success of the Sri  Lankan eye donation programme to understand what can be achieved. This is the  difficult option but the only sustainable one. Nothing can justify using one  human being as an organ farm for another.

				<h4>Excerpts from the World Medical Association statement on human organ and tissue donation and transplantation, adopted by the 52nd WMA General Assembly in Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000</h4>
				<h5>Physicians' obligations</h5>
				<p>
					"The WMA considers that policies and protocols
					concerning organ and tissue donation and transplantation
					must be developed in recognition of the medical ethics
					that underlies the practice of medicine and the patientphysician
					relationship..."
				</p>
				<h5>Values</h5>
				<p>
					"The expression of compassionate concern for others
					suffering from ill health and disability through voluntary
					altruistic giving," "free and informed decision making about
					medical treatments," "Privacy and the dignity of the
					patient," "timely access, on just and equitable terms and
					conditions, to necessary and effective medical treatment
					... "
				</p>
				<h5>Social aspects to organ and tissue procurement</h5>
				<p>
					"Awareness and choice should be facilitated in a
					coordinated multi-faceted approach by a variety of
					stakeholders and means... "
				</p>
				<h5>Institutional and individual obligations</h5>
				<p>
					"Physicians have an obligation to ensure that interactions
					at the bedside, including those discussions related to organ
					donation, are sensitive and consistent with ethical
					principles and with their fiduciary obligations to their
					patients..."
				</p>
				<h5>Free and informed decision making</h5>
				<p>
					"... the potential donor's wishes are paramount. In the event
					that the potential donor's wishes about donation are
					unknown and the potential donor is ...unable to express
					his/her will, the family or a specified other person may serve
					as a substitute decision-maker ..."
				</p>
				<p>
					"In order for the choice to donate organs or tissues to be
					duly informed, prospective donors or their substitute
					decision makers should, if they desire, be provided with
					meaningful and relevant information..."
					"Protocols for free and informed decision making should
					also be followed in the case of recipients..."
				</p>
				<h4>Living donors</h4>
				<p>
					"special efforts should be made to ensure that the choice
					about donation is free of coercion... Individuals who are
					incapable of making informed decisions, for example
					minors or mentally incompetent persons, should not be
					considered as potential living donors except in very limited
					circumstances, in accordance with ethics committee review
					or established protocols...the physician who obtains
					informed consent from the living donor should not be part
					of the transplant team for the recipient..."
				</p>
				<h5>Justice in access</h5>
				<p>
					"... there should be explicit policies open to public scrutiny
					governing all aspects of organ and tissue donation and
					transplantation, including the management of waiting lists
					for organs and tissues to ensure fair and appropriate access..."
					"Payment for organs and tissues for donation and
					transplantation should be prohibited. A financial incentive
					compromises the voluntariness of the choice and the
					altruistic basis for organ and tissue donation. Furthermore,
					access to needed medical treatment based on ability to pay
					is inconsistent with the principles of justice... However,  reasonable reimbursement of expenses ...is  permissible."
