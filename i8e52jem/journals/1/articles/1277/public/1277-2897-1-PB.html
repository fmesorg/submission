					There are many who  believe that transplantation represents one of the most spectacular  achievements of modern medical science. Advances from many fields of medicine  have contributed to a tremendous improvement in results over the decades. This  has lead to a steep rise in the numbers of transplants being performed.  Transplantation has also raised some of the fiercest ethical controversies in  modern medicine. In a way it is not surprising that a field which involves the  removal of human organs from a living or dead individual to save the life of  another individual should throw up strange ethical dilemmas. Perhaps no other  field of medicine has raised so many complex and intertwined ethical, moral,  legal and social issues. Even from the Indian perspective the 'kidney  bazaar' as it was rather crudely but aptly termed remains one of the biggest  ethical controversies to hit the public domain in the last decade.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the increased  inflow of personnel and knowledge from the developed world transplantation of  solid organs is being attempted in increasing numbers in India. Simultaneously  with the introduction of a specific act called the Transplantation of Human  Organs Act (HOTA) in 1994, the way has also been paved for performing 'cadaver'  transplants from 'brain dead' patients. The Act, which was partially a response  to the public outcry about the 'organ trade' in the early 90's, is also meant  to monitor organ trading. Reports from the field indicate that the act has not  really succeeded in achieving its main objectives, namely, to promote cadaver  transplantation and to curb trading in organs.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a journal trying to  raise discussion relating to the ethical practice of medicine in India we have  in the past carried articles on various aspects of transplantation ethics . We  thought that this was an opportune time to revisit some of the ethical  controversies in this collection of articles.

				<h4>Historical evolution</h4>
				<p>
					Mythology is not medical  history but many religious texts are replete with stories and figures where  human organs are replaced by animal ones. The 'miracle' of Saint Cosmos and  Saint Damien from Christian mythology as described in the 'Lives of the Saints'  needs mention at least for the bizarre similarity it has to modern  transplantation in more than one ways. Saint Cosmos and Damien were  called upon to treat a priest afflicted by a cancer of his leg and the two  saints went to the nearest graveyard where an 'Ethiopian' had just been buried  , took off his leg and used it to replace the priest's leg.
				</p>
				<p>
					The British surgeon John  Hunter in the late 18th century successfully transplanted a human tooth on to a  hen's comb and thus made some of the first scientific attempts at animal  transplantation. However it was really in the 20th century that transplantation  caught the fancy of the medical fraternity and became a reality. The first  attempt at human solid organ transplantation was made by a Russian surgeon, Voronoy,  who unsuccessfully transplanted a kidney from a cadaver into the thigh of a  patient suffering from renal failure. In 1946, surgeons in Boston first  successfully transplanted the human kidney, between two identical twins. This  was followed by the liver in 1963 and the heart in 1967. Today, many other  organs including the lung, pancreas and intestines are also being transplanted  with varying degrees of success. Transplantation of organs like the kidney,  liver, and heart is no longer regarded as experimental but an established  therapy by the WHO <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Human Organ Transplantation. Report by the Director General, EB 79/8. World Health Organisation, Geneva. 1986." id="1">(1)</a> and around 50,000 such transplants are being annually  performed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The kidney, being a  paired organ can be removed from a living person, whereas the heart and the  liver have to be removed from dead individuals. In the initial stages, removing  organs from an individual who was 'dead' as per our classic understanding of  death, that is, when the heart had stopped, was attempted. This was largely  unsuccessful, since for an organ to be viable it had to be removed within  minutes of cessation of heartbeat, which was an impractical proposition. This  is unlike the 'cornea' or the eye, which remains viable for a few hours and  hence can be removed after some time has elapsed after death. In the last  three decades, the concept of 'brain death', a state where the brain is  irreversibly damaged but the heart is beating, came into being in the Western  world. 'Death' as we understood it over the years was redefined. 'Brain death'  represents a state of irreversible damage to the brain which over a period of  time (12 to 36 hours) inevitably leads to stoppage of the heart (cardiac  arrest). This is typically seen in patients with severe head injury, massive  stroke, brain tumors, brain hypoxia, and as a complication of neurosurgery. Such  brain dead individuals or 'heart beating donors' are in intensive care units  (ICUs) on artificial respiration, and removal of organs from them is performed  as an operative procedure. Almost all transplants in the developed world are  now done in this fashion.
				</p>
				<p>
					French physicians first  described the concept of brain death in 1959, before the era of organ  transplantation. However it was then legalised and popularised due to its  implications for organ transplantation. Till recently, 47 countries in the  world had accepted 'brain death' as a legal concept and 39 countries had  enacted specific laws on organ transplantation <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P: Brain death and organ transplantation in India. The National Medical Journal of India, New Delhi. Pages 70. 1990." id="2">(2)</a>. The form and method of  obtaining consent for removal of organs from brain dead individuals has varied.  Generally, two forms of consent have been practised. The commonest form of  consent is 'informed consent' in which close family members agree to donate  organs of the deceased after 'brain death'. This involves the treating doctor  motivating the family for organ donation after 'brain death' has been  certified. Even in the West, doctors have been observed to be reluctant to do  so for the fear of inviting the wrath of family members in an emotionally  charged situation and only about 30 to 40 per cent of families actually give  consent. The other form of consent is called 'presumed consent'. This grants  authority to doctors to remove organs from brain dead individuals whenever  usable organs are available, in the absence of objection from the deceased in  his or her lifetime, or his family members. Presumed consent places the burden  of opting out of organ donation on those who object to this procedure. This  system has been legalised in European countries like Austria, Belgium, Denmark,  Finland and France. Vijay Rajput in an article in this issue <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajput V: Addressing the organ shortage. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 54-55." id="3">(3)</a> examines  presumed consent in detail.
				</p>
				<p>
					In spite of many  measures to promote organ donation, the discrepancy between 'demand' and  'supply' of organs continues to grow. In 1994, around 3,000 patients waiting  for an organ died in the USA. As more and more patients are put on transplant  waiting lists the desperation to look for methods to increase the  'supply' of organs has increased. Transplant surgeons have resorted to the use  of organs from animal species in a process called xenotransplanatation. So far  kidneys, livers and hearts have been transplanted from non-human primates  commonly the baboon to man. Besides raising animal rights issues, there have  been ethical objections to the purely 'experimental' nature of such procedures  where the patients were made 'guinea pigs'. These issues are discussed in  detail by Vijay Rajput <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajput V: Addressing the organ shortage. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 54-55." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once consent for removal  of organs has been obtained from relatives of brain dead patients, intimation  is given to networks, which coordinate transplant programmes between various centres.  The organs are distributed based on a 'waiting list' where recipients are  prioritised. With organs being in short supply there is a scope for  considerations like money, influence, race and nationality creeping into the  distribution system. In choosing the recipient, another debate that has  raged for a long time is whether to transplant the sickest patients since they  need the organ most but also have the poorest chance of survival, or to  transplant relatively healthy patients in whom the result is better and hence  the organ is utilised better. In patients with diseases resulting from  addictions, such as liver disease due to alcoholism, it has been debated  whether a transplant should be performed at all since the disease has been  brought on by an addiction and there is a chance that the patient could go back  to the same addiction. In general, the question has been raised whether given  the shortage of organs the medical profession should sit on moral judgment  about diseases that are preventable or should it purely go by the medical merit  of the case.

				<h4>Transplantation and  religious beliefs</h4>
				<p>
					Transplantation has  thrown up peculiar and complicated religious and moral questions. For example  if a heart is removed from a cadaver, does it mean that it is now devoid of a  'soul'? Also, will removal of organs in any way affect the process of  'rebirth'? Both Roman Catholics and Protestants tend to support organ donation,  believing that God's power to resurrect the body will not be thwarted by prior  disposal of its parts. Jewish law prohibits deriving benefit from mutilating or  delaying the burial of a corpse but this prohibition can be overridden to save  a life. The Islamic Organization of Medical Sciences passed a resolution many  years back recognising brain death <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P: Brain death and organ transplantation in India. The National Medical Journal of India, New Delhi. Pages 70. 1990." id="2">(2)</a> and many Islamic countries are now  performing cadaver transplants. The only big religious group, which till  recently opposed the idea of brain death, is the Shintos in Japan. Thus  Japan, a country otherwise extremely advanced medically was unable to start  cadaveric transplantation of organs till recently when the Japanese Parliament  gave a go ahead. Swami Lokeshwarananda of the Ramkrishna Mission is  reported to have said in a seminar in 1988 that Hindu and Vedic scholars accept  the concept of brain death <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P: Brain death and organ transplantation in India. The National Medical Journal of India, New Delhi. Pages 70. 1990." id="2">(2)</a>. The concept of 'giving' or 'daan' is  ingrained in Hindu thought and therefore there seems to be no major religious  objection to the act of organ donation. Activists of organisations  involved in mobilising people for organ donation report that they have received  hundreds of inquiries from citizens desiring to donate their body/organs after  death. The eye donation movement in India has never faced any significant  religious resistance. A survey by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in  Bombay revealed that the majority of respondents irrespective of religious and  economic status were in favor of organ donation <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pande GK, Patnaik PK, Gupta S, Sahni P: Brain death and organ transplantation in India. The National Medical Journal of India, New Delhi. Pages 70. 1990." id="2">(2)</a>.

				<h4>The Indian scenario</h4>
				<p>
					In India a majority of  patients with end stage disease of potentially transplantable organs presently  die of their disease. In the case of kidney failure some are on long-term  dialysis an alternative inferior to transplantation. Till the passage of the  Transplantation of Human Organs Act there was no comprehensive legislation  regulating the removal of human organs. In 1991, the Central government  constituted a committee to prepare a report, which could form a basis for  all-India legislation. Although the main terms of reference of the committee  were concerned with 'brain death', it also recommended that trading in human  organs be made a punishable offense. The Transplantation of Human Organs Act  was thus passed by Parliament in 1994. The act legalises 'brain death' making  removal of organs permissible after proper consent. The first few hundred such  cadaver transplants have been performed mainly in the metros in the last two to  three years but the activity in the field is well below what was expected or  what is needed. On the other hand, the Act also seeks to regulate non-related  live donation of organs and makes commercial trading an offense. It makes it  mandatory for institutions conducting transplants to register with  an authority appointed by the state government. This authority will also  enforce standards, investigate complaints and inspect the hospitals regularly  to monitor quality. All persons associated in any way with hospitals conducting  transplants without the proper registration are liable for punishment. Thus, it  is probably for the first time that an external body has been given legal  powers to scrutinise and monitor the activities of medical institutions. The  Act also lays down criteria for determining brain death. Many safeguards  against misuse have been built in the rules. The brain death tests must be  performed by four individuals together, none of whom has anything to do with  the transplant, and this must be done twice, with a minimum gap of six hours.  Such brain death can be declared only in institutions recognised by state  appropriate authority. The written consent can be obtained only from a close  relative. There are problems peculiar to the Indian situation that have already  come up in the practice of cadaveric transplantation. Firstly the Act links  'brain death' and 'transplantation', which as Sunil Pandya and Harsha Deshmukh  state in their articles <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK: 'Brain death' and our transplant law. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 51-52." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="eshmukh H: Problems in cadaver transplantation. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 53" id="5">5)</a> is a fundamental flaw. The diagnosis of brain  death is made in ICUs where the facilities for keeping a brain dead patient's  organs working with mechanical ventilation, cardiac support and intensive  monitoring exist. Such ICUs are few and are a part only of big hospitals in  major cities. They are usually overloaded, understaffed and lack a central  command structure. Given this situation, brain dead patients have traditionally  been given low priority and treated with 'benign neglect'. When such patients  become donors, they would require the attention like any other patient to keep  the organs viable till they are removed. This would require a major attitudinal  change and could be resented by an already overburdened staff. When other,  salvageable patients often lack the required medical attention, is it ethical  to lavish such care on the dead? Harsha Deshmukh, a transplant coordinator  involved in the early cadaver transplants in Mumbai in a view from the field  puts forth some of the practical problems <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Deshmukh H: Problems in cadaver transplantation. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 53" id="5">(5)</a> that are being already  experienced.

				<h4>'Rewarded gifting': the unrelated donor</h4>
				<p>
					The 'Indian kidney  bazaar' has been a subject of much discussion and three of the articles in this  issue focus on this controversy. For a long time an organised network of  doctors and middlemen lured people in desperate need of money into 'donating'  their kidneys, which were transplanted into the wealthy, including a large  number of Arab patients. These operations were often performed in sleazy  nursing homes with little respect for basic transplant principles. With the  passage of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act much of this activity died  down. The discovery of an organised racket in NOIDA on the outskirts of  Delhi a few years back showed that the racket has probably moved from the  metros to smaller places. In what many believe is a major loophole the HOTA  allows for donation from a non-related person as long as the intentions of such  a donation are scrutinised by committee in every state. It is now common  knowledge that the number of such 'altruistic' donations forms a significant  percentage of transplants. As Dr MK Mani from Chennai puts it in a recent  article, "Dozens of slum dwellers from Chennai have this great and  transcending love for millionaires from Kanpur or Calcutta, whom they could not  have met more than a few weeks earlier. Truly this is love at first  sight." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mani MK. Making an Ass of the Law. Letter from Chennai. Natl Med J India 1997; 10: 242-3." id="6">(6)</a> A certain new line of argument from western philosophers in  favor of 'organ selling' supported by some from the international transplant community  has appeared in the last few years. We carry two pieces <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kyriazi H: The ethics of organ-selling: a liberatarian perspective. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 44-46." id="7">(7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Radclife Ricahrds J: Organs for sale. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 47-48." id="8">8)</a> which more than  adequately convey the gist of this argument, and a response from India <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="George T: The case against kidney sales. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 49-50." id="9">(9)</a>. The  question that is likely to be asked time and again however is: what are the  options for a patient who desperately requires an organ transplant for survival  but does not have a close relative to donate the same, or does not get a  cadaver organ? Finally, transplantation is a costly affair and this poses an  ethical dilemma in itself. In addition to the cost of the procedure which  runs into lakhs of rupees the patient has to bear a life-long recurring cost of  Rs.7,000 to Rs 8,000 per month for immunosuppressive medication. The idea of  equity in health care, which now rightfully occupies an important place in  ethics, assumes a rather stark dimension in the field of transplantation. For  the common man who is caught in the pincer of an ill-equipped and crumbling  public sector and a costly private sector transplantation is in reality a very  distant dream.

				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<p>
					This review has  attempted to discuss some of the historical aspects as well as the areas of  debate in the field of organ transplantation and some of these areas are  detailed in the accompanying articles. An effort has been made to emphasise the  Indian scenario. With the passage of time and advances in the field many more  areas for ethical debate are likely to emerge. Given the events of the last few  decades it is a sad reality that at least in this country organ transplantation  has come to be associated more with commerce than science and healing.  For those who desire to provide the benefits of this advance in medical science  to people at large in an ethical and equitable fashion, it is indeed going to  be a daunting challenge to try and change this state of affairs
