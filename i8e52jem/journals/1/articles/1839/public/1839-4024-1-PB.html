				<h4>Health professionals  and human rights</h4>
				<p>
					Amnesty International (AI) urged the World Health Organisation  (WHO) to support health . professionals in documenting violations of human  rights
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors and nurses have been killed and jailed because they  refused to cover up medical evidence of torture and other abuses or gave  medical care to government opponents.
				</p>
				<p>
					In an 46 page report, the human rights organization said doctors  have been coerced sometimes by law -- into assisting at amputations, and have  been threatened for treating protesters, or pressured to issue false medical  reports.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'Medical evidence of abuse is a powerful aid in search for  justice by those who have been ill- treated which governments are often anxious  to cover up.'</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					In launching its report -- which gives examples from 12  countries -- the organization called on the WHO, the United Nations,  governments and national medical associations to strengthen mechanisms for the  reporting of human rights violations.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Iraq in 1994, doctors were required by law to amputate the  ears and brand the foreheads of military and civilian 'deserters'. Doctors were  told that if they refused the same would happen to them. One doctor was reportedly  executed and many were imprisoned for their refusal to carry out these orders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some doctors assist governments passively through tolerance of  abuses or actively through advice and assistance in the coverup of human rights  violations. '<em>The vulnerability of doctors or nurses results from the absence  of a strong collective refusal to compromise ethical and professional  standards. It is time for the principles of rights and ethics to be realised</em>. '
				</p>
				<p>
					Health professionals and medical associations can contribute to  the prevention of different abuses by refusing to be exploited in any way for  the purpose of torture, interrogation or punishment. Moreover, they can assist  the detection, documentation and exposure of human rights violations. The  medical examination of prisoners at the time of arrest and regularly during  detention is a potential safeguard against physical and mental abuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, a doctor at the Bone and Joint Hospital in Srinagar  said that a prisoner who had to have both feet amputated after developing  gangrene, had in fact been kept on ice resulting in frost bite, that acid had  been sprinkled on his feet and that all his blood capillaries had been  destroyed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Turkish -Medical Association has carried out a number of  investigations into complicity of doctors, nurses and other health  professionals in torture, in Turkey, including an inquiry initiated in 1995  into an apparent medical coverup of torture. Two physicians had prepared  medical reports alleging that Ahmetzcil had not been tortured while he was kept  in custody despite other reports verifying torture.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Kenya, there have been several incidents of the police  attempting to influence what doctors write in the reports of their medical  examinations of detainees, especially when it is obvious a suspect has been  tortured. One doctor said: '<em>Many times I have been advised [by police] to stop writing  medical reports on torture victims</em>. '
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1995, the Bahraini security authorities reportedly warned  doctors that if they treated any of those wounded during anti- government  protests, they would suffer repercussions. They also prevented ambulances from  taking some of the wounded to hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'Some governments showing a cynical disregard for ethics, try to  put pressure on doctors to produce false evidence or no evidence at all. Health  workers who see the results of human rights abuses daily need support obviously  from their professional associations but also from the wider community.  Governments should be accountable for their suppression or manipulation of  medical evidence.'</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					If medical examinations and investigations are to play any role  in protecting prisoners certain minimum conditions must be met. Currently these  are not met in many countries. In its new report, Amnesty International  documents a number of reasons for the failure of health professionals to  effectively expose human rights violations and calls for these impediments to  ethical practice to be addressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO should undertake more initiatives and give a higher priority  to the defence of health professionals under threat for carrying out the  ethical practice of their profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					The organization's health professionals network, which has  members in more than 30 countries, will be undertaking a campaign on these  themes over the next six months.

				<h4>Amnesty International  answers commonly asked questions</h4>
				<p>
					AI has issued the following circular to international health  professionals answering commonly asked questions on its campaign on violations  of human rights:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> What  is the AI campaign about?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> AI  wants governments to address the fact that human rights violations are  frequently not investigated adequately or at all. In some cases, doctors and  other health professionals who have evidence of human rights abuses are subject  to pressure to stay silent. In other cases, they are pressured not to include  certain facts in their medical reports or even to falsify medical documentation  in order to hide abuses. In a minority of cases, doctors are actively complicit  in abuses. AI wants governments to act and wants to encourage the international  community and particularly health bodies such as the World Health Organization  and the World Medical Association to take action to address the suppression .of  medical evidence in human rights cases. It also wants to support the work of  local human rights organizations and professional bodies which are tackling  these problems. This human rights problem is illustrated in the AI report,  Prescription for Change: Health Professionals and the Exposure of Human Rights  Violations. (For a free copy of this report write to CEHAT, 519 Prabhu Darshan,  S. S. Nagar, Amboli, Andheri (West), Bombay 400 058.)
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> Why is AI conducting a campaign at this time?
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> This  human rights problem is long- standing and AI has had concerns about the  suppression of both legal and medical evidence of human rights violations for  many years. It is campaigning now for action in the light of continuing  evidence of risks faced by health professionals in many countries and the  failure of governments to encourage, use or protect medical expertise in the  search for justice in cases of human rights violations. Q. What does AI hope to  achieve by this campaign? A. There are a number of goals for this campaign. To  put effective pressure on governments to respect, protect and strengthen the  medical and medico-legal role in exposing human rights violations. To encourage  the international health sectors, WHO and the various professional associations  to take action to address the problem of pressure on health professionals to  cover up human rights violations.To support and encourage local human rights  activists, individual professionals and those professional associations who are  working to expose abuses and to press associations to monitor ethical  standards. Where such work is not being carried out or is being thwarted for  whatever reason, AI wants to stimulate it. AI has prepared Principles for the  Medical Investigation of Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment  which it is urging governments to adopt. These would contribute to the  documentation of torture and the protection of detainees.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> Which  countries are the worst for repressing doctors or pressuring them to falsify  medical evidence?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> AI does not compare countries or list best or  worst countries. The AI report Prescription for Change gives a number of  examples of countries where the suppression of medical evidence, silencing of  health professionals or lack of professionals skills contribute to the covering  up of human rights abuses. In Turkey, doctors have complained that police  prevent the writing of honest and accurate medical reports and there is  evidence that medical reports may actually assist the cover up of torture [see  report p. 1,15,21,27]. In India, a prisoner had both feet amputated after being  tortured and not being seen early by a doctor [p. 16]. In Kenya, a doctor was  arrested in November 1993, just before he was due to present medicalevidence in  court on behalf of several political prisoners [p. 27]. In Peru, two doctors  have been sentenced to 22 years imprisonment after false accusations by  arrested members of the armed opposition; AI has adopted them as prisoners o f  conscience.[ p. 26] I n Mexico, AI medical delegates examined two prisoners who  showed signs of ill- treatment; the prisoners had received inadequate medical  care in detention and had been given false medical certification There are many  other countries with major human rights abuses not covered in the report which  does not pretend to be definitive. AI will be individual incidents with  particular governments throughout the period of the campaign and in they come  to the organization. the future notice 0f when the organisation
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> Is AI saying that doctors -and nurses have  greater obligations to report human rights violations than ordinary citizens?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> What AI is saying is that health professionals  have opportunities to see people at risk of abuses, to witness the effects of  such abuses and ethical obligations to take action; these are very particular  to the health professions. Medicine is dedicated to the protection of life and  the well- being of the patient. With their access to potential victims and  their professional ethics, health professionals have a particular role to play  in the exposure of abuses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> There must be times when health professionals  cannot report abuses because it is just too dangerous to do so?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> AI is encouraged by the number of such health workers who  maintain respect for their patients and their- ethics even in the face of  serious risk. In many cases, health professionals have shown that it is  possible to act ethically and remain at liberty. In some cases doctors have  been prosecuted for promoting ethical behaviour in the face of state opposition  and some doctors have even been killed for their adherence to human rights  standards. AI believes that asking individuals to resist oppressive forces by  themselves reduces the chances of effective resistance to repressive power,  even if it welcomes examples of such courageous behaviour. The organisation  therefore seeks . to encourage governments to make clear that threats and  actual harm must never be used to silence health professionals; to persuade the  international health community, in particular the WHO, that it has a  significant role to play in promoting the protection of health workers; and to  persuade professional associations to fulfil their role in protecting their  membership and monitoring standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> What can professional associations do to defend medical ethics  and human rights in the face of government repression?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> Some associations have undertaken persistent  and commendable activities in defence of human rights over a long period under  difficult conditions. The report gives examples of action taken by the Turkish  and Peruvian medical associations both of which have investigated the situation  of doctors under emergency legislation and have supported their own members at  risk of unjustified prosecution. Others have taken little action in  circumstances when they reasonably could have been expected to speak out. The  determining factor is not just the power of the government or the risks  involved but the will of the association to act. AI hopes to persuade  associations during the course of this campaign that there are strong reasons  for taking action in defence of human rights and in support of members who may  face risks because of their wish to practice their profession ethically.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> What  about governments? Don't they have legitimate rights to combat terrorism which  may mean restricting the rights of doctors? If doctors treat terrorists surely  they have to accept being punished?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> Medical ethics do not support the view that doctors should  withhold medical treatment from anyone. When called upon to give medical care,  it is the doctor's responsibility to give that care or to refer the patient on  to another doctor who can provide care. It is widely recognised that doctors  have ethical obligations to maintain confidentiality and to act in their  patients' interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> Does AI's call for doctors to have the  unrestricted right to see violent guerillas amount to a call for special  privileges for terrorists?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> AI does not support 'terrorism' or 'terrorists'. It calls for  the protection of human rights whether they are under threat from the state or  from armed opposition groups. It calls for the protection of the health  professional's role as carer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> How  can we believe doctors' reports of torture? Not all of them are experts in  detecting torture and some may have a political agenda.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> There are well recognized methods for the carrying out of  medical examinations and the preparation of medical reports. A doctor writing a  report documenting torture must expect to have that report scrutinised by other  doctors. AI commonly asks experienced doctors to evaluate medical evidence  submitted to the organisation and through this peer review has been able to  come to its own judgments about the accuracy or credibility of medical reports  of torture.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> Surely  some countries can't afford the resources to put into forensic medicine?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> The problems documented in the AI report are not usually the  result of lack of training but are caused by de1 i berate decisions, either by  military, security or police officers to pressure a doctor into falsifying a  certificate or report, or by doctors who deliberately breach their professional  ethics and collude with the authorities. In some cases, inadequate reports  result from lack of proper training or experience but these are generally not  the root of the problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Q.</strong> What does AI want done when a doctor collaborates with the  authorities by falsifying reports or helping to cover up abuses?
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>A.</strong> AI  believes that all alleged cases of medical participation in human rights  violations should b e thoroughly investigated by professional associations and,  where there is prima facie evidence of an illegal action by a doctor or other  health professional, by law enforcement agents. During such an investigation,  any mitigating circumstances, such as the existence of coercion against the  doctor, should be taken into account. Those who are under severe pressure to  cooperate with those carrying out human rights violations should not, in AI's  view, be simply condemned; they should be given a fair chance to explain their  actions.
