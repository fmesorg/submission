				<h4>Am I a bogus doctor?</h4>
				<p>
				I am moved to write this letter to your journal after reading an  essay in the <em>Journal of Association of Physicians of India</em> by Dr B M Hegde, who  I consider one of the living legends of medicine. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hegde BM. Is academic medicine for sale? JAPI 2001; 49: 831-832." id="1">(1)</a> I have often discussed  the issue of sponsorshop, to which Dr Hegde refers, but rarely have my  colleagues listened to me. This is a subject of much interest to <em>Issues in  Medical Ethics.</em></p>
				<p>In 1998, I was invited to APICON, to present my life's research  on the scorpion sting, within 20 minutes. A company selling anti-hypertensive  and anti-diabetic drugs sent me an air ticket and informed me they would be  putting me up at a big hotel in Bangalore. The PRO indicated that I should be  writing about his product. I immediately returned the ticket and sent a message  to the organisers that I would be happy to spend the night at a bus-stand or  railway platform, rather than have my stay sponsored. I went to the conference  by road. When I reached there, my sponsored colleagues were surprised to see me  there.</p>
				<p>I notice at these conferences that few attendees go to the academic  section; the long queues are reserved for the dinner and cocktails. Sometimes companies  organise a single lecture for which they provide a two-day stay for doctors and  their families. At Mahad, many pharmaceutical companies arrange CMEs with  cocktails and dinner, but have to borrow a projector from me. They pay for the  (air) travel and stay of guest speakers and even attendees. I have refused  travel and staying allowance even as a guest speaker, something which has kept  me away from sponsored programmes; I am no longer invited for these programmes  even when all my colleagues are. For example, a conference on non-insulin  diabetes (NIDUS 2001) was held at the Hotel Subbean, at Pattaya, Thailand, from  August 10 to 12, 2001. This was aimed at the general practitioner, and indeed  my colleagues in my city were invited, but I was not.</p>
				<p>I am swimming against the  stream, and I am being treated as an outcast by my colleagues, as if I am a  bogus doctor. Doctors need to think about principles and ethics if they  are to maintain the dignity of this noble profession. </p>
