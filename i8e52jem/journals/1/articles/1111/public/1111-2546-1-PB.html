				<h4>Temporary  incompetence</h4>
				<p>
					<em>How  can one ensure that a mentally ill patient who is temporarily unable to make  choices receives optimal treatment?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  paper and the editorial address this difficult situation, which is different  from that in which patients are permanently incompetent to take decisions.  Here, patients can be temporarily incompetent. As a result of treatment&mdash;which  they may reject while incompetent, but which can be forced on them against  their wishes&mdash;they gain the mental competence to question the very treatment  that makes them competent. In this case, patient autonomy exists but cannot be  absolute. This poses an ethical dilemma as one must act in the best interest of  the patient or what the patient would have wished for if able to make  appropriate choices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  authors suggest obtaining patients' advance statements giving their treatment  preferences in case their decision-taking ability is later impaired. This  reduces the forced hospitalisation of patients. The editorial points out that  though this appears admirable, many patients in the study refused to  collaborate in this joint exercise for various reasons.

				<h4>Breaking  bad news</h4>
				<p>
					In India, increasingly, patients with terminal cancer want to be involved in  decision-making. This study shows how grim facts can be communicated  sensitively. The researchers found that patients receiving palliative care  valued the process of information sharing as much as the information itself.  The process of communicating diagnosis and prognosis affects how information is  perceived. Six necessary attributes were identified: playing it straight,  staying the course, giving time, showing you care, making it clear, and pacing  information.

				<h4>Case  studies and discussions on ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The editorial introduces a new series of everyday cases in the British Medical  Journal with discussions of the ethical issues involved. It notes that medical  ethics is not a mere academic exercise but affects routine patient care.  Doctors may not realise that they make value judgements as they care for  patients. Yet good medical practice requires that such value judgements are  properly analysed and assessed, just as scientific and technical evidence is  properly evaluated. Doctors need to assess the merits of various competing  courses of action, and be able to justify their decisions in ethical terms.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  first case study concerns genetic testing of family members. The discussion  notes that advances in genetics are creating more dilemmas for doctors, patients  and their families as it becomes possible to prevent genetic diseases.  Geneticists often find themselves in a quandary when a family member refuses to  share information with others at risk. Does genetic information belong to the  patient from whom it was obtained or to the whole family?
				</p>
				<p>
					The key  ethical question is whether the foreseeable harms of non-disclosure to the  whole family are sufficiently serious to justify breaching patient  confidentiality. Genetic testing is usually done only after assessing the  family history and the results should be viewed as belonging to the family&mdash;the  joint account model. Under such a model the patient would have to be at risk  for serious harm to justify not sharing information.

				<h4>Conflicts  in genetic databases</h4>
				<p>
					The authors argue that fundamental personal genetic privacy may need to be  compromised to develop genetic databases. They call on all people to contribute  to the development of genetic research within the framework of a regulatory  system that would give due weightage to social, cultural, legal and ethical  considerations. They also call for cooperation between developed and developing  countries.

				<h4>Restricting  access to data</h4>
				<p>
					Medical researchers, specifically epidemiologists, have been allowed  confidential access to medical records throughout the ages, and until recently  such access without informed consent was explicitly allowed under the UK  Medical Research Council's guidelines on research. Following media reports on  breaches of confidentiality, the UK government proposed restrictions on  researchers' access to data. The writer argues that the proposed new law will  hamper legitimate and potentially beneficial research.

				<h4>Conflicts  of interest</h4>
				<p>
					While some journals do not publish opinion pieces written by authors with  declared potential conflicts of interest, the Annals of Internal Medicine  sometimes does. The editors explain why. The primary objectives of a medical  journal are to describe research accurately and to discuss interpretations and  limitations fairly. For the author, the secondary objective may be anything  (financial gain, a personal relationship, intellectual passion) that leads to  overstating or denigrating research results, selectively withholding pertinent  data or discussion, or exaggerating or minimising the shortcomings of the  research. Journals typically use two main weapons to address conflict of  interest: disclosure (of conflict) and exclusion (of the writer). Disclosure of  conflicts is becoming universal. Exclusion may be harmful as often individuals  with the greatest expertise have potential conflicts. The problem is finding a  way to maximise the benefits of that expertise while minimising the risk for harm  from real or perceived bias because of a potential conflict of interest. The  editors of this journal use several ways to avoid undue bias in articles. They  consider the transparency of the author's argument, strength of the evidence  and value of the piece in stimulating discussion; they exert greater than usual  editorial oversight; they may invite someone to write an article with a  contrasting point of view or encourage authors who want to respond to a  critique.

				<h4>Dealing  with treatment-related harm</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Health  care can cause harm through inadvertent errors. How one accepts and deals with  these errors will determine the level of trust that patients will develop in  their health care system.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  painful paradox is that, by lavishing health care on our patients, we may also  be exposing them to a potential hazard. Patients need to be made more aware of  the level of risk involved in a particular course of treatment and their  complaints must guide the system. If injured, they deserve rehabilitation,  explanation and even compensation. Just as employees harmed at work might  expect redressal for the unwanted and possibly unanticipated risk to which they  have been exposed, patients harmed at a hospital might also welcome an  environment in which their claims can be heard. In New Zealand, for example,  treatment injury is dealt with by the Accident Compensation Corporation as a  special case of accidental harm without the need for litigation.

				<h4>Cross-cultural  views on ethics</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Do  various religions assist in the elucidation of current ethical issues in  medicine? The following articles address the perspectives of Hinduism and  Buddhism.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  first article discusses the virtues of management, efficiency, dynamism and  striving for excellence in the context of the holistic Hindu perspective of  lokasangraha&mdash;for the welfare of many. The second article looks at Buddhism as a  resource for discussions in modern bioethics. The Buddhist 'middle way' ethic,  based on the concept of interdependence, and the Buddhist emphasis on intention  as an important ingredient in ethical decisions, are useful in discussing grey  areas in bioethics. The Buddhist understanding of death as a process and not an  event, supports the total brain death approach, which prohibits the premature  removal of organs for transplantation. The Buddhist approach to dying and  acceptance of death facilitates discussions on euthanasia and care for the  dying. Finally, an essay assesses the relation of Hindu religious thought, from  the Hindu concepts of personhood, reincarnation and the connection between  moral and social concerns to abortion ethics, and how this differs from the  western debate.

				<h4>Guidelines  for cyber health care</h4>
				<p>
					E-health is an emerging field in the intersection of medical informatics,  public health and business. It includes health services and health information  delivered or enhanced through the internet and related technologies. E-health  can empower lay persons to become health-literate and health-responsible, and  to make educated choices about lifestyle and quality of life. However, E-health  will also change the established local systems of health care and caring for  patients. The authors propose a set of interactive action guides for cyberspace  health care communication and communities.

				<h4>Debates  on male circumcision</h4>
				<p>
					The June 2004 issue of the <em>Journal of Medical Ethics</em> carried a mini symposium  on circumcision. Four of the seven essays are described here. In the lead article,  'Irreversible bodily interventions in children', S J Holms notes that we do not  worry as much about other irreversible bodily and mental interventions to which  parents subject their children. The acceptability of an intervention depends on  the risk and magnitude of permanent harm&mdash;physical, and later conscious  rejection of the procedure. We do not have valid comparative data on the  effects of early circumcision on adult male sexual function and satisfaction.  Until such data become available, the debate on circumcision cannot be brought  to a satisfactory conclusion, and there will always be a suspicion that the  opposition to circumcision is partly driven by cultural prejudices, dressed-up  as ethical arguments. In 'Circumcision: a surgeon's perspective', J M Hutson  speculates on whether the practice may have evolved as a hygiene measure and  then goes on to say that the most fundamental principle of surgery is that no  operation should be done if there is no disease; it cannot be justified if the  risk of the procedure is not balanced by the risk of a disease. The surgical  argument for circumcision of all neonatal males at present is weak, and with  the rising public health standards in the developed world, it is likely to  remain weak. In 'The development of professional guidelines on the law and  ethics of male circumcision', R Mussell refutes the charge that the British  Medical Association's guidelines are worthless because these explore the issues  without either firmly rejecting or accepting non-therapeutic male circumcision,  asserting that the deliberation has been beneficial in several ways. In 'Value  judgment, harm, and religious liberty', AM Viens argues that in the absence of  sufficient evidence or persuasive argumentation, the current policy is justified,  in which parents have the freedom to choose infant male circumcision.<h5 class="other-journals">Holm  SJ.

				<h4>The  four principles and Islam</h4>
				<p>
					Little is known about teaching medical ethics across cultural and linguistic  boundaries. This study conducted in an Arabic country showed that students with  even a brief introduction to western medical ethics were able to identify and  discuss complex ethical issues. This suggests that 'ethical principles as  espoused in the four-principle approach may be common to the students' Islamic  religious beliefs'.

				<h4>Off-label  use of drugs</h4>
				<p>
					A recent controversy in India concerns the off-label prescription of the cancer  drug letrozole. Two editorials respond to this controversy, and to the Indian  Medical Association's (IMA) recent policy statement supporting off-label  prescription. It is argued that the IMA's policy statement was designed to  defend the administration of letrozole as an ovulation-inducer. An article in  the same issue argues that the prescription of letrozole was in fact an  informal clinical trial by the drug company, using the help of doctors. It also  describes the legal requirements for drug research in India. <h5 class="other-journals">Editorial.  Which side of the wall are you, IMA? BODHI 2004;58:33-4.</h5>

				<h4>Live  operative workshops</h4>
				<p>
					This debate between two surgeons on the value of live operative workshops  outlines opposing points of view. The first author, writing in response to a  letter opposing such workshops, states that while there are problems, they can  be powerful educational tools. The second author argues that live operative  workshops are marketing strategies with serious ethical problems.
