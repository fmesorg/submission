					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Duties and responsibilities of the physician in general:</strong>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					1.1.1 A physician shall uphold the dignity and honour of his profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.1.2 The prime object of the medical profession is to render service to humanity; reward or financial gain is a subordinate consideration. Whosoever chooses his profession assumes the obligation to conduct himself in accordance with its ideals. A physician should be an upright man, instructed in the art of healings. He shall keep himself pure in character and be diligent in caring for the sick; he should be modest, sober, patient, prompt in discharging his duty without anxiety; conducting himself with propriety in his profession and in all the actions of his life.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.1.3 No person other than a doctor having qualification recognised by Medical Council of India and registered with Medical Council of India/State Medical Council(s) is allowed to practice the modern system of medicine or surgery. A person obtaining qualification in any other system of medicine is not allowed to practice the modern system of medicine in any form.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.2 Maintaining good medical practice:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					1.2.1 The principal objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect for the dignity of profession and man. Physicians should merit the confidence of patients entrusted to their care, rendering to each a full measure of service and devotion. Physicians should try continuously to improve medical knowledge and skills and should make available to their patients and colleagues the benefits of their professional attainments. The physician should practice methods of healing founded on scientific basis and should not associate professionally with anyone who violates this principle. The honoured ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to individuals but also to society.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.2.2 <strong>Membership in medical society:</strong> For the advancement of his profession, a physician should affiliate with associations and societies of allopathic medical professions and involve actively in the functioning of such bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.2.3 A physician should participate in professional meetings as part of continuing medical education programmes, for at least 30 hours every five years, organised by reputed professional academic bodies or any other authorised organisations. The compliance of this requirement shall be informed regularly to the Medical Council of India or the State Medical Councils as the case may be.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3 Maintenance of medical records:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					1.3.1. Every physician shall maintain the medical records pertaining to his/her indoor patients for a period of 3 years from the date of commencement of the treatment in a standard proforma laid down by the Medical Council of India and attached as
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Appendix 3.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					1.3.2. If any request is made for medical records either by the patients/authorised attendant or legal authorities involved, the same may be duly acknowledged and documents shall be issued within the period of 72 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.3.3 A registered medical practitioner shall maintain a register of medical certificates giving full details of certificates issued. When issuing a medical certificate he/she shall always enter the identification marks of the patient and keep a copy of the certificate. He/She shall not omit to record the signature and/or thumbmark, address and at least one identification mark of the patient on the medical certificates or report. The medical certificate shall be prepared as in
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Appendix 2.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					1.3.4 Efforts shall be made to computerise medical records for quick retrieval.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.4 Display of registration numbers:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					1.4.1 Every physician shall display the registration number accorded to him by the State Medical Council/Medical Council of India in his clinic and in all his prescriptions, certificates, money receipts given to his patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					1.4.2 Physicians shall display as suffix to their names only recognised medical degrees or such certificates/diplomas and memberships/honours which confer professional knowledge or recognise any exemplary qualification/achievements.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.5 Use of generic names of drugs:</strong> Every physician should, as far as possible, prescribe drugs with generic names and he/she shall ensure that there is a rational prescription and use of drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.6 Highest quality assurance in patient care:</strong> Every physician should aid in safeguarding the profession against admission to it of those who are deficient in moral character or education. A physician shall not employ in connection with his professional practice any attendant who is neither registered nor enlisted under the Medical Acts in force and shall not permit such persons to attend, treat or perform operations upon patients wherever professional discretion or skill is required.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.7 Exposure of unethical conduct:</strong> A physician should expose, without fear or favour, incompetent or corrupt, dishonest or unethical conduct on the part of members of the profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.8 Payment of professional services:</strong> The physician engaged in the practice of medicine shall give priority to the interests of patients. The personal financial interests of a physician should not conflict with the medical interests of patients. A physician should announce his fees before rendering service and not after the operation or treatment is under way. Remuneration received for such services should be in the form and amount specifically announced to the patient at the time the service is rendered. It is unethical to enter into a contract of "no cure no payment". Physician rendering service on behalf of the state shall refrain from anticipating or accepting any consideration.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>1.9 Evasion of legal restrictions:</strong> The physician shall observe the laws of the country in regulating the practice of medicine and shall also not assist others to evade such laws. He should be co-operative in the observance and enforcement of sanitary laws and regulations in the interest of public health. A physician should observe the provisions of the State Acts like Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940; Pharmacy Act, 1948; Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985; Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971; Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994; Mental Health Act, 1987; Environmental Protection Act, 1986; Pre-natal Sex Determination Test Act, 1994; Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act, 1954; Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities and Full Participation) Act, 1995 and Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and such other Acts, Rules, Regulations made by the central/state governments or local administrative bodies, or any other relevant Act relating to the protection and promotion of public health.

				<h4>CHAPTER 2. DUTIES OF PHYSICIANS TO THEIR PATIENTS </h4>
				<p>
					<strong>2.1 Obligations to the sick:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					2.1.1 Though a physician is not bound to treat each and every person asking his services, he should not only be ever ready to respond to the calls of the sick and the injured, but should be mindful of the high character of his mission and the responsibility he discharges in the course of his professional duties. In his treatment, he should never forget that the health and the lives of those entrusted to his care depend on his skill and attention. A physician should endeavour to add to the comfort of the sick by making his visits at the hour indicated to the patients. A physician advising a patient to seek service of another physician is acceptable, however, in case of emergency a physician must treat the patient. No physician shall arbitrarily refuse treatment to a patient. However for good reason, when a patient is suffering from an ailment which is not within the range of experience of the treating physician, the physician may refuse treatment and refer the patient to another physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					2.1.2 A medical practitioner having any incapacity detrimental to the patient or which can affect his performance vis-&agrave;-vis the patient is not permitted to practice his profession
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>2.2 Patience, delicacy and secrecy</strong> : Patience and delicacy should characterise the physician. Confidences concerning individual or domestic life entrusted by patients to a physician and defects in the disposition or character of patients observed during medical attendance should never be revealed unless their revelation is required by the laws of the State. Sometimes, however, a physician must determine whether his duty to society requires him to employ knowledge, obtained through confidence as a physician, to protect a healthy person against a communicable disease to which he is about to be exposed. In such instance, the physician should act as he would wish another to act toward one of his own family in like circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>2.3 Prognosis</strong> : The physician should neither exaggerate nor minimise the gravity of a patient's condition. He should ensure himself that the patient, his relatives or his responsible friends have such knowledge of the patient's condition as will serve the best interests of the patient and the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>2.4 The patient must not be neglected:</strong> A physician is free to choose whom he will serve. He should, however, respond to any request for his assistance in an emergency. Once having undertaken a case, the physician should not neglect the patient, nor should he withdraw from the case without giving adequate notice to the patient and his family. Provisionally or fully registered medical practitioner shall not wilfully commit an act of negligence that may deprive his patient or patients from necessary medical care.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>2.5Engagement for an obstetric case</strong> : When a physician who has been engaged to attend an obstetric case is absent and another is sent for and delivery accomplished, the acting physician is entitled to his professional fees, but should secure the patient's consent to resign on the arrival of the physician engaged.
				</p>

				<h4> CHAPTER 3. DUTIES OF PHYSICIANS IN CONSULTATION</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>3.1 Unnecessary consultations should be avoided</strong> :
				</p>
				<p>
					3.1.1 However, in case of serious illness and in doubtful or difficult conditions, the physician should request consultation, but under any circumstances such consultation should be justifiable and in the interest of the patient only and not for any other consideration.
				</p>
				<p>
					3.1.2 Consulting pathologists /radiologists or asking for any other diagnostic lab investigation should be done judiciously and not in a routine manner.
				</p>
				<p>

					3.4.1 All statements to the patient or his representatives should take place in the presence of the consulting physicians, except as otherwise agreed. The disclosure of the opinion to the patient or his relatives or friends shall rest with the medical attendant.
				</p>
				<p>
					3.4.2 Differences of opinion should not be divulged unnecessarily but when there is irreconcilable difference of opinion the circumstances should be frankly and impartially explained to the patient or his relatives or friends. It would be opened to them to seek further advice as they so desire.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3.5 Treatment after consultation:</strong> No decision should restrain the attending physician from making such subsequent variations in the treatment if any unexpected change occurs, but at the next consultation, reasons for the variations should be discussed/explained. The same privilege, with its obligations, belongs to the consultant when sent for in an emergency during the absence of attending physician. The attending physician may prescribe medicine at any time for the patient, whereas the consultant may prescribe only in case of emergency or as an expert when called for.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3.6 Patients referred to specialists:</strong> When a patient is referred to a specialist by the attending physician, a case summary of the patient should be given to the specialist, who should communicate his opinion in writing to the attending physician.
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>

				<h4> CHAPTER 4. RESPONSIBILITIES OF PHYSICIANS TO EACH OTHER </h4>
				<p>
					<strong>4.1 Dependence of physicians on each other :</strong> A physician should consider it as a pleasure and privilege to render gratuitous service to all physicians and their immediate family dependants.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>4.2 Conduct in consultation :</strong> In consultations, no insincerity, rivalry or envy should be indulged in. All due respect should be observed towards the physician in-charge of the case and no statement or remark be made, which would impair the confidence reposed in him. For this purpose no discussion should be carried on in the presence of the patient or his representatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>4.3 Consultant not to take charge of the case:</strong> When a physician has been called for consultation, the consultant should normally not take charge of the case, especially on the solicitation of the patient or friends. The consultant shall not criticise the referring physician. He/she shall discuss the diagnosis treatment plan with the referring physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>4.4 Appointment of substitute:</strong> Whenever a physician requests another physician to attend his patients during his temporary absence from his practice, professional courtesy requires the acceptance of such appointment only when he has the capacity to discharge the additional responsibility along with his/her other duties. The physician acting under such an appointment should give the utmost consideration to the interests and reputation of the absent physician and all such patients should be restored to the care of the latter upon his/her return.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>4.5 Visiting another physician's case:</strong> When it becomes the duty of a physician occupying an official position to see and report upon an illness or injury, he should communicate to the physician in attendance so as to give him an option of being present.
