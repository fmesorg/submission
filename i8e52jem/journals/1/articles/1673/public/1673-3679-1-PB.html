				<h4>Private colleges use municipal hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Civic groups have criticised the BMC's proposal to allow students of Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate (HSNC) Board to use the facilities at Bhagwati Hospital, Borivli, and Centenary Hospital, Kandivli, for clinical training. The college management is supposed to spend Rs. eight crore to upgrade facilities within four years, and furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 5.5 crore. Students will use the 485 beds here at Rs. 20 a day. After renovation, the college can use the facilities for 30 years, after which it will be reviewed. A similar contract, for D Y Patil medical college to use Rajawadi Hospital, has not resulted in any construction eight years after the contract was signed.

				<h4>Working conditions in mortuaries</h4>
				<p>
					At least 40 per cent of the doctors and attendants working in different mortuaries in New Delhi suffer from tuberculosis and other ailments due to unhygienic conditions at the workplace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Minimum safety standards are not adhered to, personnel are not provided with protective gloves and masks, overcrowded mortuaries are not properly cleaned, unqualified doctors practice as forensic experts and nursing orderlies are recruited as morgue attendants.

				<h4>Winner of the cleanest hospital</h4>
				<p>
					It is hard to believe that the BMC run tuberculosis hospital complex in Sewri qualifies as a hospital, harder to imagine it won an award for cleanliness last year. The huge cracks along with parapets, in the walls and ceilings, mean indoor umbrellas in the monsoons; water shortages prevent proper cleaning of the rooms. Officials agree that work needs to be done, but are reluctant to commit themselves to a time.

				<p>
					Following the death of a boy in a Chennai hospital and the consequent arrest of 21 fake doctors, the Tamil Nadu government announced the implementation of the Tamil Nadu Private Hospitals Regulation Act with immediate effect on May 12. The Act was passed by the Assembly last year but could not be implemented following protests from the doctors' community which sought amendments.

After a two year delay in installing the Rs. 12 crore equipment, the government-run hospital faces an acute shortage of MRI films as well as staff. For at least one week, patients were being sent back with just a written report &mdash; not enough for a specialist to diagnose the problem. Twelve lucky patients have their scans stored in the machine; the rest will have to come back for retesting.

				<h4>Clean up &mdash; by throwing the patient out</h4>
				<p>
					In the course of 'sprucing up' for the UP health minister's visit on June 29, employees of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya District hospital in Moradabad reportedly tried to dispose of a patient who didn't smell too good. A 35-year-old man was brought to the hospital by the Railway Police with severe and multiple injuries, with no identification and unable to communicate. The chief medical superintendent says a staff nurse gave the 'eviction' orders when he wasn't around. The nurse says she's being framed; she heard of it from the cleaning staff. While it is not clear exactly who was responsible, everyone agrees that the nameless accident victim was in shape, was not being attended to, and had somehow been transported from a third-floor hospital ward to some bushes near the building compound wall.

				<h4>Jeevandayi's back</h4>
				<p>
					The Supreme Court vacated the stay on the Maharashtra government's Jeevandayi Health Scheme, saying it was essential to provide free treatment to people below the poverty line. In doing so, the court rejected the contention of the Mumbai-based Association of Private and Charitable Hopsitals that the scheme was arbitrary and against the provisions of law.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Mumbai-based Association of Private and Charitable Hospitals had won a stay on the November 6, 1997 Sena-BJP government order to provide free treatment to poor patients in 18 hospitals, including 11 in the metropolis. However, on July 21 this year, the state government filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenging the interim order.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scheme's details were laid under the framework of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, which makes it binding on the managements of charitable hospitals to reserve at least 10 per cent of their beds for poor patients. The health minister's contention was that since the government was extending huge concessions in terms of additional floor space index and sales tax rebates to charitable hospitals, they should oblige the government by giving free treatment to poor patients.

				</p>
				<p>
					The 365-bed hospital does not have a resident anaesthetist, like most peripheral municipal hospitals, and must rely on a panel of anaesthetists who are paid Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 per operation &mdash; a pittance compared to what they get at private clinics. All 10 anaethetists contacted that morning refused to come, citing prior responsibilities.

The deaths occurred within a span of three weeks, suggesting an unusually high mortality rate, according to those specialists who were willing to comment. The head of the department maintained that none of the deaths was related to the procedures performed.

				</p>
				<p>
					Dr NH Banka and Dr PB Desai were directed to appear before the court on the basis of a complaint by Jyoti Raghunath that her husband, who was suffering from a stomach ailment, was wrongly operated upon. Dr Banka advised surgery for stomach cancer. Raghunath was operated upon by Dr Desai on April 25, 1996 and thereafter advised chemotherapy. However, when his condition deteriorated it was found that Dr Desai had only performed an exploratory laparotomy, and not removed the malignant part &mdash; contrary to what Mrs. Raghunath believed. After obtaining a statement from another doctor, the magistrate issued a showcause notice to Dr Banka and Dr Desai.

				<h4>More on doctors and the CPA...</h4>
				<p>
					A Supreme court decision on a case filed under the Consumer Protection Act (Harjot Singh Ahluwalia v Spring hospitals) awarding damages to the parents of a child left permanently brain-damaged because of medical negligence provoked the formation of the Forum of Medical Consultants, a Mumbai-based organisation as a pressure group to fight medico-legal cases and tackle medical infrastructural inadequacies. From the many letters commenting on the new organisation :
				</p>
				<p>
					"<em>The most important aspect of the Harjot Ahluwalia case is that the wrong injection was given by an unqualified nurse. This highlights the abysmal state of infrastructual facilities in the health care field</em>."
				</p>
				<p>
					"<em>The Association for Consumer Action in Safety and Health (ACASH) [has found] the majority of complaints are either about failure of communication between the doctor and patient, or about poor infrastructural facilities. The fear of increased cost of health care is untenable. Cheaper health care should not be equated with acceptance of gross acts of negligence. It is necessary that the medical profession gives up its 'siege mentality' and undertake some serious introspection</em>"
				</p>
				<p>
					"<em>The CPA is a social legislation and its basic principle is system correction. If the medical profession doesn't take a rational and objective look at dysfunctional systems in the health care field and initiate corrective steps, more legislations like the CPA are inevitable</em>."

					Nasir was taken all over the country for what he thought was a job. The last of these stops was apparently Harkisondas Narrotamdas hospital, Mumbai, where Nasir says he was made to sign a blank sheet of stamp paper and given an injection, after which he passed out. When he regained consciousness a nurse told him he had donated his kidney. He says he was held in the hospital till he managed to escape.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Harkisondas hospital denied that anybody under the name of Nasir Ali had undergone a kidney transplant operation, but admitted that 'a certain Nasir Ali' had undergone a number of tests performed before kidney transplant and other kidney-related procedures at its outpatient department, following written consent. The hospital's medical director said Ali was referred to the hospital by two outside doctors, but refused to divulge their names.

				<h4>High-tech success or false claim?</h4>
				<p>
					In a May 1998 press conference, Dr S. Sumeet and Sumita Sofat, who run the Sofat Infertility and Women Care Centre, Ludhiana, announced that they had helped 61-year-old Karanjit Kaur conceive. The high-tech pregnancy was said to have been made possible with the help of various hormones and in-vitro fertilisation. The Sofats stated that a urine pregnancy test was positive after two weeks and an ultrasound scan showed a live foetus at six weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					But when Karanjit Kaur returned to her village in Ferozepur after the IVF, she developed complications, and eventually had to undergo a dilatation and curettage to remove an 'incomplete abortion'. Strangely, a histopathology test did not confirm pregnancy. An inquiry was launched into the incident, but called off when the Sofats challenged the inquiry team's qualifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Naresh Bassi, secretary of the Indian Medical Association, says, "<em>A majority of professional colleagues do not believe the Sofats' claim</em>," and has demanded a government inquiry by a competent team &mdash; incidentally, something the Sofats also welcome. However, Karanjit Kaur says she has been through enough.

					When the Supreme Court acted on a public interest litigation on commercial blood banks, and shut all commercial banks as of January this year, it may have acted rashly, according to some activists.

The focus should be on ensuring quality blood, not banning commercial supplies, argue V B Lal, president of the Indian Association of Blood Banks and manager of Delhi's largest private blood bank, and Dr Ute Schumann, head of the Berlin-based Charite International Health project. Without building a cadre of voluntary blood donors, the PIL and the resulting SC ban have created a crisis.

The company reportedly bought the blood for $ 9 million, selling it for $ 80 million. A company employee notified the country's health ministry.
