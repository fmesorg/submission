			<h3>Ethics of professional advertising</h3>

				<p>
					Dr. Pandya makes three basic points in his editorial
					against professional advertising by physicians in
					India: Professional advertising is unethical; Dr.
					Malpani makes unsubstantiated claims in his web site; and
					unrestricted commercial advertising in India with its lack of
					effective regulatory oversight will lead to further exploitation
					of patients.
				</p>

				<h4>Ethics of professional advertising</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Pandya's reasons for considering advertising unethical
					while cogent are based on historical circumstances that have
					changed and therefore the justifications are no longer valid.
					Also, he is factually incorrect when he asserts that "Most
					codes on ethics in medicine prohibit advertising by doctors."
					Indeed, the British Medical Council, the Australian Medical
					Association, the Canadian Medical Association and the
					American Medical Association Guidelines for Physicians
					permit advertising by physicians. (These are readily available
					on the web).
				</p>
				<p>
					In the West, in the 18th and 19th centuries, many
					practitioners were unlicensed and untrained quacks who
					often derived their incomes from exaggerated claims of
					efficacy of their treatments supported by "testimonials" from
					patients. When organized medicine evolved from guilds into
					professional societies in the late 19th and early 20th century,
					most imposed a ban on advertising of professional services
					as an integral part of professionalism.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the socio-political scene changed, in the United States,
					the American Medical Association's ban on advertising by
					physicians was successfully challenged in the U.S. Supreme
					Court in 1975. The U.S. Supreme Court held that such a
					restriction amounted to limiting freedom of (commercial)
					speech. The AMA subsequently revised its statutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, so long as the advertisement does not contain any
					false or deceptive information, an American physician is
					free to advertise her or himself through any commercial or
					other form of public communication. However, certain
					restrictions still apply. To the extent that testimonials
					regarding a physician's skill or quality of professional
					services from patients who do not have a comprehensive
					access to the physician's practice are often misleading, such
					endorsements are not permitted. Ethical obligations to share
					medical knowledge and skills make it improbable that a
					physician is likely to have unique skills or equipment. An
					advertisement that makes such a claim would be questioned.
					However, such a claim may be justifiable in a restricted
					geographic area. Claims regarding competence and quality
					of care supported by objective data are permissible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about doctors, their qualifications, fees and
					services they provide is of obvious value to the community. The Australian Medical Association's guidelinesunderscore this point:
				</p>
				<p>
					The Australian Medical Association (AMA) believes that
					a doctor's reputation and capacity to increase their practice
					should be based on good medical practice and appropriate
					provision of information about the medical services they
					offer. The AMA believes that all such information should:
					a.be demonstrably true in all respects;
					b. not be misleading, vulgar or sensational;
					c. seek to maintain the decorum and dignity of the profession;
					d. not contain any testimonial or endorsement of clinical skills; e. not claim that one doctor is superior to others nor
					contain endorsements for any particular doctor; and
					f. avoid aggressive forms of competitive persuasion, such
					as those that prevail in commerce and industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>In accordance with the general guidelines detailed above,
					the chief purpose of any advertisement for a doctor's services
					should be to present information that is reasonably needed
					by any patient to make an informed decision about the
					appropriateness and availability of the medical services
					offered.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The ban on advertising and relying strictly on word-ofmouth
					referrals or referrals from other physicians that Dr.
					Pandya advocates has two other implications: (1) It favors
					the already established doctors, "the gray beards", against
					the new entrants to the field of medicine. This bias is entirely
					in keeping with the hierarchical nature of the English society
					that gave us our system of medicine. (2) Allowing other
					doctors to be gatekeepers to consultants has promoted fee
					splitting. A transparent well-publicized schedule of fees and
					services of a consultant may help put a stop to this practice.
				</p>

				<h4>Dr. Malpani's claims in his web site</h4>
				<p>
					A visit to Dr. Malpani's web site indicates that the
					advertisement does violate some of the criteria set forth
					above (i.e. not contain any testimonial or endorsement of
					clinical skills, not contend that one doctor is superior to
					other). Some may argue that Dr. Malpani's offer of shared
					risk amounts to aggressive competitive persuasion.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Consequences of unrestricted commercial
				advertising in India</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Pandya's final point regarding undue exploitation of
					patients has some validity. In India, where there is little
					professional and legal oversight, unscrupulous practitioners
					may abuse the right of free speech. However, the remedy is
					better education not restrictive legislation against
					advertising. "Word of mouth" is also advertising of a kind.
					It is not paid for with money but with services rendered. It is
					often inaccurate and has greater room for hyperbole. Word
					of mouth dissemination of information provides the physician
					with the added loophole that he was misunderstood or he
					never made such claims. One can take a doctor to court for
					false advertising in the print media or on the web. However,
					word of mouth dissemination of exaggerated claims of
					efficacy cannot be litigated easily.
