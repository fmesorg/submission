					Over the past decade, funding for international research in low and middle-income countries has  grown. As research activities have increased, so has the number of  complex questions concerning the social and ethical dimensions of collaborative  research. While the scientific and lay press have begun to take note of  these concerns <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bagla P. New guidelines promise stronger bioethics. Science 2000; 290: 919." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stephens J et al.

Helsinki discord? A controversial declaration. JAMA 2000; 284: 2983." id="3">3)</a>, until recently no platform existed for individuals  from the developing world who are responsible for the ethical conduct of  research in their countries, to engage in dialogue about how these issues might  be approached in their own countries and in international collaborative  research.
				</p>
				<p>
					This report describes the activities of the Second Global Forum on Bioethics in Research <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Loff B. Violence in research. Lancet 2000; 355: 1806." id="4">(4)</a>, the most recent in a series of colloquia designed to examine conceptual and  practical challenges arising from cross-cultural research and to provide  guidance in improving institutional capabilities in bioethics in the developing  world. Working with the US National Institutes of Health, the United  Kingdom's Medical Research Council, the South African Medical Research Council  and other international agencies, the meeting was hosted in Bangkok,  Thailand, in October 2000 by the World Health Organization. At both  the inaugural meeting held in 1999 <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hofman K. The Global Forum Meeting for Bioethics in Research: report of a meeting, November 1999. Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics 2000; 28: 174-175." id="5">(5)</a> and the Bangkok meeting, the predominant  representation was from the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focus of the meeting in Bangkok was on:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Capacity building for ethics review in developing countries,
					</li>
					<li>
						the benefit of the process and products of research to the host country; and
					</li>
					<li>
						the impact of international and national intellectual property rights frameworks.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This report provides  background on these issues and a sense of the discussion in Bangkok.

				<h4>Capacity building for ethical review</h4>
				<p>
					If countries hosting  collaborative research are to be full partners in the research process, it is  crucial that they have their own capacity to conduct a thorough ethical review  of research proposals. This may not be so simple, since the precise  elements that constitute capacity are not clear. Some say that adequate  capacity requires a properly constituted ethics review committee that follows  fair and transparent procedures. For example, the WHO's operational  guidelines for ethics committees that review biomedical research <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO. Operational guidelines for ethics committees that review biomedical research. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization, 2000." id="6">(6)</a> states  that "Ethics Committees should be multidisciplinary and multi-sectorial in  composition, including relevant scientific expertise, balanced age and gender  distribution, and laypersons representing the interests and concerns of the  community." These guidelines go on to specify a series of  requirements for review of applications including assessment of the nature of  community involvement prior to and during research, and the extent to which the  community will benefit as a consequence of the research.
				</p>
				<p>
					A panel discussion at  the Bangkok meeting highlighted some of the shortcomings of improving ethics review  capacity alone. Even within the confines of an ethics committee, serious  ethical debate could be problematic in social and cultural milieu lacking a  tradition of egalitarianism or in an environment in which challenging authority  is unusual. In settings in which unfounded but strongly held  discriminatory presumptions operate with respect to gender, caste or race, it  seems unrealistic to expect that ethical review will redress this. The  self-interest of governments, of researchers and the privileged few who may  become members of these committees might influence the committees'  deliberations and judgements, and without transparency could be difficult to  regulate. Corruption or bias may be blatant or may be manifested in  understandable loyalties to family, clan or region. Committees are not  independent from economic and social pressures. These issues represent a  significant challenge for capacity building in developing countries.
				</p>

				<h4>Benefiting the community</h4>
				<p>
					One common criticism of  the conduct of medical research in developing countries is that those who ought  to benefit as a result of research frequently do not. This is  particularly true of participants in resource-poor settings. The indirect  benefits of research may include provision of training, facilities, building  capacity for independent scientific and ethical review, the creation of  collaborative research opportunities and the recognition of community  contribution in publications and research forums. Beyond the indirect  benefits, however, the obligation to make successful interventions available to  participants, and even more broadly to their communities and populations, is  still hotly debated. However, the principle of reciprocity of benefit  between those performing the studies and those volunteering as participants is  increasingly being accepted as a requirement of ethical research, though there  is no consensus on the appropriate scope of the obligation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Global Forum on  Bioethics in Research in Bangkok contributed to the on-going debate on this  issue by presenting three case studies that illustrated different approaches to  negotiating and providing benefits to the community in three different setting  at three stages in the research process. The cases were subsequently  discussed in small breakout sessions during the meeting. The first case  illustrated an elaborate process of negotiation between industry and the  government of Thailand before initiating research on an AIDS vaccine. The  second case illustrated lengthy negotiations about drug pricing, in this case  medication for river blindness, a product that had been available for many  years for veterinary purposes. A neutral body, in this instance the World  Health Organization, acted as mediator. The final case illustrated the  complexities of prior agreements. The Africa Centre for Population and  Reproductive Health in South Africa presented a video documenting the  difficulties and the detailed negotiations required after the research had  begun because the perceptions and expectations of the community were changed  during the process of participating.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the breakout  sessions, during which small groups examined the merits of each case, a panel  discussion centred on the value of prior agreements to a draft template for  conceptualising and negotiating community benefits in advance of trials.  Some participants expressed concern that such a requirement might delay or  prevent research being carried out in developing countries, and that promising  access to a product at the end of trial can raise the question of undue  inducement. An attempt to provide some guidance on this point is  furnished by recent UNAIDS guidelines on vaccine research <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="UNAIDS, Ethical considerations in HIV preventive vaccine research. Geneva, Switzerland: Joint United Nations Program, 2000." id="7">(7)</a>, which state that  "The research protocol should outline the benefits that persons participating  in HIV preventive vaccine trials should experience as a result of their  participation. Care should be taken so that these are not presented in a  way that unduly influences freedom of choice in participation." It  was acknowledged that discussion is centered on community benefit agreements  during the course of clinical research, and that it might be different  when performing epidemiological, genetic and social sciences research. A  number of related issues were raised including the question of who ought to be  party to the agreement and its prospective enforceability. Further  discussion is still needed to clarify who might bear responsibility for  reviewing benefit-sharing agreements and in particular whether or not an ethics  review committee is an appropriate body to perform this role.
				</p>
				<p>
					The subject of  intellectual property is frequently raised in the context of international  health research and this was also on the agenda in Bangkok. Lamentably,  in this arena ethical discussion seems least developed. There is debate  amongst AIDS treatment activists about compulsory licensing and some writing  about patenting of genetic material.
				</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Capacity building is a  key first step in promoting ethical conduct and all efforts to do so should be  encouraged to continue. These include efforts such as the Forum for  Ethical Review Committees in the Asian and Western Pacific Region that could be  used as a model for other regions, funding by donor governments such as the  grant provided by the Government of Norway to promote collaborative ethics  training between the University of Bergen and Thammasat and Mahidol  Universities in Thailand, as well as the International Bioethics Education and  Career Development Award funded by the Fogarty International Center and National  Institutes of Health in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					There appeared to be  some general agreement that while the value of a template for conceptualising  and negotiating community benefits in advance of trials would be useful, this  cannot be a 'one size fits all' arrangement. Extensive developing country input  is required in the drafting of such a prototype.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the  participants at the Forum hoped that the agenda for the next forum in the  Gambia in 2001 and those that follow would continue to provide a platform where  ongoing and unresolved issues can be openly discussed.
