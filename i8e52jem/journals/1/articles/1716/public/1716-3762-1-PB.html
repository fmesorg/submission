				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Medical ethics require doctors to attend to their patients with sincerity,  honesty, diligence and care. They do not, by any stretch of imagination,  include aiding and abetting the wrongdoer. Of late we are witness to a series  of examples wherein medical doctors stoop to fraud to help prominent, powerful  and rich clients avoid the hardships of imprisonment ordered by the courts of  law. Doctors, especially those professing to be experts on diseases of the  cardiovascular system, have hastened to admit such prisoners to intensive care  units where the latter have rested in air-conditioned comfort not just for a  day or two but for weeks on end. All tests carried out during such prolonged  stays fail to confirm the presence of any serious illness.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  occasion such prisoners have ensured that they do not spend a single day in  prison. Once they obtain bail, the symptoms that prompted admission magically  disappear and they leave the hospital to resume full activity.

					On 17 October 1995, Mr. Rajaram, Secretary of the South Madras unit of the All  India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham was arrested and brought before Justice C.  Shivappa on charges of instigating assault on an advocate. The judge refused to  grant bail as there was every possibility of (the accused) eliminating evidence  with the free use of money and power. On 31 August 1995, Mr. Rajaram had got  himself admitted to the Government General Hospital, Madras, for post- operative complications after he was interrogated by the Central Bureau of  Investigation. On 27 September he got himself discharged against medical  advice, met a politically powerful figure and got himself readmitted to the  General Hospital a few hours later. On 17 October, after he was denied bail by  Justice Shivappa, he got himself discharged from hospital against medical  advice again, travelled on the pillion of a motorcycle and later surrendered to  a magistrate and submitted that he needed urgent medical attention for chest  pain. Mr. Rajaram was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) of the same  hospital from which he had got himself discharged against medical advice, for  unstable anginawhich disallowed him from attending court.

				<h4>The case of Mr. T. T. V. Bhaskaran</h4>
				<p>
					Cardiologists at the General Hospital, Madras, had also helped Mr. Bhaskaran,  Managing Director of J. Jay TV, who was arrested on charges of violating the  Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. Mr. Bhaskaran also happens to be the nephew of  Ms. Sasikala, principal aide to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Mr. Bhaskaran  complained of pain in the chest and was admitted to the General Hospital within  a few hours of being remanded to police custody on 22 September 1995. The  Enforcement Directorate found the alacrity with which the petitioner developed  a heart ailment intriguingand commented that his subsequent conduct raised  doubts about his actual medical condition. The accused was noted to run his own  office from the hospital using a cellular phone. He was in the special ward and  in the intensive care unit of the hospital for almost a month <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: Bhaskaran to be interrogated in hospital.

The Hindu 22 October 1995." id="4">4)</a>. On 29  October, two days after he was granted bail by the court, Mr. Bhaskaran was  reported to have the left the hospital with a spring in his walk. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Subramanian TS: Ducking the law.

					When  Mr. Bhaskaran was advised coronary angiography, he refused permission for this  test. Dr. Brahmanandam, Chief of Cardiology, General Hospital, Madras, when  asked about this, said, <em>'If the patients refuse to undergo an investigation, what could be  done? If Bhaskaran refused to undergo an angiogram, he had the right to do so.'</em> When asked if such a patient can be kept in  the CCU indefinitely, Dr. Brahmanandam replied, <em>'What can be done? I  cannot discharge somebody who is sick either. I have to look after him.'</em> It is of interest that this senior doctor  also stated, <em>'As for my fellow medical professionals, what ethics is there  amongst the medical community?'</em> An un-named cardiologist in Madras who studied these cases  commented, <em>'This is a case where both patients and doctors are cleverly using  legal provisions to their advantage.'</em> <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Subramanian TS: Ducking the law.

				<h4>Union Ministers in office</h4>
				<p>
					Mr. H. K. L. Bhagat was recently arrested in connection with the murders of  several Sikhs in 1984 in the aftermath of the assassination of Mrs. Indira  Gandhi. The manner in which he, his family and lawyers manoevred his immediate  transfer to hospital and ensured that he spent the bare minimum of time in  Tihar jail has prompted public ridicule and has been lampooned by all our major  cartoonists and satirists. (See page 50 of this issue for examples.) His  daughter-in-law, Ms. Rita Bhagat, is reported to have been shocked when he  was briefly sent from hospital to jail. 'How could they have sent him back to  Tihar Jail despite such an aggravated prostate problem? He goes to the urinal  at least 25 times a day,'she said. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: and back to Tihar jail...

					Mr.  Kalpnath Rai also complained of breathlessness and showed a rise in blood  pressure soon after his arrest on 16 February 1996. In this instance, doctors  at the G. B. Pant Hospital decided, after observing his progress over six and a  half hours and carrying out several tests, to send him back to Tihar jail. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: From jail to hospital...

				<h4>The dangers of such abettment</h4>
				<p>
					By his act of felony, the doctor favoring a prisoner sets into operation a  chain of damaging events.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  first and foremost danger - that of crying 'Wolf!' - has already been encountered.  Greatly disturbed by the manner in which rich and powerful prisoners manoeuver  themselves into the comforts of plush hospitals, a judge disallowed  industrialist Rajan Pillai to transfer from Tihar Jail into a hospital. His  physical state worsened in the jail and by the time it was decided to shift him  to hospital, he was in extremis. His death is currently under judicial  investigation. Crying 'Wolf!', then, can prove disastrous to those in genuine  need. The doctor helping a person not in need of medical care by admitting him  to hospital is at least as guilty as the prisoner pretending to be ill.
				</p>
				<p>
					Admitting  a fraudulent public figure to a ward, especially if this be one offering  intensive care, harms genuinely sick patients. The already hard-to-get bed is  blocked by the VIP, depriving the patient who really needs such care. It also  ensures distraction of staff at all levels. Inevitably, they tend to fuss over  the awe-inspiring figure with a relative neglect of the bona fide patients.  With most weighty figures now carrying around them a gang of toughs wielding  potent automatic weapons, the disturbance is complete in a ward where quiet and  efficiency should prevail and where the seriously ill should be the focus of  all attention.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  medical doctor is also to blame as admission of such prisoners to hospital is  made on grounds that only another member of the profession can investigate and  challenge. Where suspicion of malpractice is raised, another senior consultant  in the field must spend time and energy to investigate and report on the  findings. This, in turn, means that the treatment of his own patients must  suffer for this duration. In the case of film star Mr. Sanjay Dutt, admitted to  the intensive cardiac care unit at the Sir J. J. Group of Hospitals whilst in  prison, the judge ordered three senior consultants to investigate the matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fraudulently  admitting a powerful but healthy prisoner to an intensive care ward when so  many other genuinely ill prisoners in that and other prisons are deprived of all  but the most elementary care is yet another kind of travesty of justice. The  last, but not the least, danger is the abasement of the medical profession.  What is one to make of the fact that when a three-member team of the  Enforcement Directorate, armed with an order from the court, went to the  General Hospital, Madras to interrogate Mr. Bhaskaran, they were told by the  Dean and Dr. Brahmanandam, Chief of Cardiology, that they could not interrogate  the prisoner for more than ten minutes. After a few monosyllabic replies were  offered in response to their questions, the officers were made to leave.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such  instances are evidence of the growing tendency in doctors who attend to those  in power to crawl as they pander to their base whims and desires. When, as often  happens, such doctors happen to form the politically powerful segment of the  profession, the danger is heightened as they serve as role models for highly  impressionable and sometimes unthinking youngsters.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  extent of degradation that has already taken place is evident from the fact  that when the Central Bureau of Investigation attempted to put together an  independent panel of specialists to ascertain the real health condition of Mr.  Adhi Rajaram in Madras, they ran into a wall of polite refusals from some of  the premier medical institutions of Tamil Nadu. Similar refusals in Mr.  Bhaskaran's case led Dr. S. Ramadoss, founder of the PMK, to exclaim against  the lack of medical ethics that permitted the 'staging of such a drama'; and  demand a Central Government medical team to examine Mr. Bhaskaran. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: Bhaskaran to be interrogated in hospital.

				<h4>An obvious solution, overlooked on purpose?</h4>
				<p>
					Why don't the rich and  famous - and doctors who are quick to rush to their help - work for the  creation of facilities for medical services of the highest quality in our major  prisons ? Such facilities would ensure that there is never a repetition of the  Rajan Pillai episode.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  would also ensure that the genuinely ill in prisons, unfortunate in that they  lack monetary or political clout, will also get the medical attention they  deserve. Since the prisoner, deprived of most of his rights by a court of law,  is not allowed to choose his doctor and hospital, it is all the more important  that he is provided medical care of the highest quality.
