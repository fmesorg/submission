					I  remember feeling sleepy while holding retractors during long operations during  residency in Mumbai and later in the USA in the early 1990s. The Accreditation  Council for Graduate Medical Education in the USA recently implemented strict  regulations that would prohibit residents working more than 80 hours per week  and more than 24 hours at a stretch. Recently, a prestigious internal medicine  residency programme at Johns Hopkins Medical School lost its accreditation for  violating this rule. The proposed regulations argue that house staff fatigue is  responsible for physician error, ill-health and lack of compassion for  patients. Critics point to how these affect the goals of house staff  training&mdash;the development of accountability and responsibility. The terms 'house  staff' and 'resident' were coined based on the fact that residents are always  on duty and available for care of the patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar  regulations were introduced in New York State in 1987 after a young woman,  Libby Zion, died while on medical service. The Bell Commission concluded that  the on-call resident's sleep deprivation and inadequate supervision by her  attending physician contributed to the tragic outcome. A more recent report  from the Institute of Medicine concluded that many deaths in hospitals are due  to medical error. Most studies find that the prevention of error in hospitals,  factories, cockpits, etc., is far more effective when systems rather than  individuals are the focus of corrective measures. However, at a time when  evidence-based medicine is being preached, it is still not proven that limiting  duty hours reduces physician error.

					Hospital  medicine is an intense '24/7' experience in the USA. The pace of activity  barely slows down during the evening in teaching hospitals. Doctors face  constant pressure, driven by current health care economics, to reduce the  length of the patient's stay by tightly scheduling diagnostic procedures and  therapeutic interventions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  duration of medical training can be as long as 12 years with long working  hours, relatively low pay and great physical, emotional and intellectual  demands. Medical education and patient care are inextricably interwoven and  take place at the bedside. Both patients and residents have the same anxieties  and uncertainties, now compounded by a flood of web-based information and new  technological data gathering. Shift work makes patients 'to do' items on the  resident's list. It breaks down the narrative flow of a patient's illness. The  reason why medicine is taught at the bedside in the Oslerian manner is to  understand the difference between disease and illness. Atul Gawande has stated  that the 'culture of medical education...entails a delicate balance between  initiative and supervision'. Doctors will master the science but may not  understand the human being.

				<h4>Solutions</h4>
				<p>
					Three things seem certain. The limitation on duty hours will not go away;  indeed, it may become more stringent. We have to devise strategies that will  reconcile the tradition of high-quality, science-based medical care with  satisfying the needs of both patients and physicians. We need to closely  examine the apparent 'disconnect' between medical education and medical care.  We need to come up with innovative and effective approaches to reconcile these  competing needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical  educators must debate the timing or necessity of limiting duty hours. Is there  a difference between work and duty? Is a house officer a trainee or worker?  There are possible solutions already in effect in some pro-grammes. Many  training programmes have instituted 'night float teams' and other variations of  a shift system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information  technology is a two-edged sword. Patients are unsettled by computer-generated  summaries, by shunting between day teams and night teams who defer important  diagnostic studies or treatment, duplicate them, or worse, commit errors as a  result. Lack of communication is the single most common complaint patients have  about their physicians. I worry that duty hours would worsen this as the key  component of medical education-the acquisition of large scientific information  and development of accountability and responsibility&mdash;would be affected. As H L  Mencken wrote, 'For every complex problem there is simple solution. And it is  always wrong.'
