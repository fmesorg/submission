				<h4>Dr. Daniel Callahan</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Daniel Callahan, President and co-founder of the Hastings Center will  retire as president in the summer of 1996 (Hastings Center Report 1995; 25:  45). He conceived the idea of forming a center for bioethics in 1968. Together  with his neighbour, Willard Gaylin, and the foggiest of notions on how they  should go about the task, they got the Center off the ground in 1969. The rest,  as the phrase goes, is history.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Callahan has served the Center as chief executive officer  for twenty-six years, managing it, finding funds for it and directing its  research and educational programs. In the process he has also written or edited  twenty-five books.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Callahan offered the following explanation: <em>'I speculate  about the moral meaning of the life cycle and now I should live some of those  ideas. There comes a time when every founder of an organisation should step  aside to make room for the next generation of leadership. I decided a0 few  years ago that once we passed the twenty-five year mark, my time would come. I  have had a spendid and interesting journey. Good talk, good colleagues, good  supporters, good issues: what more could a philosopher ask of life?'</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'But to retire from a role is not to retire from life. I  will remain at the Center, happily expending and expanding my energies on that  which I have liked the most over the years - my research and writing. Two  questions will preoccupy me, both at the international level: What kind of  medicine will be best for society ? What kind of society will be best for  medicine? Immoderate questions, to be sure, but those are the kind I like. They  will keep me busy.'</em>
