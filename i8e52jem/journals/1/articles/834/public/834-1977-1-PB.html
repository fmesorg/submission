					The Supreme Court  petition <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WP (C) 334/2001 with WP (C) 562/2001)" id="1">(1)</a> by the voluntary organisation <em>Saarthak</em> has triggered off a debate  on the treatment of persons with mental disorders in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the requests made  in the petition are: to issue directives banning direct (unmodified) ECT and  establishing a process for sanctioning modified ECT without informed consent;  to strike down, as unconstitutional, section 81 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The World Health Report 2001. Mental health : New Understanding, New Hope. WHO. Geneva. 2001" id="2">(2)</a> of the Mental Health Act,  1987 (MHA, 1987) which permits research on persons with mental disorders; to  direct states to comply with section 4 of the Act which requires the setting up  of state mental health authorities to regulate mental health care; to regulate  the use of physical restraints and limit their use to extreme cases; to  guarantee proper sanitary facilities to institutionalised persons; to ensure  that institutions provide facilities for rehabilitation; to set up a mechanism  to protect the rights of institutionalised people; to ensure that essential  drugs are made available at all institutions, and to set up a scheme for legal  assistance for patients in exercising their right of discharge under section 43  of the MHA, 1987.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, the  debate has focused entirely on the issue of ECT. For the uninitiated, direct  ECT is the administration of ECT without general anaesthesia, while modified  ECT is the administration of ECT with general anaesthesia and muscle relaxants.  This debate is a non-starter: it is accepted the world over that ECT must be  administered in a modified form. It has been argued that there is a special  case for permitting direct ECT in India because of the lack of facilities for  anaesthesia, and to reduce the costs of treatment. Both these arguments are  spurious. ECT is a major procedure and must be carried out under reasonably  safe medical conditions.
				</p>

				<h4>An assault on clinical autonomy?</h4>
				<p>
					Three demands in the  petition have raised the hackles of the psychiatric community: to establish a  procedure for administering ECT without consent, for a ban on research on  medical research on patients with mental disorders, and for regulating the use  of restraints. These have been perceived as an assault on clinical autonomy.  One may argue that the procedures suggested in the <em>Saarthak</em> PIL are difficult  to implement in Indian conditions. However, it is difficult to argue against  the principle of regulation of involuntary treatment and of the use of  restraints.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other points in the  petition, such as the provision of rehabilitation facilities in all  institutions, have attracted little attention, though they are probably the  most important and can have far-reaching effects on the quality of life of  persons with mental disorders.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The real issues in mental health</h4>
				<p>
					Almost everyone agrees  that the most important issue in the field of mental health is the lack of  access to high quality care for a majority of the population. Treatment, when  available, is based on a purely medical model focusing on the provision of  drugs and ECT. There is a dearth of psycho-social therapies, counselling and  psycho-therapy services and rehabilitation facilities. It is well accepted that  mental health care needs to be multi-disciplinary, involving professionals such  as psychologists, psychiatric nurses and psychiatric social workers. However,  such care is limited to a few centres in our country.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mental disorders account  for nearly 15 per cent of health-related disability but most countries,  including India, devote less than 1 per cent of the total health budget to  mental health services. Mental health services are labour intensive and human  resources make up a significant proportion of the costs. However, there is an  acute scarcity of adequately trained mental health professionals in the  country. This is unlikely to change in the near future given the shortage of  training facilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most countries have  between two and three times as many psychologists, social workers and  psychiatric nurses as psychiatrists. In India, it is estimated that there are  more psychiatrists in active clinical practice than there are trained  psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists and psychiatric social workers. No  systematic efforts are being made to address this distortion, by professional  organisations or by the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For mental health care  to become accessible within existing resource constraints, it must be provided  through primary health services. This approach has many advantages. Clinical  outcomes of primary care for most common and acute mental disorders are as good  as in specialised psychiatric services, if not better <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The World Health Report 2001. Mental health : New Understanding, New Hope. WHO. Geneva. 2001" id="2">(2)</a>. Primary health  services are less stigmatising than psychiatric services, and there is also a  lower risk of human rights violations. They are geographically closer to the  user, increasing the likelihood that people seek help early in the illness.  Finally, mental health care through primary health services is less expensive (and  more cost-effective) both for service providers and recipients.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, primary health  care professionals will have to be trained to detect and treat mental  disorders. It is unreasonable to expect already overburdened staff in the  state-run primary health system to take on more labour- and time-intensive  interventions. It may be necessary to increase the number of general staff if a  mental health care component is to be added. Other issues that need addressing  include supervision of primary health care staff, adequate infrastructure and  equipment and, most important, the availability of psychotropic medication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Internationally, there  is a movement away from providing institution-based care. This change will not  take place in India unless alternatives are put in place including  rehabilitation facilities, long-stay homes in the community and community  psychiatric services. The primary health care-based community mental health  programme in India covers only 22 districts with a population coverage of 40 million,  which is less than five per cent of India's population.

				<h4>A public health approach needed</h4>
				<p>
					Mental health treatment  and care must be integrated within and outside the health services. In health  care, it needs to be integrated into the various levels of health care. There  are also opportunities for integration into vertical health programmes. For  example, a programme to tackle post-partum depression (which affects 25-30 per  cent of mothers in the first year after delivery), can be integrated into the RCH  programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside health care,  mental health services must work in collaboration with agencies dealing with  housing, employment, social welfare and the criminal justice system. They can  also be integrated into social programmes; for example, a programme to tackle  depression among women can be integrated into programmes addressing domestic  violence. Finally, integration demands collaboration between the government  medical sector, private providers, NGOs and traditional health providers. There  are good examples of NGO participation in the provision of good quality mental  health care in India; these need to be replicated across the country <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patel, V. and Thara, R. (editors) Meeting Mental Health Needs in Developing Countries: NGO innovations in India. Sage India, in press." id="3">(3)</a>.

				<h4>Protection of human rights</h4>
				<p>
					The National Human  Rights Commission's inquiry into the functioning of mental hospitals in India  documents serious human rights abuses in many mental institutions across the  country <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Quality assurance in mental health. New Delhi. 1999" id="4">(4)</a>. International standards such as the UN Principles for the  Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental  Health Care <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Principles for the protection of persons with mental illness and for the improvement of mental health care. UNGA resolution 46/119 of December 17, 1991." id="5">(5)</a>, though not legally binding, represent an international  consensus on standards of good practice. International human rights covenants  provide legally enforceable protection of human rights in signatory states. For  example, Article 7 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by UN General Assembly Resolution 2200A (XXI) of December 16, 1966." id="6">(6)</a>,  to which India is a signatory, provides all individuals, including those with  mental disorders, protection from torture, cruel or inhuman or degrading  treatment or punishment and the right not to be subjected to medical or  scientific experimentation without informed consent. The <em>Saarthak</em> PIL asks for  implementation of many of these internationally agreed standards and covenants.
				</p>

				<h4>The role of legislation</h4>
				<p>
					Mental health  legislation has an important role to play in the protection of human rights.  Mental disorders sometimes affect people's decision-making capacities and they  may not always seek or accept treatment for their problems. Rarely, persons  with mental disorders may pose a risk to themselves and others due to impaired  decision-making abilities. Most important, persons with mental disorders face  stigma, discrimination and marginalisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Legislation must strike  a fine balance between the individual's rights to liberty and dignity, and  society's need for protection. It must address issues such as integration into  the community, access to high quality care,and protecting the rights of persons  with mental disorders, including in areas such as employment, education and  housing.
				</p>
				<p>
					From this perspective,  MHA 1987, is woefully inadequate as it focuses entirely on the provision of  treatment in what it calls psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric nursing homes.  The chapter dealing with human rights contains only one section on research on  persons with mental disorders. There is little understanding of the need to  protect the rights of persons with mental disorders when treatment is  administered without their consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>Saarthak</em> petition  mentions only involuntary ECT. Many would argue that it does not go far enough.  In most countries, an independent authority (not the family) on a  psychiatrist's recommendation must sanction and supervise involuntary treatment  of all kinds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mental health  legislation in many countries also gives persons under involuntary treatment  the right to review. Under the MHA 1987, the State Mental Health Authority is  charged with this supervisory function. But as mentioned in the <em>Saarthak</em> petition, such bodies have not yet been established by many states.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>Saarthak</em> petition  has to be viewed in the broader context of provision of mental health care in  India. The petition and the consequent debate presents an opportunity to discuss  the (lack of) provision of mental health care, and related human rights issues.  This opportunity should not be lost by limiting the debate to ECT.
