							Clinical trials are defined as studies involving human participants,
							with the intervention being selected by the investigator <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Laine C, Horton R, DeAngelis CD, Drazen JM, Frizelle FA, Godlee F, Haug C, Hebert PC, Kotzin S, Marusic A, Sahni P, Schroeder TV, Sox HC, Van der Weyden MB, Verheugt FW. Clinical trial registration - Looking back and moving ahead. N Engl J Med. 2009 Jun 28; 356(26): 2734-6." id="1">(1)</a>.
							The intervention can be related to a new drug or device, or a new
							indication for an already approved drug or device. The intervention can
							also relate to different healthcare options, eg the trial may be aimed
							at comparing the management of a particular illness in the hospital to
							its management in the community.
						</p>
						<p>
							The state regulatory body for drugs in Sri Lanka is
							the Cosmetics Drugs and Devices Regulatory Authority (CDDRA). The
							CDDRA's permission is required for the registration and import of new
							drugs. In January 2009, the ministry of health appointed a subcommittee
							on clinical trials (SCOCT) under the CDDRA. The SCOCT's regulatory
							approval is necessary for clinical trials. The SCOCT requires ethical
							approval by a recognised ethics review committee (ERC). Further,
							according to the regulations, registration in the primary World Health
							Organization clinical trial registry network is mandatory. The clinical
							trial registry, which is in the premises of the Sri Lanka Medical
							Association, is the only such registry in the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently, bureaucrats in the health and the finance
							ministries, as well as a few academics, have been pushing for a new Act
							on clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Justice, Sri Lanka. The Clinical Trials Bill, 2012. Legal Draftsman's Department, Ministry of Justice, Sri Lanka; 2012." id="2">(2)</a>.
							This paper highlights the various loopholes in this draft Act and
							describes how it may give the pharmaceutical companies opportunities to
							circumvent its provisions and exploit patients. The clinical trial
							industry has been perceived by these Faustian treasury economists as a
							magnet for foreign currency. The draft Act reflects an insouciant
							attitude to the patient's welfare and the free health system, which is
							unique to Sri Lanka. There were no consultations with the public or the
							stakeholders when this Act was drafted, and its provisions have still
							not been made known to academics, ERCs and the public.
						</p>
						<p>
							The supposed aim of the Act is to regulate clinical
							trials in Sri Lanka, since the country lacks a legal framework to
							regularise clinical research. It is expected to cover the legal
							loopholes that arise during all phases of the conduct of clinical
							trials in drugs and devices. As in the USA, this Act will protect
							contract research organisations (CROs) and clinicians from law suits in
							case of an injury to a participant <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Elliott C. Justice for injured research subjects. N Engl J Med. 2012 Jul 5; 367(1): 6-8." id="3">(3)</a>.
							Injuries such as multi-organ failure when injected with a biological
							agent (anti-CD28 antibody) in a highly publicised phase one randomised
							clinical trial (RCT) make it imperative to discuss mechanisms of
							compensating and treating research injury <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Suntharalingam G, Perry MR, Ward S, Brett SJ, Castello-Cortes A, Brunner MD, Panoskaltsis N. Cytokine storm in a phase 1 trial of the anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody TGN1412. N Engl J Med. 2006 Sep 7; 355(10):1018-28." id="4">(4)</a>.
							Although the draft Act claims to follow the International Conference on
							Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines, there is
							ample evidence to show that even the ICH-GCP was formulated to
							safeguard the pharmaceutical industry <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abraham, J. Drug trials and evidence bases in international regulatory context. BioSocieties. 2007 Mar;2(1):41-56." id="5">(5)</a>.

						<p>
							The authors managed to get a copy of this draft Act forwarded by the
							attorney general's department to the secretary of the ministry of
							health. A copy was also sent to the attorney general for the issuance
							of a certificate of constitutionality. This is a common practice to
							verify whether an act is in harmony with the law of the land or
							constitution. The draft Act has a Preamble and 38 Articles. Its main
							objective is to establish the regulatory framework for randomised
							controlled trials (RCTs) and to facilitate the process of obtaining the
							licence and approvals required to conduct them. The other objectives
							are to ensure the implementation of the WHO's good clinical practice
							(GCP) guidelines, register all RCTs, support and protect study
							participants, provide accreditation and register CROs. Articles 3-6
							relate to the policy and regulatory framework, while Articles 7-9 deal
							with ERCs. Articles 10-20 pertain to the licence for conducting
							clinical trials. Article 21 deals with the conduct of clinical trials
							and the payment of compensation. Informed consent is described in
							detail in Article 22. Articles 23, 25 and 26discuss the
							responsibilities of the licence-holderand Article 27is about adverse
							events. Article 24 discusses the conduct of clinical trials in
							emergency situations. Article 28 relates to amendments to the protocol,
							and Articles 29, 31 and 32 give details of responsibilities of sponsors
							and investigators. Article 33 describes offences and sets forth the
							pecuniary penalties, specifying the minimum and maximum limits.
							Article34describes the powers of the health minister, while Article 35
							mentions regulations that should be included in the gazette. Articles
							36, 37, and 38 deal with procedural aspects of the Act.
						</p>
						<p>
							After the new Act is passed, the national policy on
							clinical trials will be drafted and reviewed every three years. The Act
							will be enforced mainly by the Clinical Trials Regulatory Division
							(CTRD), a new entity to be established under the CDDRA in the ministry
							of health (Article4). The CDDRA has a history of scandals <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madurawala S. Corruption risks in the provision of pharmaceutical drugs in Sri Lanka. Talking Economics blog. Colombo: Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka; 2010 Mar 4 [cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from:  http://www.ips.lk/talkingeconomics/2010/03/corruption-risks-in-the-provision-of-pharmaceutical-drugs-in-sri-lanka/" id="6">(6)</a>, the most recent one being related to an irregularity in a tender for  surgical gloves <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Perera S. Bribery probe into awarding gloves tender to unregistered supplier [Internet]. The Island Online.2012 Sep 15[cited 2013 Sep 3]. Available from: http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=61642" id="7">(7)</a>.
							There is a belief that the CDDRA is under the influence of or being
							pressurised by Big Pharma
							(<a href="http://lankacnews.com/sinhala/main-news/45178/" target="_blanl">http://lankacnews.com/sinhala/main-news/45178/</a>). Thus, it is likely that the CTRD will also be influenced by the pharmaceutical companies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Paragraph 7 of Article 4 of the draft Act specifies
							that the CTRD will receive independent funding. However, there is no
							explanation regarding who will authorise payment from that fund and who
							or what organisations can give donations and grants to the fund. There
							is not a single sentence about the management of the fund. This gives
							an opportunity to various foundations that represent the corporate
							social responsibility face of Big Pharma to manipulate the CTRD.
						</p>
						<p>
							The draft Act requires the establishment of a
							regulatory review committee (RRC), which will include three
							pharmacologists and three clinicians, among others. The chairman of the
							RRC, who will be elected during the first meeting, need not be from the
							ministry of health or CTRD (Article 5, paragraph 3). If an influential
							clinician is elected as chairman, he/she will be able to manipulate the
							proceedings because of the enormous power that clinicians wield in
							developing countries such as Sri Lanka. Also, four clinicians have been
							co-opted as non-voting members to advise the committee. All of them are
							required to declare any conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis
							(Article 5, paragraph 6). This may lead to further abuse as clinicians
							who have earlier been subtly involved with pharmaceutical companies can
							influence decisions. Sri Lanka has no law regulating the
							physician-industry relationship and no law on the transparency of such
							interactions. In a recent newspaper article, it was alleged that a
							medical consultant is paid as much as Rs 150,000 for recruiting a
							patient for a clinical trial.
						</p>
						<p>
							The same medical consultants do their "rounds" in
							ethics committees, clinical trials registries and hospitals conducting
							RCTs, and are sometimes handsomely paid according to the number of
							patients they recruit for RCTs. Their collusion enables the conduct of
							RCTs at cheaper cost, in less demanding legal settings, and with less
							resistance from a less informed public <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Karunanayake P. The banal face of medical research [Internet].The Nation.2012 Jan 22. [cited 2013 Jan 16].  Available from;  http://www.nation.lk/edition/component/k2/item/1730-the-banal-face-of-medical-research" id="8">(8)</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							A 12-member panel of experts has been appointed on the recommendation
							of the CDDRA to review applications for clinical trials (Article 6). If
							necessary, an expert may be consulted for his opinion (Article 6,
							paragraph 2). The expert has to give his feedback within 14 days of the
							receipt of the application. In the case of major disagreements, another
							expert has to review the application. The provisions are
							unsatisfactory, considering the review standards maintained by
							journals, funding agencies and ERCs, which deem that a minimum of two
							experts is mandatory. Also, the 14-day time limit is too short.
						</p>
						<p>
							Article 7 of the draft Act discusses the
							accreditation of the ERCs. However, there is no mechanism for appeal if
							accreditation is denied. Currently, the ERCs of the major universities
							and professional organisations have a central body -the Forum of Ethics
							Review Committees, Sri Lanka (FERCSL) -which is under the patronage of
							the Sri Lanka Medical Association. Two ERCs in the FERCSL have received
							recognition from the Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in
							Ethical Review (SIDCER) through the Forum for Ethics Review Committees
							in Asia Pacific (FERCAP). Although the draft Act discusses the
							accreditation of ERCs and their standards, such as those related to
							ongoing monitoring of clinical trials, it does not mention the issue of
							increasing the capacity of the ERCs. ERCs do not have separate funding,
							secretarial or support staff, office equipment or stationery. They
							depend on the goodwill of the heads of the academic departments of
							universities to carry out their work. They are unable to monitor
							approved research due to lack of resources. Article 8 discusses the
							responsibilities of the ERCs, including site visits, if necessary
							(Article 8, paragraph 4). Presently, no site visits are being
							undertaken by ERCs in Sri Lanka due to lack of funding. Also, the Act
							devolves the responsibility of safeguarding the rights and ensuring the
							safety and well-being of trial subjects on investigators. In Article
							21, the onus of dealing with research-related injury is placed on the
							investigator and the institution conducting the trial. The Article
							specifically requests the investigator to enter into an agreement with
							the sponsor of the trial about insurance and indemnity. Instances when
							compensation should not be paid are specified here. For example, the
							clause relating to the natural progression of the disease provides the
							sponsors of trials with an escape mechanism, helping them to avoid
							paying compensation (Article 21,paragraph 11). The draft Act proposes
							the establishment of an arbitration committee under the CDDRA to
							resolve disputes between the sponsor and the investigator about the
							compensation for trial-related injury.
						</p>
						<p>
							The draft Act has other serious drawbacks as well.
							All the drug trials are not covered by it or by the CTRD.
							Non-commercial drug trials conducted by academic or healthcare
							institutions, collaborative groups and individuals, and cooperative
							establishments are not under its purview. This would make it possible
							for pharmaceutical companies to use proxy organisations to conduct
							research. Investigator initiated clinical trials, academic multicentre
							trials investigating non-drug therapies, exploration of drug therapies
							for neglected tropical diseases, and investigation of already
							established complementary and alternative medicines need to be
							encouraged. Increased paperwork and a complex procedure of regulatory
							review, together with additional administrative hurdles, are likely to
							further discourage local academic researchers <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lang TA, Siribaddana SH. Clinical trials have gone global: Is this a good thing? PLoS Med. 2012;9(6):e1001228. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001228" id="9">(9)</a>.
							The wealthier foreign trial sponsors have the capacity and resources to
							produce the necessary paperwork that can clear the bureaucratic
							hurdles.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another drawback is that pharmaceutical companies
							can apply to the CTRD and ERC simultaneously. If this draft Act is
							serious about protecting patients' rights, approval from the ERC should
							be a prerequisite for applying to the CTRD. The applicant can influence
							the ERC on the strength of the fact that he has obtained approval from
							the CTRD.
						</p>
						<p>
							The draft Act is full of clauses and exclusions
							that can be used by multinational pharmaceuticals companies which have
							abundant resources, including their teams of lawyers, ethicists and
							researchers, to circumvent the Act's provisions and exploit patients.
							As in the case of India, "mere guidelines will not suffice" and the
							need for stronger legal oversight cannot be overemphasised <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Laine C, Horton R, DeAngelis CD, Drazen JM, Frizelle FA, Godlee F, Haug C, Hebert PC, Kotzin S, Marusic A, Sahni P, Schroeder TV, Sox HC, Van der Weyden MB, Verheugt FW. Clinical trial registration - Looking back and moving ahead.N Engl J Med. 2009 Jun 28; 356(26): 2734-6." id="1">(1)</a>.
							The fact that the provisions of the draft Act have not been made known
							to everyone, lobbying by the economists who are regulating the monetary
							policy in Sri Lanka and the lack of transparency, which is reflected in
							the absence of debate and discussion in open forums, have caused
							concern. The draft should be available in the public domain and a
							mechanism of transparency should be put in place to solicit the views
							of all stakeholders, encourage debate and aid the process of reaching a
							consensus. A sufficient amount of time should be devoted to the
							implementation of these steps as there is no urgent need to rush the
							legislation. Meanwhile, the ERCs can be strengthened by injecting more
							resources into them and enhancing the capacity of their members. The
							FERCSL should be encouraged to expand its role of providing guidance
							and increase its efforts in the sphere of capacity-building. It is
							important to distinguish between clinical trials initiated by local
							investigators, those initiated by Big Pharma and those by foreign
							academics and institutions, and the same set of guidelines should not
							be used to regulate all of them <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Franzen SRP, Chandler C, Enquselassie, Siribaddana S, Atashili J, Angus B, Lang T. Understanding the investigators: a qualitative study investigating the barriers and enablers to the implementation of local investigator-initiated clinical trials in Ethiopia. BMJ open. (under review)" id="10">(10)</a>.
							There are other intricacies, too, that need to be taken care of. These
							include local investigator-initiated trials that test new food
							products, complementary and alternative medicine therapies and
							biotechnological products, which need to be evaluated separately. The
							approval of some such trials may need to be expedited, considering
							their importance to the national economy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Meanwhile, the absence of any law is the preferable
							option till the ERCs have the capacity to stand alone confidently. As
							the new Act seems to have assigned the ERCs a pivotal role in the
							regulation of RCTs, it is essential to enhance the capacity of their
							members and expand the infrastructural support available to them before
							the draft Act sees the light of day. In the short to medium term, it
							seems that RCTs can be monitored well enough by the existing channels,
							such as the ERCs, Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry, the approval
							process of the CDDRA, the country's vigilant media and the outspoken,
							whistle-blowing academics. In the long term, ensuring transparency and
							full consultations with the public might reduce exploitation, but this
							is not a foolproof option. Increasing the science, health and research
							literacy of ordinary people, in addition to improving their living
							standards and reducing poverty would be the best method of preventing
							the exploitation of poor patients by the "clinical trials industry".
