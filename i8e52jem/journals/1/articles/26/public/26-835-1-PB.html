				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					While risks are inherent in a clinical trial, the human research
					subject can be exposed to various types of harm that lie
					beyond ethically and morally acceptable parameters. The
					protection of trial subjects in the clinical trial process is the
					task of an institutional ethics committee (IEC). In India, any
					agency conducting biomedical research using human subjects
					is required by law to seek approval of its research protocol
					from an ethics committee before a clinical trial begins, under
					Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945, amended
					2005 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Schedule Y, The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 (as amended upto 30th June, 2005). New Delhi:CDSCO;2005 Jun 30[cited 2013 Jun 15].

					The need for establishing protective measures for human
					subjects in medical research was first codified in 1947 in
					the Nuremburg Code- a 10-point code of ethics in medical
					research that stressed the autonomy of the trial subject,
					the imperative of voluntary informed consent and the
					responsibility of physician-investigators towards the rights of
					the subject (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Nuremberg Code. JAMA.1996 Nov;276(20):1691." id="3">3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shuster E. The Nuremberg Code: Hippocratic ethics and human rights. Lancet.1998 Mar;351(9107):974-77." id="4">4</a>). In the 1960s and 1970s, the idea of an ethics
					review of clinical research - over and above the responsibility
					of individual investigators towards trial subjects - gathered
					momentum in the West, particularly in the United States
					(US) <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Levine RJ. Ethics and regulation of clinical research. New Haven,Connecticut: Yale University Press; 1988." id="5">(5)</a>. Investigations into state funded trials in the US that
					revealed the unethical use of prisoners, racial minorities,
					children and the mentally challenged as trial subjects led to
					the establishment of the National Research Act in 1974. The Act
					stated the need for review boards to assess the ethical conduct
					of medical research (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beecher HK. Ethics and clinical research.

Beneficial and unusual punishment: an argument in support of prisoner participation in clinical trials. Indiana Law Review. 2009 Feb;33(2):475-515." id="8"> 8</a>). International awareness of unethical
					human experimentation also led to the establishment of other
					ethical guidelines such as the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki that introduced - in its 1975 revision - the need for an independent
					ethics review of clinical research (<a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Levine RJ. Ethics and regulation of clinical research.

The Declaration of Helsinki and public health. Bulletin WHO. 2008 Aug;86(8):650-651." id="9">9</a>). Ethical guidelines of the
					Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences
					(CIOMS), concerned primarily with the ethical conduct of
					clinical trials in the developing world, also stated guidelines for
					ethics committees <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences.

					An IEC comprises individuals with both medical scientific
					and non-medical/non-scientific backgrounds. Schedule Y of
					India's Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, as amended - the
					main statute for clinical trial operations and ethical oversight
					- requires IECs to have "at least one member whose primary
					area of interest/specialization is non-scientific and at least
					one member who is independent of the institution/trial site"
					<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Schedule Y, The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 (as amended upto 30th June, 2005). New Delhi:CDSCO;2005 Jun 30[cited 2013 Jun 15]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/D&C_Rules_Schedule_Y.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. This multidisciplinary foundation of the IEC rests on the
					understanding that an ethics review must be guided by diverse
					viewpoints so that there is an all-encompassing assessment
					of moral dilemmas that may arise before, during, and after
					a clinical trial. All members must endeavour to share the
					researcher's burden in seeking a balance between the pursuit
					of scientific interests on the one hand and the needs of society
					and the rights of research subjects on the other <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Levine RJ. Ethics and regulation of clinical research. New Haven,Connecticut: Yale University Press; 1988." id="5">(5)</a>. The ethical
					review process must be free from institutional bias. IECs are,
					therefore, required to select a chairperson who is unaffiliated
					to the institution so that decisions made are objective and
					independent of the interests of investigators and institutions.
					In addition to the chairperson, the IEC is required to have
					a member secretary who is an employee of the institution
					and who is responsible for the administrative tasks of the
					committee <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human participants. New Delhi:ICMR;2006 Oct[cited 2013 Jun 15]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/ethical_guidelines.pdf" id="11">(11)</a>.

					An ethics committee must follow prescribed procedures
					- enumerated in the ethical guidelines for biomedical
					research on human subjects of the ICMR and the Drugs and
					Cosmetics Rules - to ensure and sustain both the scientific
					and ethical integrity of a research protocol. According to
					ICMR, "It is advisable to have separate committees for each
					[kind of protocol review], taking care that the scientific
					review precedes the scrutiny for ethical issues" <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human participants. New Delhi:ICMR;2006 Oct[cited 2013 Jun 15]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/ethical_guidelines.pdf" id="11">(11</a>: p 8). A
					scientific review involves an assessment of the technical
					value of the proposed clinical trial, its scientific design and
					the research methodology. An ethical review is concerned
					with the equitable selection of research subjects, of ensuring
					a fair distribution of risks and benefits across populations,
					examining informed consent documents and verifying the
					process by which informed consent is obtained. An ethics review must also evaluate the appropriateness of monetary
					compensation offered to trial subjects for their participation,
					assess the relevance of the intervention to trial subjects and
					the community at large, review the provision of standard
					of care, ensure compensation by sponsors for trial-related
					injuries and examine the mechanisms by which post-trial
					access to beneficial treatment can be a possibility. In addition
					to initial ethical review, ethics committees are also responsible
					for the continued review of approved research that could
					involve assessing progress reports provided by investigators
					as well as visiting trial sites <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Schedule Y, The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 (as amended upto 30th June, 2005). New Delhi:CDSCO;2005 Jun 30[cited 2013 Jun 15]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/D&C_Rules_Schedule_Y.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Implicit in the responsibilities of an ethics committee is the
					commitment to three fundamental ethical principles: respect
					for persons, beneficence and justice. The task of informed
					consent, for instance, conforms to the principle of respecting an
					individual's autonomy in deciding - without coercion or undue
					influence - whether or not to participate in a clinical trial. When
					applying the principle of beneficence, the IEC must review if
					the protocol has made all attempts to maximise the benefits
					and minimise the risks for trial subjects and establish that the
					risks they face are reasonable in relation to the benefits. To
					ensure justice in research, also defined as distributive justice
					particularly in the context of the developing world, an IEC
					would have to safeguard against certain kinds of individuals
					or groups being consistently selected for medical experiments
					because of their easy accessibility and social, economic or
					other vulnerabilities. In other words, trial subjects should not
					be disproportionately limited to those who are unlikely to have
					the means to enjoy the beneficial outcomes of research <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Levine RJ.

					Across the world, research conducted on the performance of
					ethics committees has revealed inadequacies in the structural
					and functional aspects of these ethical review bodies <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Allen P, Waters WE. Attitudes to research ethical committees.

What do IRBs look like? What kind of support do they receive? Account Res. 2002 Jul-Dec; 9 (3-4):199-216." id="13">13</a>).
					For example, in 1981, a survey was undertaken in Wessex, in
					the UK, of individual ethics committee members and other
					members of the medical profession, to understand their
					perceptions about the role of ethics committees. The survey's
					findings included polarized views among medical members
					regarding the role of non-medical members. On the one hand
					the role of lay ethics committee members were perceived
					by medical members as "purely window-dressing exercises
					serving little or no useful function" <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Allen P, Waters WE. Attitudes to research ethical committees. J Med Ethics. 1983 Jun;9(2):61-5." id="12">(12:</a> p 64), and on the other,
					non-medical members were perceived as having an important
					role to play as they provide a balanced view of the research <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Allen P, Waters WE. Attitudes to research ethical committees. J Med Ethics. 1983 Jun;9(2):61-5." id="12">(12)</a>. In1995, in the US, Raymond G De Vries from the Centre
					of Bioethics, University of Minnesota and Carl P Forsberg from
					Boston College in Massachusetts, surveyed a random sample
					of 89, of the 892 IECs registered with the Office of Human
					Research Protection. The survey attempted to look into the
					"black box" <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="De Vries RG, Forsberg CP. What do IRBs look like? What kind of support do they receive? Account Res. 2002 Jul-Dec; 9 (3-4):199-216." id="13">(13:</a> p 200) of IECs so that reform in the systems of
					human subject protection could be initiated. The study found
					that membership of the IECs leaned towards whites, medical
					researchers and those connected with the institution. The
					study also raised the issue of the lack of administrative support
					for IECs that resulted in insufficient review and monitoring of
					trials. Among the key conclusions of this study was that "public
					failures of science are not the simple result of evil scientists driven by greed or blind ambition. Rather they are a product of
					structural problems in the system of review created to protect
					human subjects" <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="De Vries RG, Forsberg CP. What do IRBs look like? What kind of support do they receive? Account Res. 2002 Jul-Dec; 9 (3-4):199-216." id="13">(13:</a> p 213).

					In India too, ethics committees have come under increasing
					criticism for functioning as "secret societies unaccountable to
					the public" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A. Ethics in ethics committees: time to share experiences, discuss challenges and do a better job. Indian J Med Ethics. 2009 Apr-Jun;6(2):62-3." id="1">(1:</a> p 63). Yet, little effort has been made to undertake
					qualitative research on the ethical review bodies. Members of
					the committees are not willing to talk about the challenges they
					face, leaving little room for any discussion to facilitate a more
					streamlined and effective ethical review process <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A. Ethics in ethics committees: time to share experiences, discuss challenges and do a better job. Indian J Med Ethics. 2009 Apr-Jun;6(2):62-3." id="1">(1)</a>. Research
					conducted on IECs in the country is limited to a handful of
					surveys. For instance, in the year 2002, ICMR conducted a
					World Health Organization (WHO)-sponsored survey of IECs
					associated with clinical trials or research projects funded by the
					ICMR. One of the survey's objectives was to understand lapses
					in ethical review mechanisms in organisations conducting
					biomedical research. The ICMR intended to conduct its survey
					on 149 ICMR-supported clinical trials or research projects
					across 71 institutions. However, only 36 institutions responded
					to ICMR. While all 36 institutions claimed to have IECs, only 23
					had a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place; only 14 had
					trained their members in bioethics, and there was no response
					from more than half the committees about their status on
					training. The survey also found that of the 149 projects, IEC
					clearance certificates were available for only 107 projects <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A.

					Unit of the National AIDS Research Institute, in the city of Pune,
					in Maharashtra, on the profile and role of members of ethics
					committees in hospitals and research organisations in Pune. 52

					In the context of limited information on ethics committees in
					the country, disclosures by the media of unethical trials and
					an increasingly global environment of clinical trial operations
					in India, the study: 'The role of institutional ethics committees
					in clinical trials: a study of selected hospitals in New Delhi', was
					conducted in 2010-2011 for a degree at the Centre of Social
					Medicine and Community Health at the Jawaharlal Nehru
					University, in New Delhi. This paper describes the essential
					findings of the research that attempted to provide an insight
					into the structure and function of IECs. Moreover, the study
					also examined the kinds of challenges faced by IECs that pose
					barriers to IEC performance and thus jeopardise a just and
					effective system of protection for the human trial subject.
					Generalisations of the entire population of IECs in the city of
					Delhi, however, cannot be made on the basis of this research
					that represents only the views and experiences of specific IEC

				<h4>The context</h4>
				<p>
					Today, over 60% of the global pharmaceutical market share
					belongs to the drug industry operating in the US that includes
					both European and American drug companies <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. When experiments travel: clinical trials and the global search for human subjects. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2009." id="7">(7)</a>. By the early 1990s, clinical trial operations of these pharmaceutical
					firms had expanded to non-traditional research locations
					such as Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. When experiments travel: clinical trials and the global search for human subjects. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2009." id="7">(7)</a>. High
					infrastructure costs in the developed world and a shortage of
					willing research subjects were among the main reasons cited
					for the globalisation of clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. Ethical variability: drug development and globalizing clinical trials. Amer Ethnologist. 2005 May; 32(2):183-197." id="18">(18</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thiers FA, Sinskey AJ, Berndt ER. Trends in the globalisation of clinical trials. Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2008 Jan;7(1):13-14." id="19">19</a>). Moreover, the
					"treatment saturated" US population, consuming many more
					drugs than it used to, was rendered unsuitable for participating
					in clinical trials. The industry therefore needed "treatment
					narve" populations or those who were not taking drugs at the
					time of a clinical trial, as interactions of different types of drugs
					can interfere with research outcomes <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. Ethical variability: drug development and globalizing clinical trials. Amer Ethnologist. 2005 May; 32(2):183-197." id="18">(18</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sunder Rajan K. Experimental values: Indian clinical trials and surplus health. New Left Review. 2007 May-Jun;(45):67-88." id="20">20</a>). India and China
					have emerged as attractive options for clinical trial operations
					in recent years. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
					figures from 2006 on the number of clinical trial investigators
					enrolled with the agency show that Russia had 623, the
					largest number of investigators, followed by India with 464
					investigators <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. When experiments travel: clinical trials and the global search for human subjects. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2009." id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The expansion of clinical trial operations in India was largely
					facilitated by an amendment to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules
					in 2005. The amendment allowed foreign drug companies to
					conduct clinical trials in the country concurrently with other
					trials being run outside India. Before the liberalisation of the
					country's drug development laws, clinical trials for new drugs
					of foreign origin were permitted only if a later phase of the trial
					had already been conducted in a foreign country. For example,
					Phase II trials - conducted primarily to establish efficacy of an
					intervention in patients - could be conducted in the country
					only on the condition that the confirmatory phase or Phase III
					trials had taken place elsewhere earlier <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nundy S, Gulhati CM. A new colonialism? - Conducting clinical trials in India. New England J Med. 2005 Apr;352(16):1633-6." id="21">(21)</a>. These regulations
					were important safeguards that prevented the country's
					population from being treated as first-line trial subjects. With
					the 2005 amendment, the nature and scope of clinical trials
					in India was considerably altered. Data analysed from India's
					clinical trial registry indicates an increase in the number of trials
					since 2005 and the strong and increased presence of the drug
					industry in clinical trial sponsorship. Before 2006 there were 29
					pharmaceutical sponsors of clinical trials in India compared to
					350 in the year 2009 <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran D, Nikarge S. Clinical trials watch. Indian J Med Ethics. 2010 Oct-Dec;7(4):259-62." id="22">(22)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is little information in the public domain on reasons why
					people participate in clinical trials or the breakdown of trial
					subject populations by caste, class and gender. From media
					reports on ethical violations of clinical trials, we know that trial
					subjects are largely India's poor, vulnerable and unsuspecting
					populations who are induced into trials by promises of free
					treatment, monetary incentives and an implicit faith in their
					doctor's judgment <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nundy S, Gulhati CM. A new colonialism? - Conducting clinical trials in India. New England J Med. 2005 Apr;352(16):1633-6." id="21">(21)</a>. For example, journalist Jennifer
					Kahn describes the physician of a hospital in Sevagram, in
					Maharashtra, as "uneasy about his clinical success" because,
					according to the doctor, "Nine out of 10 times...the patient
					will just ask me to make the decision about the trial for him" <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kahn J. A nation of guinea pigs. Wired [Internet]. 2006 March 14 [cited 2013 Jun 3]. Available from: http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14-03/indiadrug.html" id="23">(23:</a> p 3). The asymmetry inherent in every doctor-patient
					relationship is further exacerbated by India's healthcare system.
					According to Rao et al, 71% of spending on health is out-ofpocket
					and this expenditure pushes 4% of India's population
					into poverty every year <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao M, Rao KD, Shiva Kumar AK, Chatterjee M, Sundararaman T. Human resources for health in India. Lancet. 2011 Feb;(377):587-98." id="24">(24)</a>. With healthcare expenses being one of the leading causes of poverty in India, clinical trials hold
					the promise of healthcare for many patients, and perhaps even
					a cure. At the hospital in Sevagram, the sponsor of a stroke
					prevention trial promised trial subjects two free physical
					examinations in a year during the course of the trial <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kahn J. A nation of guinea pigs. Wired [Internet]. 2006 March 14 [cited 2013 Jun 3]. Available from: http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14-03/indiadrug.html" id="23">(23)</a>. Even
					if a drug does prove beneficial to a patient in a trial, it is most
					likely that the trial subject will not be able to afford the drug
					after the trial is over. The doctor at the Sevagram hospital gave
					the example of a trial conducted to test an anti-clotting drug,
					at a cost of Rs 800 a day that would not be affordable to his
					patients <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kahn J. A nation of guinea pigs. Wired [Internet]. 2006 March 14 [cited 2013 Jun 3]. Available from: http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14-03/indiadrug.html" id="23">(23)</a>. Moreover, media coverage of doctors covertly
					accepting monetary payments to recruit patients for trials
					stand testimony to unscrupulous practices adopted by the
					medical community in conducting clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagarajan R.

					The emergence of a clinical trial industry in India has thus

					confront in an ethical review.

				<h4>Research methods</h4>
				<p>
					Seventeen IEC members were individually interviewed
					across five hospitals located in New Delhi. Since there is
					no centralised registry of IECs or a systematic means of
					identifying medical institutions that have ethics committees,
					the selection of hospitals was purposive or based on the
					researchers' judgment of which institutions would be the
					most appropriate to the study's aims. Of the five hospitals, two
					were public institutions; two were private hospitals and one a
					trust-managed hospital. Differently-run medical institutions
					were selected in an attempt to observe differences and
					similarities, if any, in the respective IECs.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the exception of one IEC, the researcher made initial
					contact with the member secretaries or secretariats of the
					ethics committees. These individuals were identified either
					through the hospital's website or via the researcher's personal
					contacts. Details of other IEC members were provided by the
					member secretary, through the institution's website or with the
					help of personal contacts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The synopsis and research tools of the study were approved
					by the ethics committee constituted by the Centre of Social
					Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University
					(JNU). Before the interview, all interviewees were informed in
					writing by the researcher and the research supervisor about the
					objectives of the study. All interviews were conducted by the
					student researcher at the interviewee's place of work, with the
					exception of three members. The identities of all interviewees
					and their institutions were kept confidential by the researcher.
					The interviews conducted were semi-structured and divided
					into two broad themes: the operational and functional aspects
					of the IECs, and the opinions and views of IEC members on a
					range of topics such as member appointments, ethics training,
					workload and other challenges faced by IEC members.
					Additionally, findings of this study are also based on the nonparticipant
					observation of an IEC meeting at one of the private
					hospitals, where the researcher was a silent observer at the meeting. An IEC meeting was observed to primarily understand
					the nature of deliberations of such a meeting, the IEC intergroup
					dynamics and the nature of interaction between the IEC
					and investigators, who were invited to present their protocols.
					Additionally, three SOPs that were made available to the
					researcher by the respective IECs were examined to assess
					whether these ethics committees had articulated their terms of
					reference for members and if the institution had an established
					policy on the IEC selection process. An interview with the
					manager of a private hospital's department of clinical research
					was also conducted in order to understand the department's
					role in functioning as the IECs secretariat. All interviews were
					recorded in writing as answers to questions based on the
					interview guide. Individual interviews were transcribed on
					the basis of responses to the interview guide and grouped
					according to institution. The findings were then organized by
					the researcher into different themes based on the interview
					guide and also examined for similarities and differences in
					the workings of the IECs. The themes used are not mutually
					exclusive of each other and each topic must be read in relation
					to the others.

				<h4>Findings</h4>

					<h5>Arbitrariness in member selection</h5>

				<p>
					The non-affiliated members - or those external to the
					institution - interviewed for this study were selected to
					their respective IECs by a seemingly arbitrary process based
					on an informal network of contacts and affiliations. Across
					hospitals, there appears to be no written policy on member
					selection. Instead, non-affiliated members are appointed to
					the IEC through word-of-mouth referrals in order to fulfil the
					requirement of forming a multidisciplinary team. For example, a
					non-affiliated, non-medical/non-scientist member from the IEC
					of a public hospital was unsure of the reasons why the hospital
					approached him for IEC membership. "They must have heard
					about me," the member stated. A non-affiliated, non-medical/
					non-scientist member of a private hospital was appointed to
					the institution's IEC because of an informal recommendation by
					his cardiac surgeon who is a practising doctor at the hospital.
					According to an affiliated member from a private hospital, the
					hospital "found out who the experts are in the industry." In
					some cases, the non-affiliated, medical members had a former
					association with the concerned hospital. Thus, doctors from
					both within and outside the hospital - who constitute about
					half the IEC - can frequently have an institutional affiliation.
				</p>
				<p>
					For affiliated doctors, membership on an IEC was a burden and
					an additional responsibility to their already busy schedules. "I
					did not have a choice," said one doctor and another contended
					that he "was not asked" if he "would like to become a member"
					or if he "was willing." From the majority of responses of nonaffiliated
					and non-medical/non-scientist members, it was not
					clear whether they joined the IEC because of individual career
					prospects or to fulfil an obligation. "It is a big honour to be a
					part of an elite group of doctors," stated a non-affiliated/nonmedical
					member. The response of only one non-affiliated and non-medical/non-scientist member implied reflection on
					the need of an IEC in the context of the global clinical trial.
					The member expressed the importance of having a "working
					position" on transnational corporations because "they are here
					and you have to deal with them" as his reason for joining an
					ethics committee.
				</p>

					<h5>Lack of training on the ethics of clinical research</h5>
				<p>While the majority of IEC members interviewed for this
					study emphasised the importance of ethics training, only
					members from private hospitals had undergone any form
					of training. A non-affiliated, non-medical/non-scientist
					member from a private hospital's IEC found the training
					to be "very useful." On the other hand, a non-affiliated,
					non-medical/non-scientist member on the IEC of a public
					hospital expressed the difficulties faced by new IEC
					members due to the lack of training: "in the first two to
					three meetings we are like dumb people. But we are not
					showpieces," the member stated. While untrained members
					are a concern, the member secretary of a public hospital's
					IEC pointed out that organising training programmes is
					difficult due to the busy schedules of doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					An affiliated member of a public hospital's IEC implied that
					doctors do not require "intensive training" as "they are already
					sensitised" to patient issues. The member however stated the
					importance of developing discerning clinicians so that they can
					read between the lines of drug company-sponsored research
					protocols that "could be hiding information and not revealing
					everything." Another doctor on the IEC of a private hospital was
					also of the opinion that ethics training was not such a necessity
					for doctors on the committee because these individuals
					"are well aware of the role of ethics in clinical research," the
					member said. While admitting that "sometimes clinicians may
					not see things from a layman's perspective" and "there can be
					oversight which is not intentional," this member "takes ethics
					for granted."
				</p>
				<h5>Ethical dilemmas</h5>
				<p>
					Ethical dilemmas are not only inherent to clinical research
					but are also the reason why an independent ethics review
					is imperative. However, it is evident that there is a dearth
					of debate and discussion on weighty ethical questions. For
					example, a medical member who favoured the use of control
					groups in an experiment was of the opinion that the IEC is in
					fact a "big hurdle" to conducting scientific experiments because
					"we need more controls (groups)...statistical evaluation is
					not up to the mark. This is the constant dilemma." Thus, the
					scientific design of a clinical trial such as a randomised control
					trial-in which patients that are randomly assigned to the
					placebo arm of the trial will be denied treatment-can in itself
					raise ethically complex questions, especially when effective
					treatment exists. It is in these difficult situations that in fact the
					role of the multidisciplinary IEC must come into play to arrive at
					morally acceptable solutions that do not endanger the safety
					of trial subjects.
				</p>
				<h5>Challenges faced by the non-affiliated, non-medical/non-scientist
					member</h5>
				<p>
					The findings of this study indicated that while on paper IECs
					are multidisciplinary bodies, in spirit the intention of diversity
					in ethical review is not apparent in either private or public
					institutions. The medical/scientist members on the IEC are the
					most assertive voices in ethics committee deliberations. There
					is little room for the non-medical/non-scientist members to
					express an opinion, and their presence on an IEC appears to be
					merely obligatory. Barriers to the effective participation of nonmedical/
					non-scientist members include the inherent hierarchy
					that exists between the medical expert and the non-medical
					expert, as well as the highly technical nature of clinical trial
					protocols.
				</p>
				<p>
					A non-affiliated, non-medical/non-scientist member describes
					her experience at IEC meetings of a public hospital:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						We can't ask the doctors. Doctors are not conducive; they
						assert their knowledge of medical technology... It is a
						closed circle; they [the doctors] don't open up. At times I
						feel I am not doing justice. Three of us are from outside. We
						don't usually say anything. You have to be well studied if
						you say anything.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					A non-affiliated, non-medical/non-scientist member of a
					private hospital's IEC described the inability of investigators in
					adapting protocols for an ethics review thus:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Although there is a separate technical committee, for an
						ethics committee they [the investigators] present the same
						information. It's a huge amount of literature and none of it
						makes sense. Nothing in the proposal says what the ethical
						issues are. There is no effort to make it easier.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					While voices of non-medical/non-scientist members are not
					adequately represented in IEC meetings, a social scientist
					member from the IEC of a private hospital also stated, "that it
					is easier in a way for unaffiliated members to make a point"
					than for a clinician affiliated to the institution. Non-affiliated
					members, he explained, have less at stake in raising an
					objection than affiliated members, whose disapproval could
					offend both the institution and the investigator, who might
					possibly be a colleague of the doctors on the IEC.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, even when non-affiliated, non-medical/nonscientist
					members have the confidence to voice an opinion,
					there is very little they can do to impact the ethics of the clinical
					trial process. For example, an outside member raised a question
					in an IEC meeting about the objectivity of the appraisal process
					by which it was declared that the death of a research subject
					was unconnected to the trial. The member was informed that
					an expert committee had reviewed the matter and reached this
					conclusion. However, the member learnt that the expert team
					had comprised doctors who were affiliated to the institution.
				</p>
				<h5>Institutional bias in ethical review</h5>
				<p>
					The likelihood that affiliated IEC members will prioritise
					institutional interests over the safety of the research subject was evident during the deliberations of an IEC meeting of a
					private, super-specialty hospital where trial investigators -
					with institutional affiliation - were presenting their research
					protocols. In response to an investigator proposing the use of
					a placebo arm in the clinical trial, an affiliated member of the
					IEC advised the investigator to practice caution in his use of a
					placebo as an established treatment was known. The medical
					member expressed concern on placebo use in a hospital where
					patients "are paying for everything-in public hospitals it is
					different" and therefore the institution must "protect" itself
					in case the patient holds it responsible for any trial-related
					injuries. The reasons cited by the IEC member for reconsidering
					the use of a placebo did not express the moral dilemma that
					using a placebo raises, but rather indicated a concern for
					providing the hospital protection from any liability. In this
					instance, safety of the trial subject was only a byproduct of the
					hospital safeguarding the institution's legal accountability.
				</p>
				<h5>Workload</h5>
				<p>
					The findings of this study indicated a significant difference in
					the number of protocols reviewed per meeting in the IECs of
					public hospitals compared to private hospitals. For example,
					a public hospital that meets once a month reviews about 50
					protocols per meeting compared to a private hospital that
					also meets once a month but reviews two to six protocols
					in a meeting. The IEC of this particular public hospital also
					undertakes the scientific review of the protocol in addition
					to the ethical review. This adds an additional burden to the
					workload. An affiliated member of this IEC stated that its
					members "had a debate about the scientific review being
					separate. Some of us think it should be separate but there
					are clinicians in the group so it continues to be combined".
					According to an affiliated member, the three to four hour-long
					meetings of this public hospital's IEC are still not enough to
					include the review of amendments made to older protocols.
				</p>
				<h5>Lack of administrative support</h5>
				<p>
					The work pressure experienced by an IEC of a public hospital
					is heightened by the lack of administrative support for the
					committee from the hospital. The IEC's member secretary, who
					also chairs a hospital department, has to rely on the services
					of an assistant assigned to the department to keep minutes
					of IEC meetings and for other administrative tasks of the IEC.
					A major administrative challenge for the IEC "is filing and how
					well you can retrieve documents. These are important if an
					ethics committee has to function properly," stated the member
					secretary. While another public hospital's IEC does have
					dedicated office space, the support staff is limited to only one
					clerical position. "That is all I have," complained the member
					secretary who needs a "full-fledged office and different levels
					of clerical staff to set the agenda, set dates for the meeting and
					look at the proposals."
				</p>
				<p>
					The IECs of private hospitals appeared to have more
					institutional support than the public hospitals. For example,
					one of the private hospitals has a clinical research department
					that is dedicated to the management of its IEC.
				</p>
				<h5>Inadequate monitoring of ongoing clinical trials</h5>
				<p>
					None of the five IECs in this study had been visiting clinical
					trial sites. The shortage of manpower and already overworked
					ethics committees were the reasons given for the lack of onsite
					review. All the IECs thus solely rely on the investigator
					to provide them with progress reports, reports on serious
					adverse events and information on protocol amendments.
					While the member secretary of an IEC expressed that random
					checks of trial sites was very important, she was of the opinion
					that monitoring should ideally be done by a third party. The
					member secretary of another IEC was also of the opinion that
					a third party should be responsible for visiting the clinical trial
					site, unless a member on the IEC was specifically assigned
					the task of on-site monitoring. An affiliated IEC member of a
					private hospital was of the opinion that the responsibility of
					monitoring a trial's progress must lie with the sponsors and
					investigators.
				</p>
				<p>
					While reporting the progress of a clinical trial to the IEC is the
					mandate of investigators and/or sponsors, the objectivity of
					an ongoing review is questionable if it is left to individuals
					who are not entirely independent of the research <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation. Schedule Y, The Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 (as amended upto 30th June, 2005). New Delhi:CDSCO;2005 Jun 30[cited 2013 Jun 15]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/D&C_Rules_Schedule_Y.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. In fact,
					the member secretary of a public hospital's IEC expressed
					difficulties in negotiating with drug companies because of their
					evasiveness in providing an accurate picture of adverse events.
					"Information on adverse events is the main issue," the member
					secretary stated, "but the sponsors try to make it seem not so
					serious."
				</p>
				<h5>The influential presence of the drug industry in the clinical trial
					process</h5>
				<p>
					Dealings with the pharmaceutical industry presented a
					challenge for some IEC members. The member secretary of a
					public hospital's IEC expressed how pharmaceutical companies
					try to get things done their way and attempt to manipulate
					the clinical trial agreement drawn-up among the sponsor, the
					investigator and the institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					The member secretary also expressed concern about the
					public health relevance of the drugs being tested in industrysponsored
					clinical trials in India. "They [drug firms] are making
					India a dumping ground.... studying drugs of all types that we
					don't use", he remarked.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another member-from the IEC of a public hospital-while
					agreeing with the member secretary's concern regarding the
					global pharmaceutical industry's disregard for India's public
					health needs, justified the industry's clinical research priorities.
					He argued that foreign sponsors should not be responsible for
					public health in India when the state itself had failed to deliver
					healthcare to the majority of its people.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						But why should a pharma company do malaria drug
						trials? They are commercial, looking for profit. It's the
						government's responsibility, world over governments are
						giving up their role of social responsibility so why should a
						pharma company care?
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					"Of course then one can say that physicians should not do
					trials of diseases that are not relevant", stated this member,
					who further explained the reason why physician-investigators
					are willing to participate in trials that may not necessarily be
					relevant to India's disease burden:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						For a doctor's career, for promotional aspects it is
						important to be published in an international journal...
						these won't be publishing on malaria unless it is a path
						breaking study but 80-90 percent of studies are not.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					A social scientist member on a private hospital's IEC stated that
					his time on an ethics committee had given him an insight into
					the pressure that the industry imposes on investigators:"It is
					apparent that this is corporate driven research. Ethical issues
					are commercial considerations...I sensed the pressure that
					researchers are under."
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Historically, medical experimentation has exploited human
					vulnerability and targeted the most disadvantaged and
					impoverished sections of society for research purposes (<a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beecher HK. Ethics and clinical research. N Engl J of Med. 1966 Jun;274(24):367-72." id="6">6</a>, <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baader G, Lederer SE, Low M, Schmaltz F, Schwerin AV. Pathways to human experimentation, 1933-1945: Germany, Japan, and the United States. Osiris. 2005;20(2):205-31." id="26">26</a>). Presently, what has changed is not the desperation of the
					trial subject or the risks and uncertainties inherent in drug
					development, but the very structure and scope of the clinical
					trial. The clinical trial enterprise today is built on the foundation
					of a global business model driven largely by drug companies.
					It transcends national boundaries and can involve multiple
					trial sites using thousands of trial subjects across the world.
					"Treatment saturated" populations of the developed world
					are not ideal candidates for clinical trials and neither are they
					easily available in adequate numbers to provide data for a drug
					to pass the marketability test. Increasingly, it is the clinical trial
					industry in developing countries such as India that is meeting
					the demand of transnational pharmaceutical companies for
					running clinical trials and recruiting trial subjects as quickly as
					possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clinical trials being conducted in India do not necessarily offer
					any direct benefit to trial subjects nor cater to the health needs
					of the country. Only 10% of research on drugs is focused on
					conditions that comprise 90% of the global disease burden
					<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petryna A. When experiments travel: clinical trials and the global search for human subjects. Princeton: Princeton University Press; 2009." id="7">(7</a>). An analysis done by Clinical Trials Watch of trials that
					were registered on India's clinical trial registry found that
					in the month of June 2010, for example, only 16 of the total
					1078 registered trials (1.48%) were on lower respiratory tract
					infections and only seven of 1078 (0.6%) were on tuberculosis,
					with 13.4% of trials dedicated to cancer research <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran D, Ingle G. Clinical trials in India: the needs of the country and the focus of sponsors. Paper presented at: Third National Bioethics Conference; 2010 Nov 17-20; New Delhi." id="27">(27)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The IEC in India, thus operates in a competitive business
					environment in which responsibility to the trial subject and the
					community at large can often be lost in the individual interests
					of different groups. The safety of trial subjects is further
					jeopardised if IEC members are not adequately equipped to
					confront ethically complex situations and if they are deprived
					of a supportive environment in which they must carry out
					their role. The findings of this study indicate that IECs face
					many challenges that need urgent consideration and reform.
					The lack of transparency in appointing members, limited
					training opportunities, the invasion of institutional interests in
					an ethical review, inadequate continuing review and the nonparticipatory
					presence of non-medical members are among
					the structural and functional deficiencies of IECs found across
					both private and public hospitals. Some of these issues are
					discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Institutions need to place greater emphasis on ethics training
					for all their IEC members. The SOP of every ethics committee
					must specify the nature and extent of training to be provided
					and also clearly state its definition of ethical expertise. Training
					programmes should sensitise medical professionals to the role
					of non-medical members, who must become equal partners
					in the ethical review process. A collaborative approach to the
					understanding of ethics must be attempted by educational
					initiatives in order to bridge the current divide within the
					IEC that vitiates its overall goal of protecting the trial subject.
					Globally, research conducted specifically on non-medical
					IEC members has also revealed the dominating presence of
					medical members in IEC meetings. For example, Sengupta and
					Lo in their study on non-medical/non-scientist IEC members
					in the US, found that 88% of the non-medical/non-scientist
					participants had negative experiences with their scientist
					colleagues <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sengupta S, Lo B. The roles and experiences of nonaffiliated and nonscientist members of Institutional Review Boards. Acad Med. 2003 Feb;78(2):212-18." id="28">(28)</a>. A US Government report issued in 1998 by
					the Office of the Inspector General stated that the tendency
					to limit an ethics review to technical inputs could negatively
					impact ethical deliberations. Investigators who would rather
					focus on the scientific outcomes of the trial may choose to
					disregard issues such as trial-related risks and the equitable
					selection of subjects. Effective participation of non-medical
					IEC members who can counteract the tendency to neglect
					the ethical components of a research protocol is thus integral
					to the review process. Based on their study, Sengupta and Lo
					recommended a mentoring programme for newly appointed
					IEC members that would require them to work closely with
					more experienced members on the committee while reviewing
					protocols <a class="reference" href="#twentyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sengupta S, Lo B. The roles and experiences of nonaffiliated and nonscientist members of Institutional Review Boards. Acad Med. 2003 Feb;78(2):212-18." id="28">(28)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even so, an educated and cohesive IEC alone will not
					strengthen an ethical review process unless its members are
					selected with transparency and the ethical decisions they
					make are independent of institutional interests. There is
					limited guidance for institutions in ensuring an appointment
					process that is bias-free and representative of the interests
					of trial subjects <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="De Vries RG, Forsberg CP. What do IRBs look like? What kind of support do they receive? Account Res. 2002 Jul-Dec; 9 (3-4):199-216." id="13">(13)</a>. For instance, research in the US on IECs
					indicates that institutions face practical impediments in
					identifying individuals who have both the time and necessary
					qualifications to attend ethics committee meetings <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. Institutional review boards: their role in reviewing approved research. Boston: The Office of Evaluation and Inspections; 1998 Jun. Report No.:OEI-01-97-00190. Available from: https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-97-00190.pdf" id="14">(14</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anderson EE. A qualitative study of non-affiliated, non-scientist institutional review board members. Account Res. 2006 Jun;13(2):135-55." id="29">29</a>).
					Institutions may therefore use the easier option of selecting
					members who are amenable to the rest of the committee
					<a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anderson EE. A qualitative study of non-affiliated, non-scientist institutional review board members. Account Res. 2006 Jun;13(2):135-55." id="29">(29)</a>. The findings of this study indicate that IEC members are
					either employees of institutions or are likely to have a personal
					affiliation. Investigators of clinical trials in many cases also
					belong to institutions where the trial is being conducted.
					For these individuals, clinical trials represent the progress of
					scientific knowledge as well as a means of advancing their own
					personal careers. The nature of IEC composition could thus lend itself to institutional bias and undermine the autonomy of
					the ethical review process, a concern that was evident from the
					findings of this study. A discussion at an IEC meeting on the use
					of placebo when a known treatment existed primarily centred
					on the need to protect the institution from liability charges. For
					another IEC, distancing a trial subject's death from the trial was
					a decision exclusive to doctors associated with the concerned
					institution. Additionally, a non-affiliated, non-medical member
					observed that members like him-who are distanced from
					the institution-have less at stake if they challenged ethically
					problematic issues of a protocol. The crucial policy questions
					on IEC composition that therefore arise are: should all IEC
					members be unaffiliated to the institution to ensure an
					unbiased protocol review? Should the IEC be an autonomous,
					public-funded body that is not dependent on institutional
					support?
				</p>
				<p>
					An untrained, unsupported and overworked IEC bound by
					obligations to the institution and the investigator stands
					powerless in the face of the global clinical trial enterprise.
					Such an IEC will be unable to do justice to an ethics review
					and neither will it be able to carry out its additional role of
					on-site monitoring of trials. Without a supervisory mechanism
					in place that is independent of research, in all likelihood, a
					breach in protocol by investigators will remain unnoticed, or
					serious violations will become public knowledge only after the
					unethical practice has occurred. Should a third party monitor
					clinical trials as some IEC members of this study suggested?
					Or would another review body only add to the bureaucracy of
					the clinical trial process and further distance trial subjects from
					the people who are entrusted to protect their interests? These
					are critical questions that need the attention of the country's
					regulatory authorities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fixing the fundamental systemic issues that interfere with an
					IEC's daily operations and affect the quality of an ethics review
					needs immediate remedy if the IEC has to fulfil its responsibility
					towards the trial subject. Nonetheless, the dilemma remains-
					are we expecting too much from a group of individuals whose
					autonomy in an ethics review is questionable in the face of
					institutional interests and the formidable global framework of
					the clinical trial industry?
