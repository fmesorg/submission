					Well-maintained medical records will unquestionably
					help doctors and hospitals in their defence in cases of
					medical negligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Md. Aslam v. Ideal Nursing Home <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Orissa SCDRC 1994 (1) CPR 619." id="1">(1)</a>, the State
					Commission made a strong note of the lack of regulations
					governing nursing homes and made suggestions regarding
					medical record-keeping. In Poona Medical Foundation
					Ruby Hall Clinic v. Marutirao L. Titkare
					<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="NCDRC 1995 (1) CPJ 232: 1995 (1) CPR 661 (NCDRC) 1996 CCJ 70." id="2">(2)</a>, the National
					Commission held that not providing medical records did
					not constitute negligence or deficiency in service, as there
					was no legal duty cast to furnish such documents to a
					patient. It further held that no material was placed before
					the Commission to show that either by law, or by
					convention or by practice, was there any obligation on
					the part of the hospital to furnish to the patient full
					particulars of the surgical operation performed on him.
				</p>
				<p>
					In January 1996, the Bombay High Court <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Raghunath G. Raheja v. Maharastra Medical Council (198 Bom AIR 1996)." id="3">(3)</a> held that
					doctors and hospitals should make medical records
					available to patients or their near relatives on demand,
					after levying an appropriate fee. It further held that
					doctors and hospitals could not claim any secrecy or
					confidentiality in the matter of copies of the case papers
					relating to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct,
					Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002
					<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="In Section 1.3 Subsections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2." id="4">(4)</a> states that
					every physician shall maintain the medical records
					pertaining to his/her indoor patients for a period of
					three years from the date of commencement of the
					treatment. If any request is made for medical records
					either by the patients/authorised attendant or legal
					authorities involved, the documents shall be issued
					within a period of 72 hours and refusal to do so would
					be misconduct.
				</p>
				<p>
					In many countries, the doctors or hospitals that ask for
					the tests are the owners of the X-ray films and other
					investigational and case records. A patient can get a copy
					of it only when he/she is referred to another doctor or
					decides to file a suit against the doctor/hospital. In the
					UK to overcome the doctors' concern and to maintain
					patients' confidentiality the following Acts are in force.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the Data Protection Act, 1984, an individual
					should be informed by anyone holding computerised
					information whether that information includes his/her
					personal data and should be supplied with copies of it. The
					Access to Medical Reports Act, 1988 states that insurers
					and employers may not be shown a report until the patient
					has seen and commented on it and has consented to its
					disclosure. According to the Access to Health Records Act,
					1990 patients have access to their health records.
				</p>
				<p>
					Manipulated medical records, failure to deliver X-ray films
					and statement of accounts of a hospital, and improperly
					maintained medical records were considered deficient
					services by the Consumer Disputes Redressal Agencies.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In Nihal Kaur v. Director, PGI, Chandigarh <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="1996 (3) CPJ 112 (Chandigarh (U.T.) CDRC)." id="5">(5)</a>, the
						State Commission held negligence on the basis of the
						records, which seemed to be manipulated.
					</li>
					<li>
						In V P Shanta v. Cosmopolitan Hospitals (P) Ltd <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="1997 (1) CPR 377 (Kerala SCDRC)." id="6">(6)</a>,
						the State Commission held that failure to deliver
						X-ray films is deficient service. The patient and his
						attendants were deprived of their right to be informed
						of the nature of injury sustained.
					</li>
					<li>
						In Force v. M Ganeswara Rao <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="1998 (3) CPR 251; 1998 (1) CPJ 413 (AP SCDRC)." id="7">(7)</a>, the State Commission
						held that there was negligence as the case sheet did not
						contain a proper history, history of prior treatment and
						investigations, and even the consent papers were missing.
					</li>
					<li>
						In Dr C Venkatasamy, Director, Aravind Eye Hospital
						v. N Mariappan,
						<a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tamil Nadu State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in order R.P.No.15/1998 dated 18/10/2002." id="8">(8)</a> the hospital rendered free treatment
						to a patient in an eye camp and claimed that he did
						not come under the Consumer Protection Act. When
						the complainant petitioned for summoning the
						statement of accounts, the hospital refused to part with
						it and filed a Revision Petition.
