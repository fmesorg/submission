				<h4>Farewell to arms</h4>
				<p>
					On June 1, 2007, Reed Elsevier, owner of The Lancet, announced its decision to exit the defence exhibitions sector. Its chief executive officer said: "...it has become increasingly clear that growing numbers of important customers and authors have very real concerns about our involvement in the defence exhibitions business... this has led us to conclude that the defence shows are no longer compatible with Reed Elsevier's position as a leading publisher of scientific, medical, legal, and business content."
				</p>
				<p>
					The decision was welcomed by the editors of The Lancet who had been part of the campaign opposing the company's stake in the arms business.

				<h4>Ova for donation or sale?</h4>
				<p>
					The British government has approved a plan to allow women to donate eggs for research and be compensated. Women getting fertility treatments will receive a discount if they donate eggs for research. Others will receive money to cover costs such as travel or lost work time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some researchers argue that patients are often paid for medical experiments. Others worry that poor women will be exploited, donating eggs just for money. Authorities have been accused of downplaying the health risks.

				<h4>Phase 1 trials and the precautionary principle</h4>
				<p>
					The first trials of new drugs in humans should be planned much more carefully, recommends a report by a working party of the Royal Statistical Society, UK. The report was prompted by the TGN1412 drug trial in 2006 in which six healthy volunteers experienced severe immune reactions. The report found that "the trial design was not well suited to its objectives of testing the safety and tolerability of the drug."
				</p>
				<p>
					The working party recommended that phase I, "first in man," studies should include justification of the starting dose, assessment of its risk level and appraisal of the uncertainties. This should be given to the ethics committee, study participants, and insurers. Researchers should take a precautionary approach to study design for any experimental medicine that is "first in class" (and therefore high in risk) or which has a high dose specific risk.
				</p>
				<p>

				<h4>They broke the rules and the subject died</h4>
				<p>
					Thirty-six-year old Jolee Mohr died from bleeding and organ failure on July 24 after her knee was injected with an experimental genetically engineered drug. Questions are being about why she was recruited into a gene therapy experiment whose chief goal was to test the safety of a novel arthritis treatment. The events leading to Mohr's death suggest failures in the safety net to protect people from the risks of medical experimentation. Breaches of clinical research standards and a federal oversight system that allowed key decisions to be made behind closed doors may have helped draw Mohr into an experiment that was not what she thought it was.

					Company officials say they were upfront about risks, adhered to regulations and were terribly saddened by the loss.

				<h4>Data fabrication</h4>
				<p>
					The Delhi-based Society  For Scientific Values (SSV) said that a research team at the National Centre  for Cell Sciences (NCCS) in Pune was "guilty of misconduct for  falsification/fabrication of data" in two papers published in the Journal  of Biological Chemistry in 2004 and 2005. The journal withdrew the papers in  February 2007 amid allegations of data manipulation. The SSV noted that the  department of biotechnology, which is responsible for NCCS, had ignored  requests for information, and also withheld the first committee's findings.

Paraplegic patients - who paid Rs 1 lakh each for the treatment -- spoke  on their recovery.

				<p>
					The Supreme Court  overruled its 2005 direction and said that an MBBS is competent to perform  sterilisation operations, waiving the five years of gynaecological experience  it had mandated for this purpose. The government had pleaded that its family  planning efforst were affected due to the ruling following a public interest  litigation giving criteria for permitting doctors to do the procedure.

				<h4>Wrongly  imprisoned health professionals freed - but for a fee</h4>
				<p>
					Five Bulgarian nurses  and a Palestinian-born doctor were released after eight years of imprisonment,  torture and maltreatment in Libya for allegedly infecting more than 400  children with HIV. They have repeatedly denied the charges. Results of two  international reports, filed respectively by the WHO and a scientific duo hired  by the Libyan government, confirmed that the outbreak was nosocomial. The  release came with a price tag. The European Union promised medical support and  US$426 million for the families of the infected children.

In hospitals they were not allowed in  the wards but put up in corridors. The research was based on focused group discussions  among affected children, their adult caretakers as well as teachers and  healthcare workers.

				<h4>Enforcing  the PCPNDT Act, Mumbai style</h4>
				<p>
					A survey of 40 clinics  offering sonographies in Chembur, Mumbai, found that none of them followed the  rules in the Pre-Conceptual and Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act,  2002. Most did not display a board stating that 'determination of the sex of the  foetus is banned and illegal'. Only one maintained records of Form F containing  details on the patients scanned, reason for scan, etc. The survey was conducted  by an alliance of 10 non-governmental organisations, Laadli.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bombay Municipal  Corporation authorities admitted that they had neglected the PCPNDT Act. They  stated that only 501 of the 1,164 registered clinics had renewed their licenses  in the past year. They promised to start checking clinics and act against those  who have not complied with the law.
