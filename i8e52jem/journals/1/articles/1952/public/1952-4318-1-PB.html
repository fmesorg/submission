				<h4>Corruption in medical  care - is the market the cause?</h4>
				<p>
					One of the most striking features of medical care in India is the extreme  inequality between what it offered to the rich and to the poor. The majority of  patients living in villages do not have access to the most basic necessities  such as immunisation. The metros are flush with the latest technological  marvels several times over, the several magnetic resonance scanners being one  example. It is, however, a mistake to think that this metropolitan plenitude  necessarily translates into better medical care. Those with money to burn are  often subjected to unnecessary and inappropriate investigations. Often, the  results of such tests only complicate matters, cause unnecessary anxiety and  convert hitherto healthy captains of industry into quivering bundles of neurosis.  When such tests are followed by unjustified surgery, the horror is compounded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pressures of the market worsen the situation.  Let me provide an example. In the town where I live, a few doctors acquired a  computerised tomography scanner (CT). It was not long before the need to pay  instalments began to worry them. The group cajoled colleagues in practice to  refer patients for scanning by 'extending the indications for a scan'. The  ubiquitous practice of offering a financial incentive for such reference - disguised  as 'interpretation fee' - was already in vogue'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examples of unwarranted surgery abound.  Recently I saw a patient with tuberculosis of the lumbar spine without  neurological abnormality who had been subjected to an operation to fuse the  diseased vertebrae. It is standard practice to treat such patients with anti- tuberculous drugs alone as there is seldom any instability. Two months after  the operation, the plates and screws came off the bones they were supposed to  fuse. She had to undergo another operation to remove the metallic implants.  Examples such as these are numerous and each doctor sees only the tip of the  iceberg.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>lssues in Medical  Ethics</em>has discussed this  problem over the past three years. What is the solution ? I am not convinced  that appealing to the better instincts of the medical personnel is likely to  improve matters. The very organisations set up to ensure ethical practice - the  Medical Council of India and the state medical councils - are themselves mired  in corruption.
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe the only answer is removal of the  cause, namely the possibility of fleecing patients of huge sums. In other  words, we must abolish the market in medicine. This is possible through a  system that ensures universal medical coverage to all our citizens and registration,  perhaps by the state, of incomes of doctors and other personnel in the health  field. A socialised system will not easily lend itself to corruption.
