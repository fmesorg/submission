					Medical conferences are  fast degenerating into melas which educate, entertain, amuse and irritate and  deceive - not necessarily in that order. One can smell, see and feel the drug  industry everywhere, advertising on the walls, shaping the contents and style  of educational programmes, tempting with gifts and free meals, travel and other  amenities.
				</p>
				<p>
					We conducted a two-day  CME on critical care in community hospitals at our institute in October. Eleven  speakers covered 23 topics in the CME which was attended by 240 delegates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rs 3, 81,000 was raised  through registration fees, a grant from the Medical Council of India and drug  companies. Ninety-nine consultants and 79 faculty paid Rs 400 and 61 residents  paid Rs. 250 as registration fees (total Rs 81,000). The MCI gave Rs 80,000 to  pay for travel and accommodation of a foreign speaker and to produce the conference's  print proceedings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sixteen drug companies  paid a total of Rs 2.2 lakh towards the CME. In exchange, they were permitted  to set up booths along a passage next to the conference hall. Their banners  were restricted to this area. They were asked not to offer gifts of any kind,  or to organise any 'games'. They were also asked not to sponsor any hospitality  or indsividual speakers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The conference cost us  Rs 3, 28,000 - Rs 72,000 for speakers' travel (air travel to five and AC  two-tier train fare to another five), Rs 36,000 for accommodation and  transport, Rs 72,000 for food, Rs 17,000 for bags and the rest for  communication, printing, and other programme activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					We limited the presence  of the drug industry but failed to keep it out altogether. Is it possible to  organise a CME without industry funding? We think it is. Had we collected Rs  1000 from each delegate, we could have met all our expenses (through delegate  fees and MCI funds) without drug company funding. By doing away with bags and  keeping better track of other expenses we could have saved about Rs 20,000. A  two-day conference with about 200 delegates and 10 speakers held at our  institute should cost a little over Rs 3 lakh.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a meeting with the  Institute's management we pointed out that when drug companies sponsor  educational programmes, our students and residents get a distorted view of the  doctor- industry interface. We pointed to the examples of a paediatric  conference in Nagpur and another on ethics, both organised without industry support.  We pleaded that Sevagram could &mdash; and should &mdash; set an example with industry-free  CMEs. We stressed the need for regulations governing all medical conferences in  the institute.

				<h4>No more industry funding at Sevagram</h4>
				<p>
					Barely a week after the  conference, the college council members discussed means of reducing the role of  the pharmaceutical industry in sponsoring medical education at MGIMS, and  shaping doctors' prescription habits. At the end of the meeting, the council took  two path-breaking decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, companies  marketing drugs and medical equipment may no longer support any programme in  Sevagram. CME organisers may not accept advertisements or money from drug  companies in order to publish conference proceedings, souvenirs or information  leaflets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, the institute  committed to underwrite a substantial proportion of conference expenses. The  rest would have to come from delegate fees, and grants from the MCI and  government funding agencies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some doctors fear that  without funding from the industry, we will not be able to invite good speakers.  Also, the quality of hospitality, including the food, could be affected. We  feel that these fears are irrational. As for doctors' obsession with culinary  delights, are lavish lunches, dinners and drinks more important than food for  thought?
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors everywhere also  have a strange predilection for freebies. Dr MK Mani wrote of one conference,  "We can easily afford to buy an odd pen or briefcase, a flask or a  shopping bag. Yet no sooner did some company announce on the very loud audio  system that there were some goodies available at some stall, a long queue would  form there leaving the speaker to cast his wisdom on empty chairs. Do we need  to demean ourselves to this extent? Should we allow commercial interests to  dominate us so completely?" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mani MK. Letter from Chennai.

				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors should know that  there is no such thing as a free lunch. After attending sponsored conferences,  irrational prescriptions will start flowing from their pens. And the cosy  relationship between doctors and medical representatives does not escape  patients' discerning eyes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, conference s held  at five star hotels are bound to be expensive, more so when there is no  pressure to check wasteful expenditure. Our experience shows that we can  conduct an educationally useful programme in a medical college at just a little  over Rs three lakh. Doctors in India can surely afford to pay Rs 1,000 for a  conference. Institutional support will reduce the figure further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last year close to 11  billion dollars were spent on funding medical conferences the world over. We  are experimenting with the idea that simple, quality educational conferences  can be held without the industry's involvement, provided there is some  institutional support, and delegates agree to pay for their own education. Will  they or won't they? That is an eleven  billion dollar question.
