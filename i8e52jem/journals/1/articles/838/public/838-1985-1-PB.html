					In 2001, the British  Medical Association (BMA) launched its third and by far its most ambitious  report on medicine and human rights. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="BMA. The Medical Profession & Human Rights: handbook for a changing agenda, Zed books, 2001." id="1">(1)</a> The report lists 76 recommendations,  covering issues from ethics teaching and research to the involvement of doctors  in weapons' development and international justice. The association spent four  years collecting a massive amount of evidence to capture a sense of how human  rights affect doctors worldwide.
				</p>
				<p>
					One key recommendation  is that the medical profession needs to be sensitive to the routine  infringements of human rights that occur to some degree in almost every society  as well as to the gross violations. The latest report, therefore, is not just  about the medical role in torture, capital and corporal punishments or medical  neglect in prisons. It also carries recommendations about how the profession  can attempt to diminish a range of abusive practices against institutionalised  people and marginalised populations. It also considers issues such as female  infanticide, coerced abortion, "honour killings", child labour,  prostitution, people trafficking, domestic violence and attacks on detained  women and children. In many of these violations of human rights, healthcare  professionals are not directly involved but as witnesses and care providers can  draw them to public attention and be very influential in changing societal  attitudes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  BMA's general recommendation in this context is: "Doctors and professional  medical organisations can have a profound influence on attitudes and prejudices  within the communities in which they work.Compliance with practices that help  promote inequality and disadvantaging of girl children, for example, will be  seen as endorsement of the attitudes that underpin them. Medical education must  raise awareness of the possibilities for influencing society in a positive  direction and reducing unfair gender discrimination." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Recommendation 48, p.530." id="2">(2)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The report seeks to  provide practical advice and to encourage health professionals to pre-empt  rather than simply respond to violations of human rights by identifying early  indicators of a potential for abuse. In closed institutions, for example,  health professionals are among the first to encounter evidence of human rights  violations. They also have opportunities to see abusive situations developing  as they are often the only "outsiders" visiting prisons, police  stations and residential institutions for children, the elderly or people with  disabilities. The report recommends that they familiarise themselves with best  practice in order to be able to recognise the absence of effective safeguards  to prevent brutality in such situations. In many situations, however, health  workers have little room to manoeuvre. When they protest, they often find  themselves victimised or ostracised. They may face pressure from the police and  the political hierarchy to keep quiet about evidence of human rights  violations. They may also face pressure from the victim's family who fear  reprisals. This does not mean that they can ignore abuse but they may need to  think laterally about how to protest effectively. One of the most damaging  aspects of many abuses is that individuals caught up in them feel isolated and  unsupported. The desirability of network building across traditional  professional boundaries, involving health workers, lawyers, human rights  activists and the responsible media, is a recommendation running through all  the chapters of the report. Another concerns the obligations of professional  organisations to support their own members as well as colleagues in other  countries where human rights are under attack.
				</p>
				<p>
					The BMA is a voluntary  professional organisation representing the interests of doctors in Britain. Its  policies and priorities are determined by its members at annual meetings, many  of which have shown a continuing preoccupation with issues of human rights,  social justice and the poor health of marginalised populations. The view,  argued in this and previous BMA reports, is that such issues form natural and  correct areas of concern for the medical profession and professional  organisations. The latest report shows how doctors deal with challenges to  well-established ethical principles that also happen to coincide with  fundamental principles of human rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless, little of  the information in the latest BMA report is surprising. Medical human rights  groups around the world have a good record of monitoring human rights. The BMA  report pulls together many strands, including documented case histories,  evidence from doctors, ideas for strategies to deal with abuse and solid  ethical and public health arguments for getting involved in human rights from  medical school onwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Professionals such as  doctors, lawyers and academics, because of their education and earning power,  can often exercise an influence over the values of the societies in which they  work. One of the key recommendations of the report is that where they can have  an influence, they should use it positively. Many human rights abuses are  tacitly tolerated because they focus on an unpopular victim group portrayed as  undeserving of sympathy - prisoners, criminals, street children, ethnic or  religious minorities and political dissidents. By co-ordinated action through their  professional bodies, health professionals can try to change societal attitudes  that discriminate against certain marginalised groups and permit harmful  practices to flourish. They cannot stop violence against such populations or  religious groups or against women and children but they can show how  discrimination impairs people's health, impacts badly on public health and  undermines respect for the society that tolerates them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among other things, the  BMA's report looks at how human rights violations may result from an  accumulation of many small acts or omissions by people who should protest but  for a variety of reasons fail to do so. Fear may prevent them but often it is  more mundane than that. Doctors - like anyone else - often just want to  concentrate on doing their job, turn a blind eye to things they would rather  not see and persuade themselves that they are not the real wrongdoers even if  they go along with a flawed or corrupt system. Rather than acknowledging that  their own failure to act in defence of basic rights contributes to the chain of  abuse, they may reassure themselves with the excuse that their small part in  the process is insignificant.
				</p>
				<p>
					One problem, therefore,  is how to convince doctors and medical organisations of the relevance of human  rights to their own work by showing how their inaction can allow abuse to  happen under their noses. Health professionals see their role as predominantly  being humanitarian service providers. In the past, few health organisations  have envisaged their role as encompassing a socio-political dimension which  could address the root causes of human rights violations. This has begun to  change, however. The recently updated Code of Medical Ethics from the Medical  Council of India <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="MCI. Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. Gazette of India dated 06.04.02, part III, section 4." id="3">(3)</a>, for example, now mentions human rights as well as ethical  duties. In many countries, there is growing evidence of a willingness within  medical bodies to become involved in political action and education.  Frequently, this involves working with politically outspoken non-governmental organisations,  including those involved in human rights, redress, refugee welfare and prison  reform.
				</p>
				<p>
					An argument in favour of  medical organisations becoming involved in human rights is the fact that they  exist to serve the interests of the medical profession. Prominent among those  interests must be the preservation of the honour and high ideals traditionally  associated with medicine. Therefore, the BMA has long argued that raising  awareness of human rights is a key duty of professional bodies and that this duty  fits well with the role of providing guidance on professional ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					For  over 50 years, the BMA argued that: 'Doctors must be quick to point out to  their fellow members of society the likely consequences of policies that  degrade or deny fundamental human rights. The profession must be vigilant to  observe and to combat developments which might ensnare its members and debase  the high purpose of its ideals." <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Statement published by the BMA Council in 1947. Quoted in the Introduction to the BMA report, p.xix." id="4">(4)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Public health concerns  are another argument for such involvement. Some medical organisations are  increasingly showing interest in human rights where there are clear public  health consequences, such as when people are likely to be left dependent and  disabled. Some are taking action to try abolish practices such as the flogging  of prisoners, judicial amputation and sale of organs. Practices such as female  infanticide and restrictions on the education of females also impact directly  on the health and balance of society. Moving from documenting abuse to seeking  practical safeguards to minimise it, medical organisations are increasingly  identifying a humanitarian and public health role which coincides with the  protection of human rights. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency and  it is still far from easy to mobilise the profession to take up the health  challenges that arise from persistent violation of human rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					More generally, the way  in which such challenges are addressed is changing. Effective interchange  between different disciplines on human rights issues is developing rapidly as  e-mail and the Internet facilitate projects involving a range of specialists  around the globe. Lawyers, journalists, medical groups and human rights  organisations have more opportunities than ever to co-ordinate their campaigns  and information gathering. Frameworks for co-operation already exist but they  have been developing in a piecemeal fashion. Too often different professionals  still work on parallel, rather than intersecting lines, without pooling  acquired expertise. Individuals and organisations still invest time and effort  in reinventing action programmes that have already been tried out elsewhere.  Where strategies have proved successful in one context, information about them  needs to be shared with others facing similar human rights challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, the report also  calls for more multi-professional discussion about the development of proactive  measures to give some advance protection to those who are most likely to  witness evidence of human rights violations. Disseminating information about  abuse is no longer enough. Practical measures are needed for moving the debate  forward. The BMA is well aware that recommendations alone change nothing and  that by far the harder task lies in pressing for their implementation.
