					Most codes on ethics in medicine prohibit advertising
					by doctors. There are good reasons for this
					prohibition. As professionals, it ill behoves us to
					publicly sing our own praises or solicit patients. We must
					await clients by referrals from colleagues or by word of
					mouth. Were physicians to advertise, patients run the risk
					of being lured to the one with the fanciest media coverage
					rather than to the most competent and experienced. This
					prohibition gains greater validity in a country such as India
					where ignorance and gullibility abound. This does not
					deprive the extraordinary physician of renown. Noteworthy
					contributions to medical theory or practice are legitimately
					published in medical journals after being subject to review
					by peers and can command admiration from colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having known Dr. Aniruddha Malpani for several years
					and respected his abilities and expertise, I was unpleasantly
					surprised to run across his internet site www.drmalpani.com/pcss/index.htm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The site advertises the Malpani clinic as 'the best place to
					have a baby'. Clicking on 'Read what the press has to say
					about our clinic and the services we offer' takes one to a
					series of press reports featuring the clinic or statements made
					by Dr. and Dr. Mrs. Malpani. Here is an excerpt from this
					section:
				</p>
				<p>
					"City doctor proclaims the end of male infertility ...
					"IS THERE any viable option for infertile male patients to
					father a child? Yes, says a city-based doctor, who attains
					the distinction of being the first medico in the country to
					treat such patients successfully. The new treatment is
					expected to illumine the lives of many unhappy couples.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Dr Aniruddha Malpani, a well known specialist in
					infertility problems, has successfully impregnated a woman
					with testicular sperms for the first time in the country. Besides,
					he has also achieved fertilisation with precursor germ cells
					like spermatids , which is contrary to the known scientific
					wisdom that only matured and developed sperms can initiate
					pregnancy...Dr. Malpani's clinical success shows that even
					the most sterile patient can now be successfully treated by
					testicular sperm injection.
				</p>
				<p>
					"However, the treatment charges are quite expensive,
					ranging around Rs 90,000 for a single attempt.
				</p>
				<p>
					"This cost, though cheap compared to that of the western
					countries, is beyond the reach of many in our country," Dr.
					Malpani laminated (sic) adding that the charges would gate
					(sic) reduced as the treatment percolates down to a wider
					strata of the society."
				</p>
				<p>
					The site also features three reports filed in the Times of
					India on 5 and 6 November 2000. These suggest that 'medical
					tourism' to India could be yet another source of foreign
					exchange for this country. Since the cost of treatment here
				</p>
				<p>
					is a fraction of those in the West, Indian doctors can expect
					to attract patients frustrated by long waiting lists in their
					own countries. All three reports quote statements made by
					Dr. Malpani. Following on the heels of these reports was a
					letter by Dr. Malpani printed in the correspondence column
					of this newspaper, justifying advertising by Indian doctors
					on the web so as to attract such tourists and their lucre.
				</p>
				<p>
					I remain unconvinced of the 'benefits' of advertising and
					am worried about its ill effects. For every Dr. Malpani who
					advertises one can expect scores of charlatans and quacks.
					Given the non-existent control on medical malpractice in
					India, and the example of 'Dr. Majid' who misled victims of
					AIDS for such a long time, advertising is more likely to
					worsen the plight of individuals who are already sick and
					desperate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given our circumstances, advertisement by doctors remains
					unethical even in the digital age.
				</p>
				<p>
					Postscript: A section on the Malpani site offers
					Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis - a technique used to
					rule out genetic disorders in the embryo- to select the sex of
					your baby. Since this technique enables identification of
					the sex of the test-tube embryo prior to implantation and the
					selective implantation of only those embryos that show up
					as male, Dr. Malpani's clinic panders to families desiring
					baby boys. Presumably, embryos of the undesired sex are
					destroyed. Although Dr. Malpani concedes that this
					technique raises certain 'worries and concerns', his lengthy
					defence of such a practice suggests that he has convinced
					himself that no wrong is being done.
