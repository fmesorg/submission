				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					The health care  scenario for women, especially apropos reproductive health, is highly  exploitative, with extensive human rights violations. Women are treated as  expendable entities.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Documented malpractice  and possible cures</h4>
				<p>
					Malpractice has been observed and documented in the following medical  interventions relating to reproductive health:
				</p>
				<ol type="I">
					<li>
						<h5>Unsafe methods of  abortion vis-a-vis the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act.</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The MTP Act provides the right to safe abortion to women to prevent their  exploitation at the hands of unscrupulous abortionists. This professed purpose  has failed. Presently unsafe (illegal) abortions far exceed safe abortions, the  ratio being 20: 1.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result, unsafe abortions today constitute  the single largest cause of pregnancy-related deaths. This is because the  safety provisions of the MTP Act are not implemented by the health authorities.  Whilst this may be just another example of the ubiquitous lack of monitoring by  concerned authorities, a more sinister explanation could be a deliberate &lsquo;blind  eye' to achieve population control through MTP.
					</p>
					<p>
						The safety provisions in the MTP Act require  approval and monitoring of a MTP centre to ensure required surgical facilities  and approval of the doctor's qualification, competence and training. Abortion  after 12 weeks of pregnancy is allowed only after consultation with two doctors  and abortion is prohibited after the 20th week of pregnancy.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Remedy:</strong> Ensuring facilities for safe abortion  by strict implementation of the provisions of the MTP Act and by taking legal  action against health authorities who fail to do so. </p>
					<li>
						<h5>Unsafe  contraceptives</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						The Intra Uterine Device (IUD) is inserted without proper evaluation of the  recipient woman for genital tract infection. This can cause ascending infection  leading to pelvic inflammatory disease with painful menstrual periods, blockage  of fallopian tubes, resulting in sterility or tubal pregnancy and even  peritonitis leading to death.
					</p>
					<p>
						Laparoscopic fallopian tube ligations are  carried out improperly. This is due to compromise of mandatory surgical norms  by using unsterile laparoscopes or by using unsafe procedures in place of those  prescribed e. g. peritoneal insufflation with atmospheric air in place of  carbon dioxide. At times, a cycle pump has been used for insufflation. As  anticipated, the procedure fails and is attended by an increased rate of  complications as the result of these unhygienic and unsafe practices. These  lead to a high incidence of ectopic pregnancy and catastrophic illness with  high mortality even where surgical facilities are available. The situation is  worse in a rural setting. The estimated number of such deaths due to faulty tubectomies  is 500 for the 5 million ligations presently done per year.
					</p>
					<p>
						The use of contraceptive pills without prior  tests to ensure normal liver function constitutes a much greater hazard in our  population as there is a high prevalence of liver diseases such as viral  hepatitis (3% of our population is in the carrier stage of hepatitis-B while  hepatitis-E is endemic) and amoebic hepatitis is common in our country. Other  factors such as compromised liver function due to malnutrition, toxic damage  from anti-tubercular drugs, consumption of aflatoxin from ill preserved food  grains, toxic pesticide residues in food and water, and alcohol consumption  increase the likelihood of liver disease in our population.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> Peers in the profession practising ethical  medicine, especially those practicing obstetrics and gynaecology, should invoke  and insist upon exact adherence to medical ethics framed under the Medical  Council of India (MCI) Act.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Prescription of  unsafe drugs in pregnancy</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						There is a large number of drugs specifically contraindicated in pregnancy and  a still larger number of drugs that are considered unsafe in pregnancy and  should be avoided as far as possible. At present, drugs are prescribed  indiscreetly and indiscriminately unmindful of their safety in pregnancy. This  has caused a high rate of adverse outcomes in pregnancy such as miscarriages,  still births and congenital defects.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> Establishment of Drug Information Centres to  educate doctors and patients on the safety status of drugs in pregnancy.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Pesticide residues  in food</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						These have an especially deleterious effect on the pregnant mother and the  child in the womb. It is responsible for adverse pregnancy outcomes and  congenital malformations especially of the brain and spinal cord, more so in  female foetuses.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> Awareness and education programmes with  stricter implementation of the Insecticide Act.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Aggressive  advertisement of drugs and self-medication</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Women are targets for aggressive advertisement of drugs and tonics in the lay  press as they are perceived to have concerns about menstrual periods, figure-consciousness and the well being of their children. The so-called uterine  tonics, menstrual regulators, blood purifiers, slimming remedies and brain and  health tonics for children are heavily advertised and encourage self-medication with drugs of doubtful and unproven efficacy, an obviously  fraudulent practice.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> Insistence on implementation of the  provisions of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable) Advertisement Act  that prohibits such advertisements. The offence is cognisable and the editor,  publisher and advertiser are all individually and collectively liable. Action  may also be initiated under the Press Council Act.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Advertisement of abortion</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Abortion is legal under the MTP Act but its advertisement is not permitted  under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable) Advertisement Act.  Soliciting patients is unethical under the Medical Council Act. In spite of  this, there is promotion and propagation of abortion through agressive  advertisements in the lay press, railway compartments, buses and billboards.  Perhaps the lack of the enforcement of the ban on advertising is because of its  tacit but illegal use as a population control measure by the government.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unsafe abortions with their attendant miseries  and deaths are on the rise as a result of this policy and exceed those in the  pre-legalisation days.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Surgical excesses  on women apropos pregnancy</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						There is a rising  trend of Caesarean births, unnecessary episiotomy as a routine in all first  deliveries in hospitals. We also see rising rates of hysterectomy at an early  age.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> The Medical Council Act provides protection  against unnecessary surgical interventions. This should be invoked to penalise  wrong-doers.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Experiments on  women and methods of abortion for contraceptive methods</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Improperly planned, unapproved and unethical experiments by the population  control zealots amongst medical men are presently widespread as reported in the  Indian medical journals e. g. reports in <em>Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>, India . For example, an abortion paste  called FETEX PASTE was approved and used on a mass scale killing hundreds of  women, till reports of the deaths led to its withdrawal .
					</p>

					<li>
						<h5>Unregulated,  assisted pregnancy</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Frequent genital tract infection and indiscriminate invasive interventions have  resulted in high prevalence of infertility amongst our women. Infertility  carries a great social stigma. Taking advantage of their emotional and social  vulnerability, a crop of self-proclaimed, mostly unqualified and untrained  fertility specialists has sprouted, claiming to provide hi-tech facilities,  always at an exorbitant cost.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Remedy:</strong> Assisted reproduction should be strictly  monitored, supervised and controlled. It should be cost-effective and  subsidised as part of the family planning programme.
					</p>

					<li>
						<h5>Gender bias in  availability of health care facilities</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						A survey of Rajasthan's leading paediatric hospital in Jaipur city showed that  of all the children brought to the hospital, 70% were males and 30% females. Of  those admitted to the hospital 80% were male. This bias in an urban, largely  educated population calls for serious introspection

					<em>Fee-splitting or  dichotomy in any shape or form is always unethical. It means obtaining money  from a patient without disclosing in the bill that is submitted, the manner in  which it is made up. Should the patient come to know of the underhand manner in  which the doctor has split the fee he received for professional service, with a  practitioner who brought the patient to him, the patient can institute legal  proceedings against the doctor. The offence is punishable in law.</em> <strong>&ndash; Dr. Rustom N. Cooper</strong>
