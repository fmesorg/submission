				<h4>Bimal K. Bachhawat  symposium on genome research: Emerging ethical, legal, social and economic  issues. 22 - 23 May 1997, Goa.</h4>

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Bachhawat's death  has left a void that is deeply felt by workers in the field of science in  general and those in biochemistry, the neurosciences and novel drug delivery  systems in particular. One manifestation of the depth of feeling was the  decision by the National Academy of Sciences, India, to hold its inaugural  symposium in the series on Interface of Science with Society in his honour.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his letter inviting participants to this  meeting, <strong>Dr. M. G. K. Menon</strong> wrote of how recent developments in molecular biology and  genetics have provided an unprecedented insight into the basis of many traits  and diseases and enabled us to probe, diagnose and treat hitherto  unapproachable conditions. But these advances have also raised ethical, legal  and socio- cultural issues with significant long-term implications for  humanity. Whilst they provide powerful tools, they are also open to abuse which  could threaten society. As we consider ways and means for developing genetic  research in India, it is imperative that we work in parallel to evolve  techniques for addressing the ethical, legal and socio- economic implications  of such research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirteen delegates from the United States,  United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Egypt and Japan joined thirty- two delegates  from India in the four day deliberations held by the seaside. Having everyone  staying together throughout the duration of the symposium ensured close  interaction between all participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst inaugurating the symposium, <strong>Dr. M. G. K. Menon</strong> set the tone by quoting from a letter sent to  him by Dr. James D. Watson on 15 May. Whilst apologising for his inability to  attend, Dr. Watson made these observations:
				</p>
				<p>
					"I believe that genetic knowledge has the  power to transform for the better all aspects of human life and that individuals  have the right to make choices based on genetic information. But this must be  done responsibly and with due regard to the differing needs of different  peoples.. ."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Menon organised this meeting in India to  focus on implications for developing countries as the deliberations of such  organisations as UNESCO tend to consider aspects concerning the western world.
				</p>
				<p>
					A brief analysis of some of the discussions at  this meeting is provided below.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The human genome project</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Jan Witkowski,Cold Spring Harbour, USA,</strong> traced the origins of this  study to the need to spend the twenty million dollars left over after  construction of the telescope in Hawaii. The US Department of Energywas then  keen on studying genetic mutations in workers in nuclear facilities in the  country. The project took off after Dr. James Watson organised the meeting on  molecular biology of homo sapiens at Cold Spring Harbour in May 1986. Walter  Gilbert and Paul Berg led the discussion on the sequencing of the human genome.  The budget for such research has risen from eighteen million dollars in 1986 to  one hundred and ninety million dollars in 1997.
				</p>
				<p>
					When  Watson was asked to head the project, in a far-sighted move, he allocated up to  5% of the total budget allocated for it by the US Congress to studies on the  ethical aspects of such studies. It is also significant that a debate on  whether or not it was right to patent DNA sequences was conducted almost at the  start. Alongside the research, discussion on such topics as whether there was a  genetic predisposition towards sub-optimal performance and criminal tendencies  prompted such headlines as <em>Man's genes made him kill</em>, <em>his lawyers  claim, </em>in  the <em>Wall  Street Journal</em>.  The feature on Dolly in <em>The New Yorker </em>was accompanied by a cartoon on the cover  showing cloned Einsteins. In a light vein, Dr. Witkowski pointed out that there  is no guarantee that clones of Einstein would not develop into master drug  dealers. He also saw, in the future, a scenario where a prospective employer  may conclude an interview with the statement: "Your resume is satisfactory.  Please leave your DNA sample with my secretary," so as to use genetic data to  weed out undesirables.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  touched briefly on some ethical issues. Who owns the human genome and the DNA  samples acquired during the studies? How can researchers ensure that benefits  are transferred to those from whom genetic material was obtained? Is there a  need to debate and, if necessary, counter statements implying that a variety of  deficiencies and anti- social behaviour and activities can be attributed to our  genes? Can genetic findings be used to explain abnormal behaviour at all, given  that upbringing and the environment play such important roles?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Genetic research in India</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  H. G. Sarat Chandra,The Indian Institute of Science,</strong> referred to the special  challenges offered to geneticists in India by the diversity of populations, the  consequence of the social dictates of the caste system and our tribal  populations. He was sorry that there are few laboratories in the country that  can offer diagnosis based on DNA studies and that several of them are divorced  from medical colleges and hospitals. Results offered in the absence of such  proximity are likely to lead to misinterpretation or worse as there is no  direct responsibility to patients. He also showed that the fact that no new  human gene has been mapped or cloned in India is an indicator of the poor  quality of research in the country. Dr. Obaid Siddiqui's laboratory is the only  one to have to its credit the identification of the gene for olfaction in  melanogaster. Referring to the protests against shipping blood and DNA samples  abroad for the diagnosis of genetic disorders or research, he asked how such  shipments can be stopped without setting up a chain of DNA laboratories. The  present regulations call for clearance from the Indian Council of Medical  Research before every export of tissue -- permission that may take six or more  months! In any event, do we have the mechanism for monitoring the shipping of  blood samples or DNA by any individual in the country? Instead, would it not be  better to ensure that a model agreement safeguarding the interests of the  individual, the laboratory sending the tissue and the country is signed each  time tissue is exported?
				</p>
				<p>
					He  pleaded for the development of a well planned, equipped and staffed chain of  DNA laboratories connected with medical colleges and hospitals, grouped into  consortia. Once this is achieved, large numbers of tests can be performed with  the consequent development of confidence in their reliability.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  identified some peculiarly Indian medical problems that deserve genetic study:  hot water epilepsy and cholineesterase mutations that cause prolonged apnoea  and disallow rapid emergence from general anaesthesia in some communities (e.g.  vaishyas in south India). He also discussed the need to study the human  diversity seen on this subcontinent and use genetic studies as a tool to  understand the evolution of languages and migrations.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  the same time he cautioned against the misuse of genetic data. He pointed to  the manner in which sonography was used by parents not to detect malformations  in the foetus but to abort the girl foetus.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Legal aspects of genetic research</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Harold Edgar,Professor of Law at Columbia University, USA,</strong> restricted his observations  to American law where rulings can vary from state to state. In general, law on  genetic research deals with the issue of information obtained from tests and  research. To whom does it belong? Who can use it? American law was designed to  encourage research. To this end, universities were permitted to patent and  commercially exploit information even when it was gained from federally funded  research. Under this proviso in the law, American universities carefully  monitor the transfer of tissue or DNA from their laboratories to other  universities or centres, safeguarding their own interests. Negotiated  agreements precede such transfers. Patenting has led to several complications.  A single process may involve so many steps that are patented that the payment  of royalties can be quite a complex issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  a case that came before a court, it was ruled that an individual does not have  property rights over his own tissue once this has been removed as part of  therapy and handed over to the clinic for analysis. This decision is under  debate. When material is collected for research, it is mandatory that informed  consent be obtained after explaining possible commercial benefits from the  patenting of sequences or other information obtained from such studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					American  law prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic information especially in  such areas as insurance and employment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. David Robert(U. K.)</strong> argued on behalf of  pharmaceutical companies, for whom the patenting of life forms and genes is  important. Me referred to the massive expenditure involved in genetic research  and felt that if rewards in the form of the proceeds from patents were prohibited,  there will be little research in this field and few cures emerging from it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. N. R. Madhava Menon,National Law School, Bangalore,</strong> referred to the Indian  apprehension that tissues and other genetic material have been and are being  taken out of India for the financial benefit of foreign agencies. He felt that  human rights cannot be encapsulated under informed consent and must be  individually referred to in documents of such consent. Indian courts will  strike down any patent interfering with the right to live.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  suggested consideration of an international, multilateral treaty on genomic  research ensuring fair play and guaranteeing the right to live with dignity in  all countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					India  needs to take cognisance of the impact of genetic research on family law  (surrogate parenthood or the demand by one partner, seeking marriage, for  genetic information on the other), employment law (demands for genetic  information from prospective employees), criminal law (genetic fingerprinting)  and so on. Special care is needed as our courts of law are dilatory,  enforcement is lax and poverty rampant.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  would be best to take legal steps to establish accountability so that no  consideration other than science prevails. To do so, we must focus on two  issues:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Professional responsibility.</em> In the absence of an educated, responsible  society, professionals carry the onerous duty of organising their activities  along ethical principles and in the public interest. The code of ethics may  need revision. The profession must take disciplinary action against  malfeasants. The professions have been granted considerable autonomy and they  must exercise it responsibly.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Interaction between medical and legal professions is essential.</em> Only thus will legal  minds be made aware of the intricacies of biomedical advances and of the legal  steps that must follow in the interests of society. Scientists and medical  doctors also need to understand legal niceties to realise the implications of  their studies and findings.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion on above papers</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Prakash N. Tandon,President, The National Academy of Sciences, India,</strong> highlighted the many  questions thrown up by genetic research:
				</p>
				<p>
					Can  we evolve a system where, through mutual collaboration between developing and  developed nations, equitable distribution of services, facilities and wealth is  established?
				</p>
				<p>
					Is  it germane for developing countries to worry about genetic research when there  are so many more relevant problems screaming for attention?
				</p>
				<p>
					When  we are short of manpower and facilities to provide genetic counselling, should  we permit multinationals to bring genetic therapy into India?
				</p>
				<p>
					When  individual informed consent is difficult (for a variety of reasons), should we  accept consent of the leader of the community or tribal group?
				</p>
				<p>
					Should  an individual be screened for a disease -- such as Alzheimer's disease -- that  may develop decades later?
				</p>
				<p>
					Once  genetic screening has been carried out and markers -- for Alzheimer's disease  for example -- detected in an individual, to whom can this information be  released? To the family? To employers? To insurers? What about the genetic test  showing that the husband is not the biological father of a child?
				</p>
				<p>
					Addressing  the latter problem, <strong>Dr. Lalji Singh of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular  Biology, Hyderabad,</strong> told  us of the Indian couple living in England with three children. When the father  returned from India with a fourth child, who, he claimed, was his, the  immigration authorities requested DNA fingerprinting to establish paternity. It  turned out that this fourth child was, indeed, his child but the first of the  three children in England was not his biological offspring. The British expert  confined his remarks in court to the fourth child, keeping the results of the  first child confidential in order to preserve the integrity of the family.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethical aspects of genetic research</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Bryony Soper, The Wellcome Trust, UK, </strong>spoke of the social and  ethical implications of genetic research. Genetic researchers must forge links  with others to ensure optimal use of their findings for the benefit of society:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Other basic sciences
					</li>
					<li>
						Clinical sciences
					</li>
					<li>
						Social scientists
					</li>
					<li>
						Cultural scientists
					</li>
					<li>
						Psychologists
					</li>
					<li>
						Political scientists
					</li>
					<li>
						Economists
					</li>
					<li>
						Commercial interests.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Analysis  of the outcome of genetic research must include consideration of whether it is  of multi- disciplinary interest, has practical applications, is of mainstream  interest and is of long- term importance. Research findings that can be  converted, simply and easily, into practice and public policy are to be  especially welcomed. "Facts must be put through the loom of adequate  dissemination, overview and review by doctors and policy makers and analysts  concentrating on impact on society with the sole purpose of being woven into a  fabric useful to society."
				</p>
				<p>
					She  also discussed the role of counselling before any genetic test. Counselling  must elicit answers to such questions as: "If the test is positive, would  you like to be told? Would you like your family to be told? Which members would  you like informed? Would you like to restrict information? Can you tell us of  individuals and agencies you do not wish us to inform? If the studies carried  on the material supplied by you lead to material benefit from patents or other  spin- offs, would you like us to exploit them? How can we share those benefits  with you?"
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Troy Duster, Institute for the Study of Social Change,  Berkeley, California, USA,</strong> discussed  genetic screening. He asked the question, "Who's screening whom for  what?" and cautioned against individuals and groups working on the basis  of conflict and mistrust. He spoke of politics in screening risk populations.  Scientific screening necessitates the trust and co-operation of local medical  practitioners.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  least controversial is prenatal screening of the foetus for the detection of  life- threatening illness and postnatal screening intended to aid and direct  therapy. The screening of carriers of serious illnesses is essential to ensure  that couples get married not on the basis of horoscopes but on those of genetic  screening so that their offspring are spared genetically transmitted disease.  He told us of the rabbi in New York who has ensured that the results of genetic  screening of his flock are sent only to him. When a couple declares intent to  marry, he consults his genetic data bank and advises whether or not they are  made for each other. This arrangement spares the individual knowledge that  could be psychologically traumatic and, at the same time, eliminates the  genetic transmission of disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  listed areas of concern in genetic screening:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Unequal relationship between       clinician in white coat and the person being tested.
					</li>
					<li>
						Need to add social context to data       obtained from genetic tests before the report is passed on to the person       being tested is not always followed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Patients often find it difficult to       understand that the mere presence of a gene does not indicate that the       disease will develop or when it will develop.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					They  also find it difficult to understand such statements as "The risk of  developing this disease is one in four." If the disease does develop, they  inevitably ask, "Why me?" Mothers expect that since they already have  a child with the disease, the next three children will definitely be free of  disease, neglecting the fact that for each subsequent child, there is a  one-in-four risk of developing the disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Individuals  requesting genetic screen tests expect a definitive answer whereas such tests  often provide only probabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  some instances tests lead to other tests that may involve risks. He gave the  example of search for the gene for breast cancer. When such a gene is found in  a woman, she is then advised serial mammograms which, by themselves, may  increase the risk of breast cancer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Marcos Palatnik, Brazil,</strong> cautioned against the  seduction of technoscience. Ethics is based on wisdom and experiences from the  past whilst technoscience focuses on the future. We need a sagacious marriage  of these two.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is a need for the intelligent use of all available genetic tests but using only  carefully selected tests to counter the fears of society -- the permanent fear  of death, cyclical fear of epidemic disease (such as AIDS), the fears of the  majority (as of debilitating disease and poverty) and those of the elite (such  as an invalid or undisciplined work force).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Partha Majumdar,Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta,</strong> discussed studies on the  diversity of the human genome in India. Genetic distances between populations  provide useful data for reconstructing and dating evolutionary history. Genetic  differences between individuals in a population are responsible for conferring  resistance to disease in some and susceptibility to the same disease in others.  The goals of epidemiological genetic screening, then, are to quantify genomic  variation and participate in the creation of a world-wide database of genetic  polymorphism, trace genetic trails of human migration, reconstruct the  evolutionary history of populations and identify susceptibility and resistance  genes for diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any  researcher in this field must possess three essentials: honesty, respect for  the culture and values of the population being studied and a willingness to be  subjected to peer review.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical  problems encountered during such studies include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Relevance to local needs
					</li>
					<li>
						Informed consent during the collection of blood and tissue samples.
					</li>
					<li>
						Laboratory analysis.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use and interpretation of data  obtained from research.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sharing of samples.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sharing of data.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					He  suggested that great care be taken in obtaining informed consent and narrated  his own experience and practice. Where no direct benefit is likely to ensue to  the donor of blood or tissue, this must be clearly indicated. In many  communities villagers are illiterate and hence cannot offer a written consent.  Verbal consent is inadequate as witnesses may not be available or traceable  after a few years. They are unwilling to place their thumb print on any paper  as past experiences have shown that each time they have done so, they have  suffered through exploitation or the loss of personal or communal property. Dr.  Majumdar has therefore evolved the practice of recording on video-tape every  discussion with the community at large and the individual donor to show that  there was adequate explanation of the pros and cons and that the donation of  tissue has been voluntary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditional  anthropology did not face these ethical problems. Those researchers lived as  part of the populations they were studying. They thus established an intimate  rapport with the local people and were often integrated into them. Verrier  Elwin is an example. They collected data and let it speak for itself. The modem  geneticist works in a diametrically opposite manner. First of all, he  formulates a hypothesis. He then designs and carries out a study to confirm it.  He has no time for the population being studied and has no understanding of  their concerns and anxieties. There is, thus, a great need to ensure informed  consent and transmission of material benefits from the study to the group  studied.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is also necessary to pass on vital information to the individuals studied. Data  on blood groups and information on where treatment for diseases detected during  or as a consequence of the study can be obtained fall in this category.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  made the important point that steps should be taken by all workers in genetic  research, especially those involved in n epidemiological research, that there  is just one transfer of genetic material -- from the point of collection to a  single research laboratory. All further transfers must only be made under  protection of a legal document safeguarding the interests of the persons and  community where the specimens were obtained and the laboratory itself. Cell  lines must only be stored in repositories within our national boundaries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confidentiality  must be guaranteed in the use of data. When sharing data, the identity of the  individual from whom the sample was obtained must be kept secret. No data  should be provided for any purpose that will harm the community or the  individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patenting  is a dilemma. Is it right for the researcher to patent tissue obtained from a  voluntary donor? Should DNA sequences be patented? Can life be patented?
				</p>
				<p>
					If  patenting is required so that funds are made available for research, benefits  to society must be ensured in all relevant legal documents. It is also  necessary to make certain that entrepreneurs develop local laboratories and  industries and not siphon off samples and proceeds to developed countries. It  is also important to ensure that vital data is not suppressed by industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Mammen Chandy, Professor of Haematology, Christian Medical  College and Hospital, Vellore,</strong> emphasised that in a poor country such as  India, modern genetic tools are all the more necessary to prevent genetically  transmitted diseases that are such a drain on familial economies. We also need  recombinant therapies for the treatment of patients with haemophilia,  deficiency of human growth factor, erythropoetin and thrombopoetin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such  tools can only be provided by heavy investments and the state must take the  lead in making such investments possible. It is also important to ensure that  all recipients of such therapy pay, the rich subsidising the poor. He cautioned  against providing free services. Such services are often viewed with suspicion.  "What is the hidden or ulterior motive of this person who is offering this  free of cost?" He found tablets to correct iron deficiency anaemia,  offered free to the poor, being thrown away.
				</p>
				<p>
					If  collaboration is necessary between Indian and foreign agencies, there must be a  genuine transfer of technology into India with tangible benefits to Indian  science and society. We also need collaboration between all the centres within  India with genuine sharing of expertise, facilities and data. Such interactions  can also help in the development of inter- laboratory quality controls.  Transparency is essential for such exchanges.
				</p>

				<h4>Discussion on above papers</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  R. R. Kishore, Assistant Director General, Ministry of Health,</strong> showed that genetic  screening had social and economic implications. The findings of such screening  can violate confidentiality and impose a stigma. He felt it should be  restricted to the identification of populations with high- risk of genetically  transmitted diseases such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Professor M. G. K. Menon</strong> felt that we should be concentrating on  serious genetically transmitted illnesses with grave impact on public health  and the economy. It is also important to start with diseases where we have  something to offer either by way of prevention or therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Mammen Chandy</strong> cautioned that where genetic screening and  other studies have the sanction of the state, the borderline between voluntary  and mandatory screening might get blurred. The imposition of quotas to state  employees has been known to breed compulsion that the poor cannot resist. To  ensure sensitivity to ethics down the line, he suggested training programmes  that would educate the entire research team .from the top down on ethical  principles. He also requested built-in monitoring of practices all along the  line to ensure that ethical considerations are not flouted. This should form an  essential component of research on research.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  his experience with families having children suffering genetically transmitted  diseases, the demand for counselling services far outstrips their availability.  He pleaded for the development of a cadre that will provide such services.  Recruitment to this cadre may be made from those trained in medical social  work. It will be necessary to impart training in genetics to these counsellors.  Ideally, counsellors must hail from the same ethnic and cultural backgrounds as  the populations being studied so that they blend with them.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  also told us of an interesting experience in Rajkot, Gujarat. Here, genetic  information, far from providing a stigma, has led to constructive social  action. A social group working on behalf of families with thalassaemia found  out that Amitabh Bachchan is a thalassaemia carrier. A statement from him to  this effect was given wide publicity. Thalassaemia carriers now voiced  confidence. "I am like Amitabh Bachchan." As a consequence, Rajkot  newspapers now carry advertisements for marriage stating that the applicant is  a thalassaemia carrier, requesting a partner who is free from such a trait to  ensure that the offspring do not suffer from this disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given  the extent of illiteracy, radio and television may prove more effective in  disseminating information on genetics than printed texts. We must learn from  the efficacy of advertising campaigns and use professionals to transmit our  messages to the populace.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  group generally felt that gene therapy is not yet at a stage where it can be  considered as a serious option in India.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Property rights</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Sandy Thomas, University of Sussex at Brighton, UK,</strong> pointed out that this issue  arose when countries decided to protect their indigenous material against  exploitation by others. Currently, it is necessary to ensure that there is  mutual benefit - to the country providing material and to the more advanced  country analysing it and providing the means for its exploitation world-wide.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whatever  the debates, DNA sequences have already been patented by individuals and  institutions in Japan and the USA. Most of these patents are concerned with the  use of these sequences in therapy, a few being related to diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					For  a country such as India to be able to compete in this field it will be  necessary to establish legislation providing rapid, simple and inexpensive  procedures for patenting and for making it easy for national organisations to  file and obtain national and international patents. There is little doubt that  the availability and respect for patents results in investment and stimulates  the economy. The downside, of course, is that for those patents that are held  abroad, you have to pay royalties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Debating  this issue, <strong>Dr. Vandana Shiva, Dehra Dun,</strong> argued against the  patenting of life forms. She also referred to ecopiracy of such substances as  neem and turmeric. The entire system of patenting was intended to encourage and  reward the individual researcher who would turn over his invention to the state  for public benefit. This has now been subverted such that it is the giant  corporations that reap the benefit after buying out the individual researcher  at a relatively low cost. She also referred to 'hedging patents' used to block  further research in that field. The topsy-turvy situation is best illustrated  by the fact that in times past, the sequence was from science to technology to  its commercialisation, whilst now it is in the reverse direction, commerce  dictating what technology is to be developed and science merely being allowed  to use that technology, at a cost.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Bioethics - education, awareness and dissemination</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr.  Darryl Macer. Eubios Institute, University of Tsukuba, Japan,</strong> described his very  informative survey of awareness of bioethics in high schools. (These have been  described in detail in the publication: Mater Darryl RJ, Asada Yukiko, Tsuzuki  Miho, Akiyama Shiro, Macer Nobuko Y: <em>Bioethics in high schools in  Australia, Japan and New Zealand</em>. Ibaraki, Japan: Eubios Ethics Institute  1996. p 194) The response to the carefully planned, detailed questionnaire lent  strong support to the view that it was necessary to teach students -- and their  teachers -- the ethical and social issues associated with science and  technology. The researchers also concluded that no teaching discipline has a  monopoly over the teaching of these issues. it is possible to include these  topics in every subject from biology and science to economics, geography and  history. An interesting finding was that some teachers taught bioethics even  though they were not required to do so. The survey elicited a large number of  requests for teaching materials in the form of fact sheets, videocassettes and  CD-ROMs. It was easiest for the team to send photocopies of what was available  on the Internet but they have, since, prepared and sent a host of other  material. An important lesson learnt was that bioethics could be used as a  means to foster respect for life. Students asked why it was necessary for them  to kill animals to learn biology when videocassettes could help them reach the  same goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Asis Datta, Vice- Chancellor, Jawaharlal Nehru  University (JNU), New Delhi,</strong> described his own survey that showed  ignorance of bioethics in undergraduates at his university. Whilst  postgraduates in biology were aware of genetic research, a minority (33%) were  conversant with the principles of bioethics. Postgraduates in branches other  than science fared just a little better than undergraduates.
				</p>
				<p>
					He  concluded that there was a need for innovative courses on bioethics in our  colleges. Designing a curriculum for such a course may not be easy, but an  interactive course with questions and answers might bear fruit. Courses should  also be designed and conducted during teacher training courses as are conducted  by the academic staff colleges, at the JNU and other universities.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. N. K. Ganguly, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education  and Research, Chandigarh,</strong> advocated  incorporation of bioethics in all biotechnology courses, He also advocated  incorporation of bioethics into courses on research methodology in all Ph. D.  and M. D. programmes with compulsory examinations in this subject. He favoured  the creation of regional teams of bioethicists who would tour institutions to  preach bioethics. Such an approach had worked when they were trying to  popularise oral rehydration therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Manju Sharma, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology,</strong> immediately volunteered  to set up a training programme in ethics for biomedical researchers.

					<strong>Dr. Marcus Palatnik</strong> felt that what was needed was 'a small amount  of information and a large amount of formation'. Analytical skills were also  important. He pointed out that education and morality are not always  companions. "Look for the person within the individual and help him become  a good citizen." In teaching bioethics, he advocated the use of the  history of medicine to demonstrate past problems and the ethical means by which  the masters solved them.

				<h4>A national consultative committee?</h4>
				<p>
					During the various discussions, the suggestion was made that a national  consultative committee be formed in India to regulate and oversee all work on  genetic research. Such a body could then draw up the necessary guidelines. This  committee must consist of distinguished and experienced research scientists,  medical doctors. nurses, representatives of industry, health administrators,  theologians, lawyers, members drawn from the educational profession and persons  from the media voicing public opinion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some  important questions will have to be resolved: Who will appoint such a committee  and fund it? To whom will such a committee report? How shall we ensure that  this committee is armed with teeth?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. David Shapiro, Nuffield Council, UK,</strong> suggested that the  committee be kept from the government, for the machinery of government is  machinery as machinery -- unthinking and unfeeling.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Nuffield Council was formed in the United Kingdom to deal with issues arising  out of biomedical research. Such bodies become necessary because society is not  willing to entrust politicians to make decisions on ethical and social issues,  or because politicians are unwilling to take on such responsibilities and  because legislation always linds it difficult to keep pace with changes in  science. It is up to such national consultative committees to enure full public  discussion ahead of legislation and produce well-considered guidelines. The  Nuffield Council is intended, primarily, to serve the public though it serves  scientists and the government as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  grand daddy of such committees is, of course, the US Presidential Commission.  In 1983, the French formed a committee with a difference -- it produces reports  only at the request of the government. In Denmark, in addition to producing  considered reports, the committee also produces excellent educational  programmes, which are brought before the public with the help of the media. It  also serves as a producer of consensus and feeds public opinion directly to  policy makers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is advisable to form a separate working party for the preparation of each  report. The Nuffield Council has one or two Council members, two scientists who  are in the lield and a lawyer on each working party.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Once  a report is produced, you need to stop it gathering dust." The committee must  ensure that the report is brought to the notice of the public, legislators and  policy makers. To a query on how guidelines help, he pointed out that in  Britain, if it is shown that a doctor acted within the guidelines laid down by  an agency such as the General Medical Council or agencies such as the Nuflield  Council, It is unlikely that any court will find the doctor guilty of  negligence. "It is the business of the Secretariat of the Council to make a  nuisance of itself by keeping the pressure on government and researchers to  ensure that guidelines are followed."
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Bryony Soper</strong> suggested that the committee should help  government develop foresight on what is to come. She also saw a role in research  into research, to ensure that it is relevant and cost-effective. It should also  ensure that research findings are transferred to clinical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  times there will be a host of authoritative bodies and experts voicing opinoins  on a given subject (such as cloning an animal). The committee can sift the  grain from the chaff and ensure that the community is adequately educated on  the subject especiallly on aspects of public concern, so that meaningful  debates, discussions and decision making could follow. Such debates must  involve a wide range of professionals and wise public figures so that there is  adequate understanding of the ethical and social implications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such  a committee should also be able to fight commercial interests not beneficial to  society and ensure that there is no bad legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Georges B. Kutukdjian, Director, Bioethics Unit, UNESCO,</strong> discussed the social and  human consequences of scientific discoveries and emphasised the need for  national and international standard setting bodies to safeguard human rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Mammen Chandy</strong> emphasised that if such a committee is seen  as a regulatory agency as well, it will be imperative for it to ensure that it  undertakes its tasks responsibly and acts within time frames essential to  effective functioning of laboratories in terms of service provided to patients  and research programmes.
