				<h4>Consequences of illegible prescriptions</h4>
				<p>
					Heard  the doctor who wrote a letter to his wife and she had to take it to the chemist  to have it read? Doctors have traditionally been known for their bad  handwriting. And danger lurks behind every such scrawl.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently  a US court slapped a heavy penalty on a doctor who wrote a prescription that  the druggist read wrongly, and gave the wrong medicine leading to the death of  a patient. In India, this is a situation just waiting to happen.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a private  nursing home in south Delhi, a doctor wrote a prescription for 'injection CP'  for chloramphenicol for typhoid. The nurse took it to mean chloroquin phosphate  for malaria, as a result of which the child suffered liver toxicity.

				<h4>Hospital refuses to release patient's papers</h4>
				<p>
					In  complete violation of a court directive on patient's rights, the cardiology  department of the government-run JJ hospital refused to release angiography  films of a 57-year-old patient who wants to get an angioplasty done in a  private hospital. When the patient asked Dr NB Bansal, associate professor of  cardiology at JJ, for the film to show it to a consultant, he was told it  belonged to the hospital. Claiming that the court order is being interpreted by  patients to suit their convenience, Dr Bansal said it is not binding on the  hospital to hand over the angiography film in this case. Asked why the hospital  wanted to keep the film, he said some material has to be retained for reference  in case the patient wanted to return for treatment.

				<h4>Surrogate grandchild?</h4>
				<p>
					The  parents of a 36-year-old man who died in a road accident are fighting a legal  battle to use their son's sperm to bear a child through a surrogate mother. The  hospital which took the man's sperm from his body before he died feels the the  parents' request lies outside the scope of the man's stated wishes for use of  his sperm after his death. The man's girlfriend has refused to have her dead  boyfriend's child.

				<h4>Testing for HIV without consent</h4>
				<p>
					A  GP in England who arranged for the blood of five patients to be tested for HIV  without their consent was found guilty of serious professional misconduct and  severely reprimanded by the General Medical Council.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  John Nicholls was also found guilty of failing to counsel the five about having  the test, and of failing to give adequate counselling to another patient whose  consent he had obtained.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  each case, the committee found that there was insufficient clinical indication  to justify testing the patients for HIV. One was seeking the emergency  contraceptive pill because she had been raped, and the others presented with a  range of problems including chronic sinusitis, which failed to respond to  antibiotics, concern about failure to gain weight, and oral thrush. All the  test results were negative.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several  of the patients told the GMC they were "shocked" to discover from Dr Nicholls's  partners in 1997 that blood samples taken from them had been tested for the  virus.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  practice came to light while Dr Nicholls was on holiday and another partner saw  the results of the blood test on Ms F, the patient with chronic sinusitis, in  his tray.

					The  majority of drugs given to children have not been tested for safety on  children, according to a study in England, Sweden, Germany, Italy and the  Netherlands. Two-thirds of the drugs prescribed to children were not licenced  for use in children or were used for purposes beyond that labelled --which can  mean a higher risk of adverse drug reactions.

				<h4>Made case studies without their consent</h4>
				<p>
					Shipped  out of two of Mumbai's biggest civic-run hospitals (Sion and KEM) in ambulances  in the dead of night, six patients were headed for an unknown destination. They  had been told they were being transferred to the trust-run Bombay Hospital for  reasons varying from a "medical conference" to "further investigations". What  they didn't now was that they were to be used as case studies for six post-graduate neurosurgery students, who were taking their practical examination at  Bombay Hospital's medical college. The patients are furious at the deception.  All six say their consent had not been taken to act as specimens. Najmuddin,  scheduled for surgery the next week to remove a brain tumour, was informed late  one night that he had to be transferred to Bombay hospital for 'further  investigations'." We became extremely worried as we thought he had suddenly  taken a turn for the worse," says his brother.
				</p>
				<p>
					All  the doctors interviewed agreed that consent was essential for such situations.  The dean of Bombay Hospital's institute of medical sciences where the exam was  conducted says there must have been a "communication gap".
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Keki Turel, professor and head of neurosurgery, Bombay Hospital and convenor of  the exam, insists that it is routine for patients to be transferred to a  medical college where an exam is underway. In any case, they were not  administered any treatment, nor were any invasive procedures carried out. It is  not his duty to apprise patients of the reason for their transfer; he is  responsible solely for conducting the exam.

				<h4>Regulation for gene therapy</h4>
				<p>
					Like  all risky medical research, better regulation is needed for gene therapy,said  Dr Arthur Caplan, professor and director of the Center for Bioethics at the  University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, USA, speaking at the New York  Academy of Sciences. A gene therapy experiment at the University of  Pennsylvania led to the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger who had an  inherited metabolic disorder.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  press hinted that researchers' ties to biotechnology companies might compromise  studies. Dr Caplan pointed out that such ties had been encouraged by federal  law for 20 years, to bring research efforts to the market place and benefit  patients. Almost all leading researchers had such ties.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The  area is rife with hypocrisy," said Dr Caplan, who enrolled in a clinical trial  himself and saw problems with incomplete information and coercion of subjects.  "The system is broken. It's been broken for a long time. It took gene therapy  to make it evident. Monitoring is non-existent. Adverse event reporting is a  joke."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Caplan recommended tougher monitoring, debriefing of at least five per cent of  study subjects by institutional review boards, random audits of institutions  conducting trials, and better coordination between data safety and monitoring  boards and institutional review boards to share information on adverse  outcomes. Finally, he suggested a "no fault" insurance fund to compensate for  medically related injuries instead of the current system of malpractice  lawsuits.

				<h4>Consumer courts take negligence seriously</h4>
				<p>
					A  child born at a private nursing home in Delhi is sent to another hospital where  it dies within a few hours of admission. A post-mortem reveals severe injuries  on the skull, chest and arms, apparently caused by the improper use of forceps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Harbans  Lal went to a doctor for treatment of a fractured arm &ndash; and ended up having to  have the arm amputated. The district consumer disputes redressal commision  found both doctor and hospital guilty of deficient services and fined them Rs  1.5 lakh and Rs 2,000 costs. When the doctor appealed to the state commission,  it was found that they were claiming to be bone specialists, when they were  neither registered nor qualified to practice allopathy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  court has ruled that consumer courts are competent to rule on deficiencies in  medical service from negligence, and the courts are taking such cases very  seriously.

				<h4>Amputation for a psychological disorder</h4>
				<p>
					In  Scotland, a surgeon amputated the legs of two men with a rare psychological  disorder known as apotemnophilia, in which patients believe they will be normal  only once a limb has been removed. Such patients often cause harm to themselves  to achieve this goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  surgeon operated after getting permission from the hospital's chief executive  and medical director, and after talking to his defence body and the ethics  committee of the General Medical Council. The patients went through a  psychological assessment and counseling beforehand. The surgeon, who did not  accept a fee for the surgery (the hospital was paid &pound;3000), said the patients'  lives had been transformed. "At the end of the day I have no doubt that what I  was doing was the correct thing for those patients."
				</p>
				<p>
					The  current chairman and board members of the trust which runs the hospital learnt  of the amputations only when the surgeon informed them that he was assessing a  third patient for the same procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  trust announced a temporary ban on further amputations. Such operations were  not ruled out, but a strict procedure would have to be followed.

				<h4>Pneumonia, not broken bones</h4>

					The  out patient department diagnosed him as an 'orthopaedic case', and the  orthopaedic surgeon thought he was an alcoholic. Chhotelal Ramlal Chauhan spent  the day being passed around in various departments of the civic-run Cooper  hospital in Mumbai, and the only treatment he got was a glucose injection and  some antacids. Within an hour of being sent back home, he collapsed and died.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  post-mortem examination revealed that the 20-year-old was suffering from  advanced pneumonia, which could have been picked up through a clinical exam and  a simple chest X-ray. He also should have been admitted immediately into the  hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ram  Vilas Yadav, a relative who works in the hospital, says poor patients are given  little if any treatment in this hospital. Dr S N Bhatia, in charge of municipal  peripheral hospitals, said she had ordered an inquiry into the case.

				<h4>HIV positive mother refuses drugs</h4>
				<p>
					Gill  Hickman decided to have a child despite knowing she is HIV positive.But what  will be even more difficult for many to comprehend is how this intelligent and  devoted mother declined to take an antiviral drug during pregnancy to reduce  the risk of passing on the infection to her unborn child. Drug therapy has been  shown to reduce (maternal-foetal HIV) transmission by about two thirds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ms  Hickman decided to become pregnant some years after she discovered she was HIV  positive. The hospital told her she had a one in seven chance of having an HIV  positive baby. When she became pregnant doctors, who were supportive of her  decision to have a child, offered her AZT, a common anti-viral drug. But she  refused to take it. "I... am a bit suspicious of drugs and their side-effects.  Also, I lived through the period when the Thalidomide babies were born, and I  just didn't want to put my baby at risk of anything.''
				</p>
				<p>
					Nor did Ms Hickman opt  for a Caesarean section, which is known to significantly reduce transmission of  the virus. She did, however, decide to bottle-feed. Breastfeeding has been  found to double the rate of transmission in the absence of other interventions.  (Women who opt for all three interventions-anti-HIV drugs, delivery by  Caesarean section and bottle-feeding-run a less than five per cent risk of  transmitting the virus to their child.) Tests have shown Malachai is HIV  negative.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ms Hickman is not the only HIV-positive mother to question drug  treatment. Last year an HIV-positive mother in the UK and her husband fled the  country when a court ordered that their four-month-old daughter be tested for  HIV against their wishes. Camden Council in north London had applied to the  court under the 1989 Children Act for an order to test the girl, believing that  if positive, she had a right to treatment. After researching the virus, the 33-year-old mother, who was breastfeeding her child, had become convinced that  scientists were wrong in believing that HIV was the sole cause of AIDS. She had  never taken any medication and claimed to be in perfect health. The judge did  not order her to stop breastfeeding.

				<h4>Private hospitals not for the poor</h4>
				<p>
					Despite  receiving government subsidies, many of Delhi's private and charitable  hospitals have failed to meet their obligations to poor patients. 'Critical  Condition', published by Workers' Solidarity, says the increasing dominance of  the private sector in health care and the trend to privatise charitable  hospitals have made health services inaccessible to the poor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The report is based  on a survey of wages, working conditions and terms of employment of Class IV  workers in eight of Delhi's largest private hospitals. "Though these hospitals  and institutes have received public benefits in the form of subsidised land,  tax deductions, import exemptions and donations, they have failed in providing  the stipulated free or cheap health services," said a spokesperson of Workers'  Solidarity. The report alleges that Apollo Hospital, in which the government  has a 26 per cent stake, keeps 200 beds meant for the poor mostly vacant, to  avoid spending money. The hospital has a long-term lease on 15 acres from the  DDA at the rate of just Re 1 a month.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apollo hospital's CEO said the hospital  had a special block for poor patients, who are referred by the government  hospitals. The report cites the general OPD in Moolchand hospital that was  given nine acres of prime land on Ring Road and a grant of Rs 3.5 lakh (after  Partition), as being wilfully allowed to deteriorate. The charge in a paid OPD  is as high as Rs 250 per visit.

				<h4>Doctor's services deficient</h4>
				<p>
					The  Consumer Court, Mumbai Suburban District, fined a doctor in Andheri Rs 4,000  (Rs 2,000 fine, Rs 1,000 refund of charges and Rs 1,000 court costs) for being 'deficient  in services' with 'outdated equipment.'
				</p>
				<p>
					The directions were passed by the  Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on a complaint filed by George Mathew against  Dr JT Shah of the Sandeep Clinic, Andheri (E). The doctor was on a panel of  physicians authorised to conduct medical tests for candidates selected for  employment in Saudi Arabia. In 1997, Mathew who was selected for a job there  approached Dr Shah for a medical certificate, underwent medical exams and paid  Rs 1,000 as fees. When he went to collect the reports the next day he was told  he had failed the test as he was HIV positive, but he was not given the test  report. Repeated tests elsewhere showed him to be HIVnegative, but the doctor  refused to accept the labs' findings, as a result of which Mathew lost a job  paying Rs 25,000 a month. Mathew filed a case in the consumer court, asking for  compensation of Rs eight lakh (later reduced to Rs 2 lakh ). Dr Shah argued  that the case was fabricated, and anyway was invalid since it was filed not by  Mathew but by his attorney. But the court found the doctor guilty and deficient  in service.

				<h4>Sorry, no drugs</h4>
				<p>
					Can  one of Mumbai's largest municipal hospitals run for three months without  syringes, surgical gear, cotton, drugs and even vitamins? The BYL Nair hospital  has pulled off the impossible. Even as it opts for a multi-crore makeover, it  admits patients to its 32 wards without drugs and surgical equipment. Marble  and ceramic tiles lie stacked all over as workmen renovate the premises. And  ward walls are covered with lists of 'out-of-stock' drugs The diabetic  patients department has no insulin injections, the trauma ward has no  nifedipine (a hypertension drug) and anaesthetists say stocks of neostigmine  (to revive anaesthetised patients) ran out long ago. Patients and relatives are  asked to buy the drugs themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remarks a resident at the OPD, "It is  stunning that the administration can afford such a makeover when patient care  is in jeopardy. Patients are asked to make their own arrangements for even  basic items like bandages, plaster and commonly available drugs. There have  been shortages earlier, but the situation has never been this bad. Some OPD  patients cannot afford the drugs and just leave to return in worse condition.  Except for the acting dean Dr HS Dhawale who admits to the shortage, the civic  authorities say all is hunky-dory. The additional municipal commissioner says  he is not aware of the situation. The municipal commissioner remarks: "The  beautification has nothing to do with the shortage, if any."

				<h4>Negligent gynaecologist</h4>
				<p>
					The  National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ordered Dr Mangla Bansod, a  Nagpur-based gynaecologist, to pay Vijay Mankar compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh  for her negligent handling of his wife's pregnancy, leading to her death.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  May 31, 1990, Dr Bansod prescribed medication to Lata Vijay Mankar when she  complained of discomfort at a check-up a week before her delivery date. She  was admitted in distress to Dr Bansod's nursing home that night, but was left  untreated for five hours before being taken into the labour room. The doctor  eventually came out to inform the family that the child had been delivered &mdash; also asked them to arrange blood for the mother. While this was being done,  Lata was shifted to a government hospital, without the relatives' consent. The  government hospital said she was dead on arrival. Dr Bansod claimed Lata died  because she had taken drugs prescribed by her doctor brother-in-law. After  recording the evidence of expert witnesses, the commission concluded that Dr  Bansod was negligent.

				<h4>Informed consent for postmortems</h4>
				<p>
					The  procedure for getting informed consent for postmortem examinations in the UK is  to be changed. The Royal College of Pathologists' guidelines require better  training of staff who must speak to relatives to allow postmortem examinations.  The impetus: parents of children at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, who died  following heart surgery, were not asked permission to retain the hearts from  the children after postmortem examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is hoped that the guidelines will  promote public support for postmortem examinations whose credibility has been  affected by the recent findings. In the past, doctors and pathologists rarely  discussed the details of postmortem examinations, and it was assumed that once  tissues had been lawfully obtained it was ethical to use them for research and  education purposes without asking for permission.
