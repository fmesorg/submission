				<p>
					Growing concern on ethics in research and medicine has prompted the  investigation into the need for a formal curriculum in the field of bioethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The survey conducted by Macer and co-workers  sought to identify the recognition, perception and inculcation of bioethical  values in high schools in Australia, Japan and New Zealand. Although an  impersonal form of survey (questionnaire) had been used without direct personal  contact; it is perhaps a telling comment on the state and awareness of this  concept that less than 50% replies (collectively) could be obtained, despite  reminders. This is a stark statement on the prevalent situation as the subjects  to whom these questionnaires were directed were teachers, who are instrumental  in shaping young minds and moulding their thought processes. In view of the  fact that biology and social studies teachers were contacted it is but natural  that animal experiments were the prime concern. The next most telling issues  concerned in vitro fertilisation, surrogate motherhood, prenatal diagnosis,  abortions, use of pesticides, genetic engineering and genetic manipulation in  plants and animals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use of animals in behavioural experiments as  well as in dissections is encountered in almost two-thirds of the schools from  which replies were received. The concerns voiced were similar, whether the  primary objective of education was achieved with animal experiments, whether  animals could be substituted by inanimate objects, whether observation in  nature can replace the experiments or a facility to return the animal to nature  could be implemented.
				</p>
				<p>
					A touching response was that it is sad to use  any kind of creatures for experiments, but the strength of the opinion weakened  for animals of lower order, from invertebrates downward to plankton. The concern  for vertebrates is more than that for invertebrates, and lesser still for the  lower order invertebrates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whereas it was deemed acceptable to carry out  genetic manipulation for increasing the yield of cash crops and increase the  yield of milk in cattle, respondents frowned upon attempts to harvest the rich  genetic pools of tribals of Afro-Asian nations. Perhaps optimal practice of  bioethics will finally imply treading the middle path of attempting to do the  best for the most rather than striving for the unattainable ideal.
