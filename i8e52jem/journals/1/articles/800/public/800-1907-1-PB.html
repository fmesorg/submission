					Since the first case of HIV infection was reported in India in 1986, AIDS has devastated the country with approximately four million cases currently <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National AIDS Control Organization.

					counselling.

				<p>
					Samraksha (a Bangalore-based non-governmental
					organisation) and ActionHealth (a UK-based charity)
					joined hands to form a Well Woman Clinic in 1997 <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baksi C M, Harper I, Raj M. A 'well woman clinic' in Bangalore: one strategy to attempt to decrease the transmission of HIV infection. International Journal of STD and AIDS 1998;9:418&ndash;23." id="6">(6)</a>.
					The clinic operates on a walk-in basis on two afternoons
					per week. Gynaecological examination, along with
					screening and treatment is done for gonorrhoea, and
					infection with Chlamydia and Trichomonas vaginalis.
					Each patient is then interviewed by a trained health
					advisor who discusses safer sexual practices and
					distributes condoms with detailed usage instructions.
					Management of partners is discussed and arranged, when
					appropriate. The emphasis is on risk reduction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solomon et al. have identified some factors that make
					Indian women vulnerable to HIV infection: the culture
					of silence surrounding women's sexuality, the willingness
					to risk acquiring HIV to conceive a child, and the inability
					to negotiate safer sex practices <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Solomon S, Buck J, Chaguturu SK, Ganesh AK, Kumarasamy K. Stopping HIV before it begins: issues faced by women in India. Nature Immunology. 2003;4:719&ndash;21." id="7">(7)</a>. Primary prevention
					delivered through routine clinical encounters thus offers
					a means of reaching out to a particularly vulnerable
					population.

				<h4>Community mobilisation</h4>
				<p>
					Another primary preventive intervention is more
					localised and aimed at mobilising community members.
					VISIONS Worldwide, Inc., formed in 1995, uses peer
					education to fight the spread of HIV infection among
					Indian youth who have the highest number of HIV
					infections <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National AIDS Control Organization. Surveillance for HIV infection/AIDS cases in India. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi, 2001." id="1">(1)</a> and lack AIDS awareness <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh S. Study of the effect of information, motivation, and behavioral skills intervention in changing AIDS risk behavior in female university students. AIDS Care 2003;15:71&ndash;6." id="8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ganguli SK, Rekha PP, Gupte N, Charan UA. AIDS awareness among undergraduate students, Maharashtra. Indian J Public Health. 2002;46:8&ndash;12." id="9">9)</a>. A delegation
					of US college students was trained and sent to India where
					they established local chapters in Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi. They conduct personalised risk assessment
					and counselling, dispel misconceptions about modes of
					transmission and enable behavioural modifications. The
					local chapters reach out to secondary schools to
					disseminate knowledge on HIV/AIDS. The message has
					been delivered to over 40,000 individuals. The efficacy
					of these interventions have not been formally evaluated.

				<h4>Ethical considerations</h4>
				<p>
					An international approach to responding to HIV/AIDS
					must acknowledge interdependence and, while providing
					aid, respect individual and national autonomy. By
					mobilising the community and individuals, it works
					towards sustainability. Passive global funding of
					treatment and prevention programmes falls short of such
					mobilisation. A national system of risk assessment and
					prevention counselling needs to be built into the primary
					health care system. Local community-based programmes
					that empower individuals need to be complementary to
					such an integrated system of primary health care.
