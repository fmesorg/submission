					In  September 2003, an international initiative was launched to treat 3 million  people living with HIV/AIDS by 2005-the 3-by-5 initiative. According to WHO  estimates, 95% of the 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) are in  developing countries. Less than 8% of those needing anti-retroviral therapy  (ART) receive it-compared with 84% in the West <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO/UNAIDS. Treating 3 million by 2005: making it happen: the WHO Strategy. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2003." id="1">(1)</a>. The Director General of WHO  described the lack of access to ART as 'a global health emergency' and  declared: 'To deliver anti-retroviral treatment to the millions who need it, we  must change the way we think and change the way we act.' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO/UNAIDS.

					The  3-by-5 initiative found its echo in India where there are an estimated 4.58  million PLHA as of 2002. On the World AIDS Day 2003, the Indian government  announced that from April 1, 2004 it would provide free ART in six high  prevalence states: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Manipur  and Nagaland. Later, the government added Delhi to the list, a low prevalence  state, due to its 'high vulnerability' <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Toufiq R.

The National AIDS Control  Organisation's (NACO) draft guidelines on the internet state that the first  phase would cover sero-positive mothers, sero-positive children below the age  of 15 years and people with AIDS seeking treatment in government hospitals. An  estimated 0.1 million patients would be covered by the end of 2005 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO).

					Two  factors are responsible for these major announcements. First, organisations of  PLHA all over the world have pressurised governments and international  organisations to recognise their right to treatment and care. Second, there is  a growing realisation of the economic and social impact of the HIV/AIDS  epidemic, as well as of its human rights implications. In fact, HIV/AIDS has  been responsible for orienting the public health community to human  rights-particularly the right to health.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The obligation to care  and treat</h4>
				<p>
					The medical profession has extensively practised discrimination against PLHA.  Hospitals test patients for HIV infection without their knowledge or consent,  without pre-test counselling contrary to national and international guidelines.  In the private sector, patients found to be HIV-positive are shunted to  government hospitals, discharged on some pretext or charged extra for treatment  with 'special protection'. In government hospitals, patients with HIV infection  are referred to the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) wards regardless of the  source of their infection. Some are refused emergency treatment while others  are isolated, thus making their HIV status public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly,  the private health sector has for long delivered ART to those who can afford  it, while also increasing its discriminatory practices. This makes one  sceptical of the claim that stigma and discrimination will reduce as treatment  options become available. More important, the government's programme commits to  cover only around 2% of PLHA. It is not clear how the technical guidelines and  medical criteria will make the selection of this 2% impartial. How can the  selection process be impartial and objective if the profession that is supposed  to implement it has shown discriminatory behaviour? The introduction of free  ART to a select few must be accompanied by the strict enforcement of the  fundamental obligation of health professionals' to treat patients without  discrimination.
				</p>

				<h4>Being just and seen to  be just</h4>
				<p>
					Justice and ethics are the casualties when political choices favour corporate  profit over patients' lives. Current policies pricing essential drugs out of  people's reach are responsible for the public health and ethical crises in  HIV/AIDS. The problem of justice is also evident at the micro-level of the new  policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clearly  the new ART strategy does not intend to cover all those needing treatment. PLHA  living in states other than the seven named are left out. Even within the seven  states, only certain categories are eligible. Unless the government explains  and justifies the logic of its policy, it faces an enormous ethical crisis. For  instance, Delhi's belated inclusion is not due to medical vulnerability but  political power.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  policy also needs to be seen as just, or what Norman Daniel describes as having  'perfect procedural justice'. If the states are selected on the basis of sound  public health logic, it must be strictly adhered to without giving in to  political exigencies.* The location of treatment facilities ought to be such  that physical access is easy. Ten of the 15 institutions identified in the NACO  guidelines are in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. This physical imbalance carries  forward the past unjust distribution of health services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  issue relates to the prevention of drug resistance due to poor adherence to the  treatment protocol and compliance to treatment. NACO needs to clarify whether  besides the medical selection criteria, there will be a value judgement of  patients who are best placed to comply with treatment. Further, the private  health sector has been irresponsible in the treatment of other communicable  diseases. Irrational prescription practices, discarding patients half-way  through the therapy when they run out of money, etc. have contributed to the  development of drug resistance. Since the private sector has long used ART and  will continue to use them, stringent regulation of its prescription practices  must be brought in the policy agenda. Without this, the policy will suffer  reversals, again jeopardising PLHA's right to treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is also the danger of corruption leading to the rejection of deserving patients  and the availability of 'free' treatment for a bribe.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Other health needs</h4>
				<p>
					Finally, just process demands an explanation of why people suffering from other  diseases-many of them life-threatening-should be made to pay in government  centres for drugs and user charges when ART will be freely available. The new  health policy and even the Common Minimum Programme of the new government has  promised that the government expenditure on health care will be increased from  0.8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) to over 2% of GDP. Just process  demands transparency about when it will be achieved and whether the increased  funding will go primarily for HIV/AIDS programmes or distributed fairly across  suffering patients of all types.
				</p>
				<p>
					For all  this, the medical ethics movement in India must make the connections between  ethics, human rights and public health and keep a sharp eye on this programme. This  will not only prevent its unethical implementation but also make the ethics  movement learn from public health and human rights concerns.
