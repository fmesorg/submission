					A recent news item reported on the Indian Medical Association's decision to endorse the Tropicana brand of fruit juices and Quaker brand of oats. The director of the Centre for Science and Environment, Sunita Narain, has objected to the association's actions, calling them "advertisement tricks" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Times News Network.

					If we look at the world scenario, the logo of the British Heart Association appears on Tetley tea and the World Heart Federation logo appears on Kellogg's bran flakes. Muller Crunch Corner yoghurt carries the logo of the National Osteoporosis Society. Ribena Tooth Kind states that its drink is "the only drink accredited by British Dental Association".

					The American Medical Association (AMA) paid Sunbeam Corporation US$ 9.9 million to avoid a suit for breach of contract when the company pulled out of a five-year, multi-million-dollar endorsement deal. The AMA was to endorse Sunbeam's blood pressure monitors, humidifiers and other products, but the association withdrew from the deal after being criticised because it had no plans to test the products. The chief executive of the AMA resigned following protest over this case <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="SoRelle R.

Brand endorsement, popularity and event sponsorship as advertisement cues affecting consumer. J of Advertising 1999 Sep 22. [cited 2008 Jun 13].

				<h4>Ethics for doctors</h4>
				<p>
					When medical associations endorse a product, they violate the Medical Council of India's 2002 regulations <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 and MCI notification 2002 Apr 06. [cited 2008 Jun 13]. Available from: http://www.expresshealthcaremgmt.com/20020531/focus1.shtml." id="16">(16)</a> regarding professional conduct, etiquette and ethics for registered medical practitioners. The regulations specify that a physician shall not give to any person, whether for compensation or otherwise, any approval, recommendation, endorsement, certificate, report or statement with respect to any drug, medicine or any commercial product for use in connection with his name, signature or photograph in any form or manner of advertising through any mode.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic objectives of clinical associations are to promote medical science, and improve public health and medical education. Are the honour and dignity of the association not being tarnished when it accepts money to endorse a particular brand? If the brands are medicines, their efficacy should be proved by clinical trials and the results published. Advertisements for products with endorsements contain a line to the effect that results are not "100 per cent proven". Many of these products are cosmetics or food supplements that are being sold under the garb of medicine to escape heavy taxes - the so-called "nutraceuticals" and "cosmeceuticals", which have no meaning in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act or in the Food and Drugs Administration.
				</p>
				<p>
					A medical association's name and emblem are its pride. Using them for monetary gain is like selling the association for a price. Medical associations do not have the authority to dispense seals of endorsement, recognition or approval. It is not acceptable them to sell these even if it is argued that the amount received is put to good use. We should have a ban on all medical association endorsements and action should be taken against those who violate medical ethics. Let the glory of medical associations shine through their work on promoting health and not as commercial advertisers.
