  <p>Based on my experience of 20 years in  urban general practice I would like to present the following thoughts regarding  the declining ethical values in medical practice. I will initially make some  general points and then focus on family practice. I believe that the root cause  of differing standards of medical practice can often be traced back to the  criteria for selection of medical practice as a career. A young student  selects the medical profession for various reasons, which ultimately influence  his or her attitude towards medical practice. These reasons include: aptitude,  dedication and capability; parental pressure, sensing a money-making  opportunity and wanting 'family business' to continue. Only a person  falling in the first category, who has chosen to become a doctor out of a  certain commitment to serve society, is able to enjoy his life, work with  dedication and emerge wiser towards the end of his career. He or she may  contribute substantially to society (irrespective of his 'achievements') Any  other person without dedication and aptitude is not able to achieve the  'target' and may develop resentment towards life and society. He may use  his position to gain power, status or money. Unfortunately a significant  number of doctors in today's society are from the latter group</p>
  <p>Our colleagues should realise that looking at their  practice only from the money-making angle, in the long term makes them lose  both money and skills. I believe that excessively money-minded  individuals often lose sight of the core issue, which in our case is the  treatment of patients. No doubt money is important in today's  world, but doctors should not expect to earn like industrialists who can employ  many people and run their production three shifts per day. We should focus on  our main objective, our patients' interest, which will not only earn love and  respect for us but will eventually become financially rewarding as well.</p>
  <p>On a more pro-active level, we could take the  initiative in promoting interaction with society. For example doctors from a  locality should also form groups which, acting as 'watchdogs', assist law-enforcing  and medical authorities. Medical councils should encourage ethical values and  enforce carefully thought-out and frequently up-dated rules, so that the  medical community on the whole continues to be respected by society. We must  actively vote for the right candidates in medical council elections On the  other hand, society should discourage 'ambulance-chasing' lawyers and  'trial-by-press' against doctors. Demoralised doctors may not be in the  interests of society. High-school curricula should contain a small chapter in  the civics textbook on how to select and deal with professionals. Students  should be made to realise that intrinsic values should be given emphasis  while selecting professionals, not their 'appearance'. Society should not always  expect doctors to act as selfless, dedicated souls. Unless proper fees  are paid, doctors will either indulge in malpractices or remain relatively poor  - and neither situation will be healthy for society. A ban on advertising by  doctors should continue, because otherwise a doctor's worth will always be  decided by marketing men. At the same time, media persons should reduce  the publication of unnecessary articles written by publicity-hungry doctors.</p>
  <p>From the specific viewpoint of general practice, I  would like to share my own experiences, which I believe have helped me practice  ethically and at the same time be content with what I am doing.</p>
  <p>General practitioners (GPs) should always try to  purposefully interact with patients of all age-groups. The relationships which  they build over time will be useful and will bring long-lasting satisfaction to  him. The goodwill which they so gather, should be used for guiding their  patients towards the path of recovery from their illness. They must always put  across the pros and cons of a particular treatment to their patients. A  consenting patient will then be more co-operative while undergoing treatment.  Patients who do not want to listen to professional advice may not come again,  but a practice built up in a straightforward way later brings rich dividends in  the form of satisfaction and respect.</p>
  <p>GPs must always charge and get appropriate fees,  but in certain cases may give credit facilities. A carefully given credit  facility is usually not misused. Moreover, the same patient may not hesitate to  come if he has fallen ill but has no money at that time.</p>
  <p>GPs should be very careful in issuing various  certificates and one of the reasons for our low credibility is the practice of  easily issuing certificates on demand. GPs should not give injections except  when unavoidable. However, using injections such as placebos should be allowed  in certain situations. No drug should be used indiscriminately (for example,  appropriate antibiotics should be prescribed only for documented or strongly  suspected bacterial infections). The GP's prescription should be precise,  clearly written and properly explained to the patient.</p>
  <p>GPs should always refer their patients to a  competent diagnostic centre. I have come across X-ray clinic where reports are  regularly written by technicians. I have also come across a pathologist who  would always print 'QNS' (quantity not sufficient) across the specific gravity  column of the routine urine examination report, irrespective of the amount of  urine given by the patient, and another pathologist who would never give RBC  indices even when a complete haemogram was ordered.</p>
  <p>I strongly believe that general practitioners must  continuously update their knowledge. In the field of medicine, concepts,  clinical course, treatment, etc., keep changing even as new diseases like AIDS  come up. GPs who have to cover a wide range of topics are therefore very  precariously placed. They must keep abreast of these changes because they are  the first doctor to whom the patient comes, and if they do not suspect a  potentially dangerous disease in time, it may be too late for the patient.</p>
  <p>General Practitioners should always keep a small  percentage of their earnings aside for buying medical books. They also should  not be ashamed to open and refer to them in the presence of the patient, in  case of any doubt. They should also attend various updating programmes where  lecturers are consultants who speak from their experience. They should avoid  attending updating programmes which are in fact 'social events' combined with  entertainment programmes (complete with lucky draws). Sponsors of scientific  programmes should provide relevant study material as gifts instead of other  useful things (which GPs will be inclined to buy anyway). Alternatively, GPs in  small effective groups should make their own study programme, invite  experienced specialists and gain knowledge out of them. GPs should always use  the opportunity of visiting their patients in the hospital to study their  cases.</p>
  <p>A patient should be referred only if it is beyond  the capacity (skill/facility) of the GP to treat. The referral should be made  as transparent as possible, giving the patient a right to go to the specialist  of his choice. If the GP has referred a patient to a consultant, then track  should be kept on the patient's progress. He should insist on being informed  prior to taking any major decision and should make it very clear to the  attending consultant that appropriate treatment for his patient is all that he  wants from him. Concessions should be demanded and obtained for poor patients.</p>
  <p>In the ultimate analysis, a doctor who can take  care of both the emotional and medical aspects of his patients is best suited  to join general practice. Also, the only way to improve medical ethics would be  to improve the ethics of society itself. I remember a stock-broker  becoming a hero overnight for making an illegal fortune out of the  stock-market a few years ago. In a society that worships such  people, it may be a long time before we can expect the ethics of medical  practice to improve.</p>
