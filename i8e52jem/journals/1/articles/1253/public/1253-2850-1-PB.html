					Conventionally one conceptualises the research
					relationship as one between two sets of free agents
					&mdash; researchers and participants &mdash; who may have
					different levels of control over the research process.
					However, conducting research on women inevitably absorbs
					into the interaction several other players without whose
					assent women may not act.
					It is true that every researcher and participant is entangled
					in a network of power relations as funders, the state,
					employers, landlords and others influence the direction and
					scope of research and the actions of researchers and
					participants. However, they usually influence the direct
					players as a class, and can be engaged with as a class
					(participants may collectively ignore a ban imposed by the
					employer, or on entire village may boycott a survey). In the
					case of women, however, each individual woman must
					negotiate her participation, with her own household, as must
					the researcher. Researchers are usually caught between
					legitimising the authority of men or older women to dictate
					the actions of women, and ignoring or resisting their control
					at the risk of retaliation.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Negotiating with authority figures</h4>
				<p>
					Both women participants and researchers build alliances with
					men. Women involve strategic male members in the research
					process to protect themselves from possible danger posed
					by researchers. Researchers may use men to legitimise their
					authority, gain access to women, ensure their safety, and
					preclude possible disruption or opposition.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, men's involvement also introduces
					complications. The research process then involves a
					continuous process of negotiation and bargaining, in which
					the women participants are particularly vulnerable. And for
					either group, this strategic move foregrounds patriarchal
					subordination and reinforces the existing power structure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Lack of autonomy and research priorities</h4>
				<p>
					In the context of women's health research, another important
					issue relates to the relevance and control of knowledge.
					Women have suffered as much as they have benefited from
					social research. Much health research has concentrated on
					improving acceptance of an undemocratic contraception
					programme, and effecting behaviour change among
					disempowered sex workers and poor mothers. Family
					planning, safe sexual behaviour and more informed childrearing
					practices are meaningful only in a context where
					women can exercise their free will. Research which aims to
					change women without changing their context is not relevant
					unless it examines the pressures and constraints that may
					prevent women from acting in ways beneficial to themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women also have very control over researchers'
					knowledge. They have very limited access to education, they are often unable to travel far from their homes and too
					intimidated to enter offices. Researchers' legitimacy is partly
					because they can speak a language comprehensible to those
					in power. They are thus able to speak for women. On the
					other hand, without education, women do not possess the
					means of using the knowledge they have helped produce. It
					must be debated whether the research community does not
					have an ethical responsibility to bridge the knowledge gap
					between participants and themselves.
				</p>
				<p>
					This relates to both the politics and the ethics of research.
					Participants who gain access to the written word could judge
					what is produced on them, and also counter the monopoly
					of researchers to speak for them. This may fundamentally
					alter relationships between researchers, policy makers and
					the community, and compel us to heed women's voices.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is against this general background that I reflect on the
					experiences of a research study conducted while working in
					a structured research organisation. I describe the ethical
					dilemmas which emerged, and our attempts to resolve them.
				</p>

				<h4>Household survey on women's health</h4>
				<p>
					In 1996, we conducted a household survey in Nasik district
					to document illness, utilisation of health care and health
					expenditure. Although information was collected on all family
					members, there was a specific focus on women. We
					introduced probing (a list of symptoms) to record morbidity
					that is perceived but not reported. The team consisted of
					women investigators between 18 and 25 years, research
					assistants and three researchers. Our investigators were
					living in Nasik and Bombay and had 10-12 years of formal
					education. Their fathers/husbands were industrial workers,
					petty traders or in the lower rungs of the service sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The survey covered rural areas of Igatpuri taluka and Nasik
					city. The households selected represented a cross section
					of the population of the district. In the rural phase, researchers
					visited the selected villages, established contact with the
					local leaders and women in the community. We also
					conducted key informant interviews with women and men in
					the villages. This initial visit was also used to fix the time
					and date of the survey. The gap between the researchers'
					first visit and the team's arrival was sufficient for news of
					the survey to spread by word of mouth. In almost all villages,
					we also held a public meeting for women in the balwadi,
					samaj mandir or temple to give information about the study,
					its objectives, the date and the process involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					This process continued simultaneously with data
					collection. Thus, while the survey was going on in one
					village, the researchers would establish contact in the next
					village. Often, women from one village would have natal
					homes in the next sampled village. This network of
					relationships was useful in reaching out directly to women
					and households without the mediation of the established
					local leadership.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each interview took an hour and a half, which included the
					time spent by investigators to introduce themselves and the study. A pamphlet with key information &mdash; on the
					organisation, research objectives, the planned use of data
					and the rights of participants (to confidentiality, to withdraw
					from the survey and to refuse to answer specific questions)
					and researcher's and coordinator's names &mdash; was signed by
					the researchers and the co-ordinator, read out and given to
					the respondent prior to the interview.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only difference in the urban areas was that no
					community meetings were held in the clusters of bungalows
					and apartment blocks. Each household was approached
					individually.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Issues</h4>
				<p>
					Typically, surveys concern communities rather than
					individuals and hence in this study too, we approached the
					'community' before starting the survey. The idea was to
					obtain 'informed consent', not merely from individual
					respondents, but also from the community. However, it is
					difficult to define what constitutes the community's consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					We resolved this problem by holding public meetings prior
					to the survey where we explained the nature of the survey,
					its objectives, the method of sampling and the interview.
					We took care to ensure that more than half of the participants
					in these meetings were women. We also held as many
					meetings as required to ensure the participation of women
					of all the identifiable groups in that community (including
					dalits, the different tribal groups, minority communities and
					migrants) We invited questions in these meeting and clarified
					doubts. The community meeting was a way of indicating
					that we recognised the existence of the collective apart from
					individual women, and were also accountable to the
					collective. A meeting is a public space where women felt
					more secure in raising doubts because they could rely on
					other women for support. It also indicated that we were willing
					to face them as a group. If we felt that the group was not
					convinced or that they had not entirely grasped the
					information, we held another meeting just prior to the survey.
					If we sensed insurmountable opposition to the exercise we
					did not conduct the survey in that particular community.
				</p>
				<p>
					The consent of elected representatives and local leaders
					was also sought, for both ethical and pragmatic reasons.
					However, at no point did we use their consent as a proxy for
					the consent of the actual participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					In two instances, in spite of the exhortations of the
					sarpanch to conduct the survey, we did not do so because
					we surmised that the actual respondents did not want it.
					When we examined why an entire community refused to
					participate in the survey, we found that in both cases, the
					women were particularly vulnerable within their own
					communities. While in one village, there were numerous
					widows whose husbands had died while foraging for scrap
					metal in the ammunition range, the women in the other village
					were left to fend for themselves in the absence of their men
					who spent most of the year working as contract labourers in
					the city.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among other significant issues relating to this research
					study was the relationship between the main researchers
					and the investigators. It was understood that unless
					investigators had internalised the research methods and objectives, they would not be able to do justice to the study.
					So they were trained rigorously, especially with the intention
					of making them sensitive to the issue and receptive to women.
					Although the training equipped our team intellectually and
					ideologically, we had not anticipated the emotional burden
					that investigators would have to carry. The survey was a
					large-scale exercise involving a team of 20 people and
					considerable material resource. The pace of work was guided
					by logistics as well as the imperative to interview all the
					households within the same season. Thus, as the survey
					progressed the pace became more and more punishing as
					we attempted to make up for unforeseen delays.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each pair of investigators encountered four to five
					households and met 10-12 women a day. Each day brought
					its store of traumatic stories of death, suffering and loss.
					Women broke down and it was not unusual for the
					investigators to join them. Even the most experienced
					investigator found herself getting involved in the lives of
					the woman she interviewed. As the team leaders it was our
					duty to keep the work moving. Often, we had to goad
					reluctant investigators out of one house and into the next.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fear was not merely that precious time would be lost
					but also that the investigators would spend enormous
					amounts of physical and emotional energy generating
					information that we could not use. Our investigators
					justifiably got angry at our attempts to put the research
					above the natural impulse to listen, console and counsel.
					The brevity of the contact itself became the source of much
					distress. The result was bouts of skepticism about the
					exercise and a reluctance to continue working in this way.
					Things were not made easier by the fact that investigators
					continuously faced questions from participants about was
					to be gained by this exercise. While they had been trained
					to explain the long-term objective of gender-sensitive
					research, they often did not believe their own answers.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the third or fourth week of field-work, all the stories
					sounded vaguely familiar. It was necessary to evolve a way
					out that would allow us to continue working without feeling
					burnt out, and also preserving the honesty of our responses.
				</p>
				<p>
					We therefore institutionalised the evening team meeting,
					to be held in any private place, at our Nasik headquarters, in
					the jeep or at a restaurant on the way back. The meeting
					would take stock of the work accomplished and the problems
					encountered. The investigators spent hours relating what
					various women had told them and what they had experienced
					themselves. The meetings helped us release pent-up
					frustrations and articulate our anger and helplessness. We
					realised how important it was for even the most junior
					researcher to be able to distance herself from the issue and
					view it within a perspective.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of us also brought our share of personal problems that
					made the field-work even more difficult. This space was used
					to resolve those issues. The meetings were never entirely
					professional, but involved a lot of personal sharing of
					physical contact, of expressions of concern and affection
					as well as annoyance and irritation. It is largely on account
					of these meetings that we were able to complete the survey
					successfully and divert some of our frustration creatively
					into writing field-notes and diaries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from the ethical issue of exposing juniors in the team
					to experiences that they may not have been prepared for,
					the larger issue relates to the relationship between
					researchers. One recognises the need for role differentiation
					and hierarchy in the research team. However, it is still
					important to ask why certain ways of writing legitimise
					research more than others. This is particularly relevant in
					women's research where qualitative techniques are used
					extensively and sensitive issues are probed in detail. The
					richness of the data lends much to the quality of the research,
					and investigators and assistants who conduct the actual
					interviews and group discussions are very important players.
					Their sensitivity, understanding of the issue and skill are
					pre-conditions for good data collection. Not only are they
					involved intensively in this phase of the research, a
					participatory mode of functioning may actually equip them
					with additional skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our own experiences indicated that the meetings and
					discussions imparted certain skills to investigators that are
					normally associated with research writing. They learnt how
					to abstract, generalise and analyse situations from what we
					would understand as a 'sociological' point of view. Their
					writing skills were poor because of their level of education,
					but these skills can be acquired with effort and inputs. While
					our investigators may have been too junior and ill-equipped
					to manage all phases of research, investigators with more
					formal education and training may become capable of doing
					research independently and competently. It is important that
					designation does not define roles, and space is created for
					junior members to share in the writing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are our institutions open enough to absorb people who
					may raise themselves from below? This issue is distinct from
					sharing research with participants, as is the norm in
					'participatory research' where they have a say in designing
					the methodology and the conduct of the research as well as
					in the use of it. While participants share the gains of the
					research largely through changes which result in the
					community after the research (such as an improvement in
					the PDS), junior researchers could share the professional
					gains and prestige associated with research. It would involve
					changing the policies of institutions and implementing
					measures that seriously challenge existing institutional
					hierarchies. The material gains too would be distributed and
					serious questions would be posed about the social structure
					of research organisations and the class structure that they
					reflect.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					While some of these issues are gender specific, some are of
					a general nature. The teams involved resolved the ethical
					dilemmas by responding to problems, as they arose evolving
					a consensus through discussion and self-reflection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus we must debate whether the household's consent
					can be accepted as the woman's consent. Likewise, gain
					accruing to the household may not necessarily amount to
					gain accrued to the woman. Where most women are illiterate,
					sharing the knowledge with the community in a written form
					in front of the elders and community leaders may, in fact,
					expose women without benefitting them. What will women
				</p>
				<p>
					do with knowledge that they are not empowered to use? In
					a situation where vulnerable women seek the intervention
					of others, what stand should we take when they try to set
					up a system of checks and balances between the researcher
					and the authority figures, who are conventionally bound to
					protect them? By accepting their legitimacy, one
					automatically endorses their right to share the knowledge
					resulting from the research. Does this compromise our
					commitment towards women who are the rightful recipients
					of that knowledge? How does one then confront the same
					authority figures?
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, one must address the problems within. An
					important agenda for women's studies has been to widen
					the definition of knowledge and challenge norms governing
					the hierarchy of knowledge. However, as women's studies
					get recognised and institutionalised, new hierarchies are
					being established in new institutions. Research in women's
					issues, especially women's health is not confined to activist
					groups and dissidents among the academic community. Apart
					from the state, which continues to conduct research on
					women, there are large research institutions in the
					mainstream, large non-governmental organisations and multilateral
					agencies, many of whom claim to be conducting
					research with women. These agencies are spread across a
					wide ideological spectrum. Nonetheless, is it sufficient to
					claim that women participants are partners? What about the
					woman research investigator (who also forms the informal
					sector of the research industry, indispensable and yet highly
					substitutable), who should legitimately share the direct gains
					of research, both material and social?
