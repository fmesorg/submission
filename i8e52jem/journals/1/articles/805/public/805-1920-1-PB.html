					Female  sterilisation is the mainstay of contraceptive methods in India. Every year  over four million female sterilisation operations are conducted in the country.  Like all surgical procedures, female sterilisation, despite being a relatively  low-risk procedure, has its attendant risk and failure rates. According to  international authorites, the failure rate, i.e. the chance of becoming  pregnant after the operation is around one in 200, the rate of complication  around one in 100 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rotimi AK, Eedarapalli P. Female Sterilisation. Available from URL: http://www.sexualhealthmatters.com/v2iss2/article4.html (accessed on June 18, 2004)." id="1">(1)</a>, and the risk of death around three in 100,000 procedures <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapron C, Querleu D, Bruhat MA, et al. Surgical complications of diagnostic and operative gynae-cological laparoscopy: a series of 29,966 cases. Hum Reprod 1998;13:867-72." id="2">(2)</a>. According to these estimates, there is a possibility of over 20,000  failures, 20,000 women with complications and about 150 deaths due to these  operations. However, there are no specific provisions for dealing with these  acceptable risks within the programme.

					Healthwatch  UP Bihar is an advocacy network on women's health and rights in four  states&mdash;Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttranchal and Jharkhand&mdash;which originally  comprised UP and Bihar. Healthwatch UP Bihar is actively involved in tracking  the changes in the delivery of the state family planning programme after the  adoption of the Target Free Approach and after the Reproductive and Child  Health Programme <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healthwatch UP Bihar. Voices from the ground. Lucknow: Healthwatch UP Bihar, 1999." id="3">(3)</a>. The state unveiled its population policy in July 2000 and  this policy had a set of escalating annual targets that ranged from 600,000 to  1.2 million cases per year. While reviewing the policy directives, members of  the network came across a large number of cases of sterilisation failures,  complications and deaths <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Healthwatch UP Bihar. Priorities of the People. Lucknow: Healthwatch UP Bihar, 2002." id="4">(4)</a>. Site visits to sterilisation camps revealed that  bicycle pumps were being used to introduce air into the abdomen for  laparoscopic ligation <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Saxena R.

				<h4>Public  interest litigation for ensuring quality of care in sterilisation services</h4>
				<p>
					The Department of Family Welfare of the Government of India had prepared a  manual of standards in the case of female and male sterilisation <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Standards for male and female sterilisation. Division of Research Studies & Standards, Department of Family Welfare, MOHFW, Government of India, 1999." id="6">(6)</a>. The  quality of care in 10 sterilisation camps was documented using these standards.  It revealed that most of the standards were not being followed. The average  operating time was between two and five minutes for laparoscopic ligation.  Against the prescribed limit of 20 operations per team per day, teams were  found to perform 75 operations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using  the Healthwatch UP Bihar and another study as evidence, and the Department of  Family Welfare guidelines as the basis, a public interest litigation (PIL) was  filed in the Supreme Court by Healthwatch UP Bihar under Article 32 of the  Constitution. The PIL (Writ Petition (Civil) No 209 2003) was admitted and the  Supreme Court asked all states and union territories to file their affidavits.  The Supreme Court gave its order to states in May 2003 and since then only  seven states and union territories have filed their affidavits. These include  Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar islands, Sikkim,  Manipur, Haryana and Orissa. Except for Haryana, none among these have  acknowledged that there are any cases of failure, complication or death and  have solemnly sworn that all procedures are following the standards. Haryana  has been the sole exception because of the well-known Santara case <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Supreme Court in State of Haryana v. Santra [(2000) 5 Supreme Court Cases 182]." id="7">(7)</a> where  the government had to pay compensation for the failure of a case of tubectomy.

					It is  interesting to note that a performance audit by the Comptroller and Auditor  General (CAG) on the National Family Wefare Programme in 2001 reported that  nine states had reported 762 failures and no investigations had been carried  out to establish the reasons for the failure. A five-district study in Uttar  Pradesh conducted in 1999 had reported a failure rate of 4.7% which would  amount to over 15,000 failures in that state alone <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="State Innovations for Family Planning Services Agency (SIFPSA).

				<h4>Quality  of care, ethics and law in the case of sterilisation</h4>
				<p>
					Sterilisation campaigns have been in the centre of controversies. Forced  sterilisations in Nazi Germany, in the US in the early 1940s and the  Sterilisation Act of Sweden are well-known cases of human rights violations.  There were forced sterilisations during the Emergency in India too. However,  after the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo 1994),  family planning programmes have supposedly become more development-centred and  women friendly. India too has changed its policies and programmes through the  adoption of the National Population Policy (NPP 2000), the Reproductive and  Child Health Programme (1997) and the Community Needs Assessment Approach  (1999). In the wake of these changes, the findings of the two studies raise a  number of legal and ethical questions regarding the conduct of individual operations,  mass sterilisation camps as well as programme design and accountability.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are close relationships between quality of care, ethics and legality. While  quality of care can be considered to relate to technical aspects, ethics relate  to the moral responsibility and law binds with legal accountability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sterilisation  operations are non-therapeutic procedures and therefore warrant extra care and  caution <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Margaret AS. Therapeutic and non-therapeutic medical procedures&mdash;what are the distinctions? Health Law in Canada 1981;2:85-90." id="9">(9)</a>. The ethical responsibility of the practitioner is more in the  case of non-therapeutic operations because it is possible to cause harm to  someone who did not have a problem to start with. Many women undergo tubectomy  as a result of the subtle pressures of health workers and the absence of  knowledge and access to other services. The ethical considerations in the case  of female sterilisation have more than one dimension. First, one has to  consider the manner in which women are recruited for the procedure. While this  is the responsibility of paramedics and outreach workers, it is finally the  responsibility of the team headed by the operating surgeon to ensure that all  medical eligibility criteria and ethical (informed consent) requirements have  been met. The operating surgeons must ensure that the minimum acceptable  technical standards are met. Besides, women who come to camps deserve to be  treated with dignity. The author's experience at the camps shows that a heavily  sedated woman is picked up roughly and dumped on the operation table. In the  operation theatre, there is little concern for the woman's privacy and at the  end of the operation she is picked up and dumped outside equally  unceremoniously with little concern for post-operative care. As a programme of  high national priority, the family planning programme owes the women who agree  to undergo sterilisation operation, minimum respect and quality services and  medical personnel associated with these camps need to ensure this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors  often justify the shoddy treatment of women at sterilisation camps by referring  to the pressure of targets that they have to fulfil or the lack of time. This  is a dilemma that doctors must resolve at the personal level as well as through  professional organisations such as the Indian Medical Association and  Federation of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists Societies in India. The  accountability to the employer (the government) in terms of the various  pressures has to be balanced against the ethical responsibility towards the  individual patient. Besides ethical principles, the consequences of poorly  conducted operations have legal dimensions as well. Indian courts have admitted  cases of tubectomy failure and deaths and have taken steps to compensate women both  for medical negligence and fixed accountability of the state for negligence of  the doctor in cases of failure <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Supreme Court in State of Haryana v. Santra [(2000) 5 Supreme Court Cases 182]." id="7">(7)</a> as well as tubectomy deaths <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa v. State of Maharashtra, 1996 Acc CJ 505 : (AIR 1996 SCW919)" id="10">(10)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  time that the simple tubectomy operation is examined more closely not only  because it is perhaps the most widely conducted surgical procedure in India but  also because this major surgical procedure, if improperly performed, has the  potential to cause harm.
