				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					New entrants are vulnerable to the challenges of the   medical course; mentoring programmes are known to offer support.   This paper evaluated the experiences of students and faculty   enrolled in a new mentoring programme. After needs analysis of   students and faculty, a small-group mentoring programme for new   medical students was initiated. Fifty-five volunteer faculty   mentors were allocated two-three students each. At year-end, feedback   using an open-ended questionnaire, revealed that there was no   contact in one-third of the cases; the commonest reasons cited were lack   of mentee initiative, time and commitment. Supportive mentors   were appreciated. Over 95% of respondents believed that   mentoring was a good idea; many believed the mentee benefitted;   mentors also reported improved communication and affective skills;   60 (77.0%) mentees wanted to mentor new students the   following year. Thus, mentoring of first-year students by faculty was effective, when contact occurred, in making the mentee feel   supported. Mentoring may be a means of honing the affective domain   and humanitarian instincts of medical faculty and students.

After conducting a needs analysis amongst students and faculty we designed a small-group mentoring programme for new medical students joining the institution in 2009. The goal of the programme was to provide new entrants with an immediate support network. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the experiences of students and faculty at the end of the first year of the programme, with particular reference to the quality of interactions.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					In February 2009, in anticipation of the batch of new medical students that would be admitted in August 2009, a needs assessment was conducted among faculty and students. After institutional ethics committee approval, all faculty members who attended a faculty meeting were requested to complete a questionnaire on the need felt for a student mentoring programme at the institution. Likewise, students from all semesters were requested to fill in their perceptions on the need for such a programme. Twenty-four of 30 (80%) faculty members who responded, and 258 of 264 (97.7%) students, felt that formal student mentoring should be initiated in the institution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequent to the felt need, faculty volunteers were solicited through posters, through the Medical Education Unit website, and through a formal letter to all departments. Once the list of first semester students admitted in 2009 was available to the academic section of the institution, formal allotment of volunteer faculty mentors was made for all 150 students. On the day they joined, students were handed a letter of welcome that informed them of the mentoring programme, its expected advantages, and the name and contact details of their faculty mentor. Students' contact details were passed on to the respective faculty mentor by e-mail. The faculty and students were advised to visit the website of the Medical Education Unit, where details of the expected roles of mentors and mentees were posted. Additionally, both were advised to communicate difficulties, if any, to the authors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, in July 2010, before the next batch joined, mentors and mentees were requested to complete an open-ended questionnaire on their experience with the mentoring programme. The questionnaire was derived from several available in the literature <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Planning Commission of British Columbia. Mentorship program evaluation form. 2010 Jul[cited 2013 Mar 28].Available from: http:// www.pibc.bc.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/PIBC-Mentoring-Program- Evaluation-July2010.pdf" id="17">(17</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Virginia Commonwealth University.

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					A small-group mentoring model was designed. Fifty-five faculty members volunteered; mentees were randomly allocated so that each mentor had between two to three mentees. At the end of 11 months, in July 2010, qualitative feedback was collected from mentees and mentors (Tables I and II respectively).

				<h4>Discussion
				Mentoring: barriers</h4>
				<p>
					It was a novel experience for us to initiate a mentoring programme. Feedback at the end of one year revealed that no contact was made in about one-third of instances; thus, no mentoring resulted. Informal communication revealed that mentors presumed that the onus was on the mentee ("mentee would call if in need"). Mentees, on the other hand, were hesitant about talking to faculty members, some of whom were senior professors. Studies have shown that the initiative to establish the mentoring process should be taken by the faculty member, but the responsibility to keep it going rests with the mentees <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Being unable to find common free time to meet was reported and has been described by others" id="19">(19)</a>, who must be proactive so that they get the most out of the relationship <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frei E, Stamm M, Buddeberg-Fischer B.

When specifically questioned, these mentors said they made themselves available and approachable. According to student reports, such mentors are appreciated.

				<h4>Mentoring: benefits</h4>
				<p>
					Despite the problems they reported, most mentors and mentees continued to believe that mentoring was a good idea with benefits not limited only to the academic, but also to personal and emotional aspects. Perhaps without realising it at the time, participants in the mentoring relationship demonstrated many of the characteristics of a humane doctor, viz. one who listens, shares time, is helpful, shows empathy, counsels and communicates <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fones CS, Kua EH, Goh LG.

She Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Vol X No 2 April-June 2013 was very helpful"(altruism);"It was nice to know someone in college; even though we never met, I felt secure knowing there was someone there"(emotional support, caring);"My mentor told me it was alright to be anxious; he told me to see him for five minutes every day, and that I would feel better soon. I did."(counseling). The affective domain in student learning is often neglected in favour of the cognitive, since it is difficult to design interventions that target and assess it <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Miller C. Improving and enhancing performance in the affective domain of nursing students: insights from the literature for clinical educators. Contemp Nurse. 2010 Apr-May;35(1):2-17." id="25">(25)</a>. Based on our results, it might be possible to exploit mentoring as a way of achieving learning objectives in the affective domain. Students who have experienced empathy and caring first hand from their mentors may develop into caring human beings and empathetic doctors; in this regard, mentors have an important responsibility as role models.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even mentors reported benefits, development of communication and affective skills being prime achievements. Some became aware of student problems and were able to empathise better."Suddenly I realised that the student is not simply a case-record form, or a viva-voce, but a living creature with fears and aspirations" (discovery); "It was lovely to re-discover how multifaceted, how talented students really are";"Interacting with my mentee showed me the students' perspective; I don't humiliate students anymore"(compassion). Becoming conversant with student issues is a good way to mentor students <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rose GL, Rukstalis MR, Schuckit MA. Informal mentoring between faculty and medical students. Acad Med. 2005 Apr;80(4):344-8." id="16">(16)</a>. We are encouraged by these responses; mentoring, for the benefits that it has shown in this fledgling effort, may strengthen the humanitarian instinct and enhance the development of the affective domain in both faculty and students. With mounting global interest in including medical humanities in the medical curriculum, mentoring may be a small step in that direction <a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Papadimos TJ.

				</p>
				<p>
					It was unfortunate that many individuals did not enter into a mentoring relationship. In our experience, in several instances, mentoring broke down the traditional barriers between teachers and students:"My mentor was friendly; she made it easy for me to talk to her";"It felt good to be able to discuss my problems with a teacher."Over the years, we hope mentoring becomes entrenched in the culture of the institution. New entrants to the medical course are creative and enthusiastic; however, as they advance academically, rote learning and other inherent difficulties result in intellectual stifling and burnout <a class="reference" href="#twentyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kirklin D, Meakin R.

					There is evidence, in the literature and from our results, to suggest that mentoring of medical students is a vitally important component of the medical curriculum; institutions should actively encourage it <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Coates W, Crooks K, Slavin S, Guiton G, Wilkerson L. Medical school curricular reform: fourth-year colleges improve access to career mentoring and overall satisfaction. Acad Med. 2008 Aug;83(8):754-60." id="19">(19)</a>. Based on the feedback we have received, we will assuredly continue with the programme. The barriers identified will be tackled; suggestions from both mentees and mentors will help.
				</p>
				<p>
					To summarise, this paper describes our early experience with a formal mentoring programme for students. We advocate that mentoring should be an essential part of medical training. The effort needed is small, as it is not difficult for committed faculty and student mentors to find time for their mentees. Importantly, there are benefits for both mentors and mentees; also bonding and trust between teachers and students grow. Students with effective mentors as role models will imbibe their attributes and, in turn, be good mentors, and thus perpetuate the cycle. Depending on needs and cultural sensitivities, each institution should be encouraged to evolve its own mentoring programme. What should matter is the outcome, not the process. Future work could focus on fostering and maintaining humanitarian attitudes in medical students and faculty using mentoring and the medical humanities.
