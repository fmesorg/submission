					<em>"What do you mean people don't care about  torture? We will make them care?"</em>

					Dr John Dawson, as quoted in the preface  to<em>Medicine Betrayed</em>, 1992. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="British Medical Association (Report of a Working Party), Medicine betrayed: the participations of doctors in human rights abuses.

					Do medical professionals in India care? A decade  after the publication of Medicine Betrayed by the British Medical Association,  and barely 40 days after the Medico Friend Circle <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bandewar S, Madhiwalla N et al, Carnage in Gujarat: a public health crisis. Pune: Medico Friend Circle, 2002." id="2">(2)</a> indicted a section of  doctors in Gujarat of gross neglect and violation of ethics and human rights,  the media reported that seven people accused in the Godhra train massacre were  subjected to interrogation after being administered so-called 'truth serum' -  sodium pentothal - at the government's Sir Sayaji General Hospital. This was  done with the participation of police officials, and of doctors from the  hospital's anaesthesia, surgery and psychiatry disciplines. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhan Rohit, 'A shot at justice? Truth drug for Godhra accused'. Indian Express, June 23, 2002." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malekar Anosh, 'Loosening the tongue: controversy over use of "truth serum" on Godhra accused.' The Week, July 7, 2002." id="4">4)</a>,
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, the hospital's superintendent, Dr  Kamal Pathak, refused to answer questions faxed to him by the media by saying,  "I can't reveal anything as this is something that pertains to national  interest." <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhan Rohit, 'A shot at justice? Truth drug for Godhra accused'. Indian Express, June 23, 2002." id="3">(3)</a> His reasoning is not clear. Was it to avoid discussing what  the Godhra accused revealed in the interrogation? Or was it to avoid discussing  his decision to allow police to use hospital facilities - with the direct  participation of its doctors - in an interrogation, in violation of human rights  and ethical standards?
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no indication that the doctors were  coerced by the police. On the contrary, it appears that they are proud of doing  their duty in the national interest. This is not new. Numerous instances have  been documented, in India, of doctors' direct or indirect participation in human  rights violations. We have reviewed such evidence in the past <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="(a) Jesani Amar, 'Violence and ethical responsibility of the medical profession,' Medical Ethics 1995; 3: 3-5. (b) Jesani Amar, 'Violence and health care profession in India: towards a campaign for medical neutrality,' Radical Journal of Health, 1998; 3: 143-156." id="1">(5a,b)</a>. Such  documentation, and the sustained advocacy by doctors committed to ethics and by  human rights activists, resulted in a small but important addition to the  official code of medical ethics: <em>"The physician shall not aid or abet  torture nor shall he be a party to either infliction of mental or physical  trauma or concealment of torture inflicted by some other person or agency in  clear violation of human rights."</em> <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India, 'Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002,' Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10; 66-71." id="6">(6)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This code had already been in force for more than  two months when doctors administered sodium pentothal for an interrogation. But  despite extensive media coverage of the doctors' participation in  pharmacological torture, the medical council has not even sought an explanation,  let alone held an inquiry to demonstrate some resolve in implementing its own  laws and ethical guidelines.
				</p>

				<h4>Arguments in defence</h4>
				<p>
					Three arguments were heard in the defence of these  doctors. First, the use of sodium pentothal was not torture because it did not  cause pain. Second, it was done in the national interest. And third, there is no  harm in using torture if it can save lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first argument wrongly limits the definition of  torture to pain. Torture includes the use of methods intended to obliterate the  personality of the victim or diminish physical or mental capacities, even if  they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture." id="7">(7)</a> Sodium Pentothal tops the  list of methods using 'limited force' advocated by organisations such as the US  Central Intelligence Agency whose dirty human rights record needs no  introduction. <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Johnson Kevin, Willing Richard, 'Ex-CIA chief revitalizes truth serum debate.' USA Today, April 26, 2002." id="8">(8)</a> Interestingly, even the CIA acknowledges that it is advocating  torture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Utilitarian arguments about national interest and  saving lives are well known. This assertion is not backed by evidence that such  interest was served, that what doctors did really saved lives. However, even if  there is evidence of national interest, could it be used to justify acting  unethically? The elevation of national interest above human morality has always  had disastrous consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the medical profession in India, the writing is  on the wall. Gujarat is also emerging as another kind of laboratory - a medical  laboratory violating ethics with impunity. The BMA followed up Dr John Dawson's  assertion by producing a handbook on human rights for doctors <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="British Medical Association. The medical profession and human rights: handbook for a changing agenda. London/New York: Zed Press/BMA, 2001." id="9">(9)</a>, demonstrating  its commitment to help doctors educate themselves and be ethical. The question  is: does the profession in India care?
