				<h4>Media portrayal of health professionals biased? </h4>
				<p>
					Over the last few years, the media have been repeatedly  													focusing on corruption in healthcare. Sometimes, speakers  													on television channels fling allegations at the entire medical  													community. This biased picture of pervasive corruption is  													resented by a majority of doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors have been charged with prescribing unnecessary and  													costly medicines instead of generic medicines. While there  													is a lot of difference between manufacturing cost and actual  													price of medicines, how can doctors be held responsible for  													deciding the price of a drug? It is the government that has to  													regulate the prices of essential medicines in association with  													pharmaceutical companies, not doctors.
				</p>

					In an alleged case of malpractice discussed in an episode  													of a popular television show, Mr R has accused doctors of a  													corporate hospital of mismanaging a case of cadaver transplant  													of the liver and pancreas of his wife <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sreedhara R. A letter from Dr R Sreedhara to Aamir Khan [Internet]. Aalatimes.com; 2012 Jun 07[cited 2013 Mar 31]. Available from: http://www.aalatimes.com/2012/06/07/a-letter-from-dr-r-sreedhara-to- aamir-khan/" id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK.

A nephrologist at that  													hospital contradicted this saying that Mr. R had withheld crucial  													information which may have made viewers believe his version.  													He mentions that Mr R had withheld the fact that the state  													Medical Council had thoroughly investigated the case and  													found no evidence of negligence by doctors. The nephrologist  													has also mentioned that: "The patient and her family were  													all informed about the risks and benefits of transplantation,  													more than a year prior to the surgery and informed consent  													was taken. The patient had developed a massive bleeding  													condition called Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation  													(DIC). She received platelets and other blood products to  													correct the DIC. The surgeon was fully qualified to conduct  													pancreatic transplantation as well as kidney transplantation  													and had conducted numerous multi-organ transplantation  													surgeries. The hospital was also registered for multi-organ  													transplantation." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK. Doctor, heal thyself [Internet]. Aalatimes.com. 2012 Jun 01[cited 2013 Mar 31]. Available from: http://www.aalatimes.com/2012/06/01/ doctor-heal-thyself/" id="2">(2)</a>. Television channels and other mass  													media should confirm the authenticity of information before  													telecasting it to the world.

					The numbers of doctors' licences cancelled in some developed  													countries and in India have been compared time and again  													by the media; but no comparison is made of the number  													of physical attacks on doctors while on duty in India and  													elsewhere, or of the number of people convicted of such  													offences; or of stipends, working conditions, duty hours,  													or accommodation provided to medical students and  													doctors. Even basic infrastructure and facilities like clean  													drinking water, subsidised canteens, separate toilets for  													women, are not provided in Indian government hospitals <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi SK. Doctor, heal thyself [Internet]. Aalatimes.com. 2012 Jun 01[cited 2013 Mar 31]. Available from: http://www.aalatimes.com/2012/06/01/ doctor-heal-thyself/" id="2">(2)</a>.

					The media preaches that brilliant students who take up  													medicine should consider it only as service to mankind;  													they should go to other fields if they want to live a good life.  													Why impose the burden of charity and social service only on  													medical professionals? It takes almost thirteen years for a  													doctor to reach specialist status, with a compulsory year of  													government service after graduation. In fact, doctors are the  													worst paid professionals for the hard work and dedication  													they put in. Why are only doctors being forced to work in rural  													and government hospitals after completing their education?  													The rural sector surely needs the help of other qualified  													professionals as well. Why aren't they compelled to do public  													service after graduation, or prevented from going abroad for  													better facilities as doctors are? In spite of all the hardships,  													even today, the medical profession has a fairly large number of  													selfless and sensitive professionals <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Public Health Foundation of India, National Health Systems Resource Centre, State Health Systems Resource Centre.

					The media should present a balanced picture of the profession and exert pressure on the authorities to act against corrupt health professionals. If the media continue to mention only the darker side of profession, it will hurt the country's healthcare system &ndash; the public will lose faith in doctors and a large number of students who aspire to be doctors will be dissuaded from
					doing so.
