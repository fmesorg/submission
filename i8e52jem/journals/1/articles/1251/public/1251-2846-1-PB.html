					The field of medical ethics in India has until recently
					revolved largely around issues in medical practice or
					research involving clinical interventions /
					contraceptive trials, etc. However, as more and more of us
					venture into health systems research that links with other
					social issues and probes sensitive and often private aspects
					of behaviour, we are using non-traditional research designs
					and qualitative methodologies &ndash; all of which bring us face
					to face with complex ethical dilemmas.
				</p>
				<p>
					We illustrate this with the recent example of a study on
					induced abortion that we did at the KEM Hospital Research
					Centre, Pune, in 1995, in a rural community where the centre
					has been involved in both health care delivery and operations
					research for many years. Though abortion in India had been
					legal for over 25 years there were few data on abortion
					beyond its demographic, fertility or mortality aspects.
					Again, most available information was based on urban
					hospital populations or on secondary analysis of case
					records. Our own interest in the issue stemmed from our
					previous work in the same community that had shown a
					surprisingly low abortion-related mortality but also
					suggested that access to services was not uniformly
					available to all women, and that we knew little about where
					and how women in the rural context were accessing abortion
					services and how their choices and experiences were
					modified by their socio-cultural context. Only a communitybased
					study could have answered many of these critical
					questions. Yet, designing such a study posed many
					methodological challenges. Under-reporting of abortion
					events in the survey situation is common. The abortion event
					may be forgotten; 'denial' may be a psychological coping
					mechanism to deal with an unpleasant event. Some women
					prefer to label their induced abortion event as spontaneous.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study design was based on a method of case
					identification that relied on identifying women who had
					undergone an induced abortion during a defined reference
					period of 18 months using secondary sources of information:
					health service providers (both those providing abortions
					and those treating complications) in and around the
					community, health and development workers, women's
					groups and other community members. Cases identified
					through providers were enrolled prospectively; providers
					of services were asked to be the initial link with the women.
					The providers were expected to explain the study to the
					client and did not provide us information where they did not
					feel it in their or their client's interests for the subsequent
					interview to take place. Wherever possible we tried to arrange
					for the interview to take place in a clinic setting. Given the
					fact that follow-up visits post abortion are not the norm, not many interviews could be achieved in the clinic setting.
				</p>
				<p>
					The community-based informants were also asked to serve
					as the link between the case and the researchers but not all
					were willing or able to do so. Thus we were faced with the
					dilemma of doing community-based interviews with two
					types of women &ndash; those who had agreed or knew of the
					impending interview, and those whom we had identified but
					for whom we had no knowledge of their potential willingness
					to participate. While approaching women who had
					previously agreed should have been a simple matter, it still
					did not deal with the fact that consent is dynamic and
					contextual and the woman could well have changed her mind
					in the intervening period, and neither the woman nor we
					would have control over the presence of others at the time
					of interview done at home. Though using secondary sources
					as sampling methods is fairly commonplace in
					anthropological studies, we felt that using this information
					to subsequently interview the women when the identification
					process had not assessed her willingness to share the
					information posed difficult-to-resolve dilemmas. Would
					approaching such women for an interview be a breach of
					confidentiality? Whose confidentiality? How could coercive
					participation be avoided?
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming to terms with that dilemma in part at least, we felt,
					depended on how sensitive or private the issue was
					considered in the cultural context of the community. Over
					the course of a series of key informant interviews with
					women, health workers and providers that we conducted
					over the next three months, we gauged the sensitivity of the
					issue in that community and tried to determine areas of
					special concern in using such a method. Based on these
					inputs we realised that while for most married women who
					had undergone an abortion with the knowledge and support
					of her husband the issue was neither overly sensitive nor
					stigmatising, women who had out-of-wedlock pregnancies
					and some married women who did not have family support
					for their action could be at social risk if their induced
					abortions became public knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where informants felt the woman was at high risk of being
					stigmatised by the interview process (e.g. unmarried women)
					we did not interview them at all unless it was possible in a
					setting like the clinic. All others were approached at home
					for an interview. We clustered women into geographic areas,
					and drew up a sample of women from the eligible couple list
					of the area among which were included the women who had
					been identified to us. Thus when the interviewers went out
					to the village they were looking for and interviewing both
					cases and non-cases (dummies) using the same
					questionnaire. When individual women were approached
					for the interview, the interviewer did not confront a case
					with the knowledge that she knew that the woman had an
					induced abortion. She instead asked her for permission to
					interview her on her health problems and past pregnancies
					and their outcomes. During the course of this pregnancy
					history, if the women mentioned the reference induced abortion we asked permission to continue interviewing her
					about the abortion experience and explained the full purpose
					of collecting the information. Women were free to
					discontinue the interview at this point, and in fact some did
					so. If the woman did not reveal her induced abortion or
					called it spontaneous, further questions regarding that
					aspect were not asked.
				</p>
				<p>
					We tried to ensure that the person doing the interview was
					blinded to the fact that the respondent was a case or a dummy
					but this was not possible in every instance. However, the
					possibility of interviewers coercing the woman into admitting
					an abortion was minimised by stressing the research
					objective of studying the differences between the
					characteristics of women who acknowledged their induced
					abortion from those that did not. In fact by the end of the
					study, several women who were interviewed as dummies
					reported an induced abortion in the reference period and
					thus became cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					While guaranteeing one-to-one privacy in the rural setting
					is difficult, attempts were made to create artificial privacy by
					using a 'team' of interviewers, where one person conducted
					the actual interview while the other interviewers (including
					a male) engaged other family members in one-on-one dummy
					interviews or conversations. While it was always easy for
					the family to identify the real interviewee, these dummies
					still served the purpose of allowing us a modicum of private
					time with the woman. The interviewers were also trained in
					being able to divert the interview subject when unwanted
					family members or outsiders insisted on listening in.
				</p>
				<p>
					This strategy allowed us on the one hand to ascertain
					women's willingness to talk about her abortion without
					confronting her with information she may not have wanted
					to be confronted with. It allowed her a dignified way of
					refusing the interview and the framing of the interview within
					a broader focus and interviewing other women allowed her
					and us to present a non-threatening explanation of the study
					to family or others should her situation warrant it. Yet, this
					was achieved at the expense of being disguising the full and
					real purpose of the study. Again, while interviewing noncases
					and other family members provided privacy and
					minimised attention being focused on the women, data from
					the dummies who were interviewed were not used
					scientifically. While these women suffered little harm other
					than loosing the time spent on the interview and may indeed
					have benefited from the medical referral and linkages that
					were made available to them when they required it, their
					participation still presents some unresolved questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consent at all the various stages that it was taken remained
					oral rather than written. Again, this was a deliberate decision
					since we felt that introducing a formal document would not
					necessarily give authenticity to the process but could in
					fact bring in a feeling of mistrust and suspicion. Ultimately,
					the quality of the consent procedure &ndash; written or oral &mdash; is
					as good as the researcher's integrity. A signed document is
					no guarantee that the woman's rights have been
					safeguarded. On the other hand how does one ascertain
					that women have indeed participated willingly and freely?
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, while we did not provide monetary incentives to
					anyone, we provided medical referral linkages to all participants. We were fortunate to be backed up by a medical
					hospital so this was possible. Could the expectation of
					benefit as we were service providers have influenced
					participation? What are the implications?
				</p>
				<p>
					The dilemmas we faced had no easy answers. A
					scientifically poor study is unethical by its very nature. At
					the same time, addressing scientific rigour often brought us
					in direct conflict with the ability to safeguard the
					participants' dignity, autonomy or confidentiality. The
					tension between these conflicts is increasingly being faced
					by those researching reproductive health issues and using
					qualitative methods which, though sensitive, also can be
					intrusive and potentially threatening. The recent code of
					conduct in social science research <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="National Committee for Ethics in Social Science Research in Health: Ethical guidelines for social science research in health. Centre for Enquiry in Health and Allied Themes, Mumbai, 2000." id="1">(1)</a> is an exciting
					development. If this code is to have any meaning, we
					researchers need to be upfront, not defensive or evasive of
					the dilemmas that we confront. Good intentions and good
					faith are prerequisites but never enough in determining
					questions of ethics. The dilemmas do not detract from the
					science but only enrich it.
