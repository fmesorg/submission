					Are  drug donations by pharmaceutical companies evidence of their social commitment  or are they just another marketing technique?
				</p>
				<p>
					In  mid-2002, the German multinational Boehringer Ingelheim got much publicity  following its announcement that it would donate the drug nevirapine to  developing countries for programmes preventing maternal&ndash;foetal transmission of  HIV. Company spokespeople stated that this donation was a response to the AIDS  crisis in South Africa.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  this donation was actually a clever response to growing global criticism of  companies producing drugs for AIDS. These drugs are sold at exorbitant prices  which deny life-saving treatment to the majority of those who need it. Further,  multinational companies and the governments of developed countries have been  accused of undermining the efforts made by developing countries to provide  access to drugs through compulsory licensing and parallel imports.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indeed,  there are many strings attached to this offer:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Though the drug can be used to treat       adults, the company's offer is limited to one-dose therapy at the time of       delivery. So children who do not get infected will be orphans very soon as       a result of this 'free drug' because their mothers will get no treatment.
					</li>
					<li>
						This offer is not available to       countries implementing compulsory licensing and parallel       imports&mdash;internationally accepted legal procedures by which countries may       either manufacture life-saving drugs or import them at the best possible       price, irrespective of their patent status. In this way, the company tries       to restrict the rights of developing countries.
					</li>
					<li>
						The donation ends in 2006&mdash;the deadline       the World Trade Organization has set in the TRIPS&nbsp;agreement for least       developed countries to implement patents for drugs. It is hard to believe       that this is a coincidence.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Further,  the safety of nevirapine is not well-established. Though potentially useful, it  can also have severe unwanted&mdash;sometimes lethal&mdash;effects. Nevirapine is not yet  licensed in Europe and the USA for preventing mother-to-child-transmission of  HIV. So the donation could also be interpreted as a large but not  well-controlled trial of the drug.
				</p>
				<p>
					Boehringer  Ingelheim colluded with the German government by announcing a 'public&ndash;private partnership'  for the mother-to-child HIV&ndash;transmission programme. According to the  government's calculations, the limited use of nevirapine in three African  project areas will cost approximately six million German marks per year. The  company contributes a fraction of the cost of the entire project, and receives  a good deal of publicity for this. Buko Pharma&ndash;Kampagne, Germany (<a href="http://www.bukopharma.de/" target="_blank">www.bukopharma.de</a>),  initiated a letter campaign against Boehringer Ingelheim and the German government  telling them to stop this unhealthy donation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  difficult to convince the public&mdash;and even the medical profession&ndash;of the damage  done by such donations. Most would say, 'Let people have something; they are  dying without medicines now.' Often people are blinded to the politics behind  drug donations&mdash;the Boehringer donation is one such example.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  general, drug donations are likely to create expensive interventions that are  not integrated into healthcare systems and take money away from a comprehensive  healthcare approach. Drug donations help corporates build their image, control  the market, or get tax exemption from the government. They don't help people.
