				<h4>Expert opinion in legal cases</h4>
				<p>
					The dilemma faced by Dr. Yash Lokhandwala ' can be equated to that articulated by Hamlet - <em>'To be or not to be, that is the question</em>.'
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer to the question posed in the last line of his editorial is: <em>'Do what your conscience dictates.'</em>. If the doctor wants to 'just make excuses', as most are doing, that doctor is merely part of the herd and lacks conscientiousness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctor should study the merits of the case and then extend whole hearted support at all levels and in all courts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) with its batalfton of so-called executive committee members formed by the so-called experts can easily shield the doctors. They misuse their status and easily manipulate the outcome in favour of the doctor, howsoever negligent he may be. The complainant should think a hundred times before ever going to the medical council.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is worse, the manipulated decisions and judgements passed by MMC are quoted in Consumer and Criminal Courts to create a bias in the minds of judges. Judges equate MMC with the Bar Council! This is, of course, far from the truth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors take full advantage of the above facts. Various medical associations have formed medico-legal cells for the protection of senior consultants and others attached to hospitals and nursing homes. The public is left high and dry, bereft of support from any one.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need of the hour is a panel of sincere, honest, knowledgeable doctors with unchallengeable integrity who will provide patients and their relatives unbiased medical opinions in writing. Why do you not form such a panel?
