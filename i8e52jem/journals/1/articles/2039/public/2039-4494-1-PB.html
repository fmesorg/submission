				<h4>Ethical use of animals in scientific research</h4>
				<p>
					A number of articles  have appeared in the press recently regarding a visit to the National Institute  of Immunology (NII), New Delhi, by an inspection team of the Committee for the  Prevention of Cruelty in Scientific Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The  articles were extremely critical of the condition of the monkeys kept in the  NII and its use of animals in scientific research. One article stated that the  CPCSEA had recommended closure of the primate house at the NII, in effect  terminating all research at the Institute involving these animals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Delhi Science Forum (DSF),  a non-profit public interest organisation of scientists, technologists and  social scientists working in areas of science and technology policy, is  extremely concerned at these developments at NII which are but the latest of a  series of similar actions by CPCSEA in different institutions. These actions  reveal disturbing trends in the structure and functioning of CPCSEA and also  have serious implications for the future of scientific research in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					DSF designated a  three-member team to visit NII and examine the issue covering not only the  conditions and use of animals at NII but also the functioning of the CPCSEA.  DSF spoke with CPCSEA team members and sought their views but was unable to  obtain a copy of the team's report from either the team or CPCSEA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Contrary to the  allegation that animals are kept in overcrowded enclosures, DSF found that the  207 primates at NII are kept in 13 large outdoor enclosures (5 more are under  construction) and additional indoor enclosures for observations and rotation, with  small chambers in some outdoor enclosures with provision for heating or cooling  depending on season. Enclosures are cleaned four times a day, about an hour  after each feeding period. NII also has operating theatres and three full-time  veterinarians. Therefore, the animal facilities at NII provide ample space, are  in good condition, and are well-maintained.
				</p>
				<p>
					Against the allegation  that over 90% of the monkeys are infected with TB, NII records and DSF's  observations show that only 2 adult monkeys out of 207 have TB, and these,  along with one female's infant, are in quarantine, under observation and  treatment. NII records show that all incoming monkeys are quarantined and  tested for TB, such testing also being conducted regularly for all the monkeys,  with infected monkeys being treated and painlessly put to sleep as per approved  procedure if not cured.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the more  sensational allegations was that the monkeys at NII were undernourished. DSF  examined the monkeys' dietary and nutritional status besides feeding practices  at NII. Monkeys at NII are fed four times a day, with special pelletised feeds,  channa, bread with vitamin and other nutritional supplements (both additional  for pregnant and lactating animals), fruits and vegetables. Monkeys at NII thus  obtain more than the internationally recommended standard of 70-100 kCal/kg of  bodyweight per day.
				</p>
				<p>
					NII has Standard  Operating Procedures for care of animals and their use in experiments which are  monitored and overseen by NII's Ethics Committee. DSF found not only that  conditions and treatment of animals at NII were satisfactory but also that  records were basically sound, properly maintained and procedures broadly  conforming to international standards were being followed. Of course, there is  always room for improvement and NII scientists and managers appeared open and  willing to discuss any measures that may be recommended in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not all the CPCSEA team  members agree with the opinions as reflected in sections of the press and  reiterated by some members to DSF. This makes the non-availability of the team  report all the more serious and, if action is being taken or contemplated based  on such unsubstantiated individual opinions, this raises grave concerns about  pre-determined, motivated and biased functioning of CPCSEA.
				</p>
				<p>
					DSF explicitly  recognises the necessity for regulation of use of animals in scientific  research to ensure ethical and proper treatment of animals and pursuit of  research in accordance with clearly prescribed rules. The fact that the CPCSEA  is a statutory body, with rules governed by law, is a positive aspect not only  ensuring compliance but also benefiting scientific research and practice. The  rules under the relevant Act are also broadly as endorsed by the scientific  community in India and abroad.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the CPCSEA as  constituted gives representation to scientific departments and the research  community, apart from animal rights activists, in practice and in the manner it  functions, the latter have virtually taken over the CPCSEA and its various  bodies, and have subverted the statutory body. CPCSEA today appears to act not  to regulate the use of animals in scientific research but to completely stop it  now and prevent it in future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some fundamental defects  in the constitution of the CPCSEA under the relevant Act urgently require to be  addressed. The NII episode, as well as previous ones at JNU, Indian Institute  of Science, AIIMS, National Institute of Nutrition and other research  institutions in both the public and private sectors, brings out sharply that  the CPCSEA now appears to be functioning as police, prosecutor, judge and  hangman, resulting in arbitrariness and lack of transparency and  accountability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CPCSEA should be  overhauled, and its advisory, inspection and other bodies completely  reconstituted, with due representation of the scientific community apart from  those with concerns for animal welfare. Inspection reports should be shared  with the concerned institution for greater transparency, to enable peer review  and full participation of research institutions in the regulatory process
				</p>
				<p>
					CPCSEA should be brought  under the ministry of science and technology with proper structures and  mechanisms for transparency and accountability
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of NII, no  action should be taken on the basis of this inspection team's report since the  entire process has been deeply flawed and vitiated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, DSF calls upon  the scientific community to vigorously debate these issues, evolve a consensus  and work towards a thorough overhaul and reform of this important regulatory  body.
