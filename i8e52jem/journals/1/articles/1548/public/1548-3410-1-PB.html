				<p>
					In an unfolding tragedy of unprecedented dimensions, the ongoing doctors'  strike in the city has resulted in the death of six patients in three days.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients at the King George Hospital (KGH), with the fond hope  of earning a fresh lease on life, breathed their last unattended. Though the  doctors empathise with the plight of the 'poor' patients and admit that  providing emergency care is of paramount importance, the promised help has been  too late in coming to save precious lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unable to move to private hospitals as they could not afford to  pay the hefty fees, the patients stayed put in KGH. Five of the patients died  at KGH where the promised emergency help came too late...

					Two senior doctors of the Lok Nayak Hospital (in Delhi) are under investigation  for allegedly fudging hospital records to give a senior Delhi IAS officer, D.  C. Sankhla, who has been named as the prime accused in a murder case in  Samalkha in Panipat district, a fake alibi. Sankhla, the main accused in the  case of murder of Jain, a farmer in Samalkha, claims that he was not in  Samalkha on the night in question but had, in fact, been treated at the Lok  Nayak Hospital in Delhi then.
				</p>
				<p>
					Police officials from Samalkha, who visited the Lok Nayak  Hospital last week, have recorded the statement of the two doctors who  allegedly faked the entry of Sankhla's name in the casualty register to show  that he had sought treatment there when, in fact, he had not. Superintendent of  Police Sharma said that investigations at the Lok Nayak Hospital indicated that  one senior doctor at the hospital who is said to be a close friend of Sankhla,  telephoned one of the doctors on duty at the casualty ward that night and asked  him to enter the name of D. C. Sankhla in the register maintained there. The  treatment card of Sankhla was later backdated on the basis of this entry made  in connivance with the hospital staff.

				<p>
					The Tamil Nadu  Government has instituted disciplinary action against the Government General  Hospital's cardiologist Dr. C. V. Bhirmanandam, for false diagnosis of FERA  detainee T. T. V. Dinakaran, nephew of Sasikala and friend of former chief  minister J. Jayalalitha. In February, a few days after his arrest, Dinakaran  had complained of chest pain and was admitted to the General Hospital. It was  diagnosed as high blood pressure and cardiac disorder which required immediate  and intense treatment . Certified thus, Dinakaran stayed at the hospital from  20 February to 5 May. Later, a follow-up diagnosis was done at the Southern  Railway Hospital, which pronounced him to be of normal health.

				<p>
					A year after the <em>Indian Express</em> exposed the  doctor-criminal nexus in the government run J.J. Group of Hospitals, the  quasi-judicial Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) has found, <em>prima facie</em>, evidence to  initiate a probe against Lekha Pathak, Honorary Professor and Head of the  hospital's cardiology department. MMC's executive committee resolved to issue a  show-cause notice to Pathak on two counts. Firstly, whether the professional  knowledge and expertise of the medical practitioner was used to keep the  prisoners comfortable in the Intensive Care Unit and secondly, whether  professional knowledge, clinical, skills were used to misguide the judiciary  with a view to support the criminals.
				</p>
				<p>
					When contacted, Pathak said she had not received any notice so  far. In fact, she said, the government committee which probed into the  allegations had cleared her.
				</p>
				<p>
					Official records show that the actual enquiry was conducted by  Urmila Sathe, Professor and Head of the Department of Anaesthesia, J. J. Group  of Hospitals without examining the case papers mentioned in the (<em>Express</em>)  report.

The Times of India 17 October 1996 p3" id="5">(5)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Concerned about its negative impact on health infrastructure in rural  Maharashtra, the state government is considering asking the Supreme Court to  review a recent order preventing those who have studied one form of medicine  from practising another.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to provide adequate medical care to the rural  population, the state government had issued a resolution a few years ago allowing  ayurvedic doctors to practice allopathy.

				<h4>Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) in a Rs. 32,00,000 scam <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ghosal Sumit: MMC in a Rs. 32 lakh miniscam. The Indian Express 19 December 1996 p3" id="6">(6)</a></h4>
				<p>
					MMC has raked in over Rs. 32 lakh since 1992 by way of excess charges from  fresh medical graduates seeking to be registered as doctors. Until May 1992,  MMC charged Rs. 110 as first time registration fees from all young doctors who  are required, under the Maharashtra Medical Council Act 1965 to enrol  themselves with the MMC before they can practice medicine in any form.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fee was suddenly hiked to Rs. 520 without obtaining the  mandatory prior permission of the State Government.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since approximately 2000 graduates apply for registration each  year, over 8000 have paid Rs. 520 since May 1992 - bringing in about Rs. 32  lakh!
				</p>
				<p>
					MMC registrar A. K. Karekar told this reporter that a proposal  for increasing the fees had been sent to the State Health Ministry and  government regulation (GR) would be issues 'soon'. Highly placed officials in  Mantralaya said on 17 December 1996 that no GR had ever been issues for raising  MMC charges and that the increased charges were a clear violation of legal  norms.
				</p>
				<p>
					They also said that MMC was supposed to submit audited accounts  each year to the medical education department of the state government. MMC has  failed to do this even once in the past four years.
				</p>
				<p>
					The attention of top officials of the medical education  department was drawn to these malpractices by MMC on at least two occasions in  the past but they did nothing even to investigate matters, leave alone take  steps to correct wrongs.
