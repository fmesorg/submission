					In 1991,  I was a consultant general surgeon practising in Ratnagiri. The events that  followed turned our lives upside down. Patience, faith, determination,  devotion&mdash;every possible human quality in my family&mdash;was tested. I am glad to say  that they met this challenge.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  began on 17 October 1994 in Ratnagiri. I had high-grade fever, which I thought  was flu. The fever disappeared with a single dose of ciprofloxacin and I  resumed work the next day. However, in the following weeks, I started feeling  extremely weak and began to lose weight. A few months later, I started getting  fever in the evenings but I ignored this and took symptomatic treatment. By  June 1995, I started getting a dry, hacking cough and painful deglutition. But  no alarm bells rang and I continued to work. Then I came down with an acute  sore throat and fever. A tablet of crocin produced severe sweating that  drenched my clothes and bed sheets. Finally, I realised that something was  seriously wrong with my health, and consulted a local physician. By then, I had  become severely dehydrated and had to be admitted to a nursing home. I had  high-grade fever, I was not responding to antipyretics, and I could not sleep.  It was at this stage that the consultant physician advised a test for HIV  infection. Shockingly, the result was positive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Forget  counselling, the physician had no time to talk to me. The diagnosis devastated  my life. In one moment, whatever I had achieved in the past 30 years fell  apart. I was transferred to Pune where another physician confirmed the diagnosis.  Even today I am unnerved by the memories. When I asked about my prognosis, the  consultant just shrugged his shoulders and walked off.
				</p>
				<p>
					After  some days, I was discharged against medical advice and came home to Ratnagiri.  I was treated for pulmonary tuberculosis and candidiasis, and also started on  zidovudine. However, I suffered from severe diarrhoea that did not respond to  any medication. I could not tolerate zidovudine and it had to be stopped  eventually.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had  lost my will to survive. But my wife and family members encouraged me to fight  the disease. Their daily encouragement boosted my confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  medical community was shocked to hear the news but knew my family for years and  that helped me a lot. People were considerate and helpful. Some offered me a  job. Others offered a place for my wife to start her general practice. They did  not even charge any rent for the first three years.
				</p>
				<p>
					I  recovered gradually, and began working as a lecturer in medical laboratory  technology. I could no longer practise medicine since Ratnagiri is a small  place and everybody knew my HIV status. I accepted my fate.
				</p>
				<p>
					I did  not even try to trace the possible route of infection, forget blaming someone  else for my misery. I simply accepted it as my destiny. My wife, parents and  in-laws were also supportive and that helped me calm down.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  disease resurfaced a year later, on 30 April 1996 to be exact. The first  indication was pain in the epigastric region, which radiated to the thoracic  vertebrae. Then I started getting severe herpetic ulcers in my mouth. The pain  was unbearable. As my condition worsened I became unable to eat even semi-solid  food. I was losing weight rapidly. My brain had become affected. A few months  later, I was transferred to Pune once more. At this point my CD4 count was 39.  I was treated for herpesvirus infection and put back on anti-retroviral therapy  (ART).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  dementia associated with this disease made our lives horrible. My wife and  family made a huge effort to see me through. They ensured that I took medicines  and food regularly as I had lost orientation in time and space. This time my  recovery took more than six months. My abnormal behaviour continued for almost  a year. Fortunately I survived.
				</p>
				<p>
					In July  1997, my father passed away. This was another setback in my life. My life was  in shambles. I lost the will to live.
				</p>
				<p>
				In  August that year I met my spiritual guru who has transformed my life since  then. There are no words to explain what I got from him. I was at peace with  myself, my HIV status and health. I gained the confidence to fight back, live  with it and maybe one day overcome it. I changed my lifestyle after this  meeting. I started praying regularly. I do <em>yogasans and pranayama daily.</em> I have  developed my own diet, which is quite different from what is usually  prescribed. </p>
				<p>
					In  1998, I developed resistance to the ART regimen and had to be put on a new  regimen, which I have been following for the past six years. 'Touch wood', I  have not encountered any resistance or side-effects so far. I owe this to the  lifestyle and diet that I follow, and the spiritual guidance of my guru.
				</p>
				<p>
					All  these years I had not practised medicine. Initially my poor physical health  prevented me from doing so. Later it was the fear of exposure to communicable  diseases. On 4 May, 2002, I started running an outpatient department (OPD)  exclusively for HIV-positive people. It was a quantum leap for me, considering  what I had been through. For the past two years I have run the OPD without  interruption. I have also brought together HIV-positive people in my district  and formed a group of people living with HIV/AIDS, the Guruprasad Trust. Today  HIV-positive people from all over Ratnagiri are referred here. We offer them  counselling services, treatment of opportunistic infections and ART. We also  accept donations to help HIV-positive people.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has  taken a long time and massive efforts for our group to reach this stage. People  in the medical/paramedical fraternity affected by this disease face serious  professional, economic and social setbacks. I appeal to those affected to come  together. The idea is to form a group of affected healthcare providers to help  themselves as well as other HIV-positive patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have  now lived with HIV for nine years. The local medical fraternity has seen me  suffer. They have seen me with dementia and cerebral atrophy. They have seen me  fight it out every day. Today they are seeing me as a consultant in HIV  medicine. They respect my fight back and support me by referring HIV-positive  patients to me.
