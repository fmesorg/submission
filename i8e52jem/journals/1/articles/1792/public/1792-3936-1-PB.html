				<h4>Tabrik Currimbhoy, (Context, New Delhi. 1994, 214 pages. Rs. 85)</h4>
				<p>
					'The right of Tabrik Currimbhoy to be identified as the author of this book is asserted by him.' Following this unusual avowal we read that 'every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of all entrics...' Currimbhoy reassures the rest of the profession. The omission of names of any doctor. hospital, medical institution, facility, or diagnostic centre does not in any way imply criticism or lack of faith.
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>What is the aim of the author?</em> '... giving the patient a choice and an opportunity to consider where he can get the best possible medical attention for this particular problem...' </p>
				<p>
					<em>How did the author collect his data?</em> 'The method that has been used in naming the <em>Best</em> of them is both subjective and deductive given the fact that not precise, objective approach is . . . possible. The calibre of a doctor and the quality of his treatment cannot be measured... Just a <em>success-rate</em>, bringing in its wake vague considerations like <em>fame</em> and <em>popularity</em> do not necessarily reflect talent. It may well be that a brilliant Neurosurgeon has a higher failure-rate operating on his patients. simply because he is willing to take the chance in accepting hopeless cases which may have been refused by his less confident counterparts...'
				</p>
				<p>
					The . . . doctors whose names appear... have been chosen with an acute sense of responsibility after long and searching discussions with their colleagues both within their own specialties and from outside... Who would they get treated by if faced with a medical problem themselves'? . . . The other important method was to take a close look at the second opinion factor... Whose second opinion would (these doctors) seek for dificult cases...'
				</p>
				<p>
					Not surprisingly, I turned to the field about which I know a little - neurosurgery. On reading the second entry under this specialty, I wondered how Dr. P. E. Bharucha could have erred so gravely. She is certainly not in the list of pediatricians. Currintbltoy tells us that she was awarded the M. S. and M. Clt. The latter degree must have been obtained whilst she was Head of the Departntent of Pediatrics at the K. E. M. Hospital for that is when the course in neurosurgery was started. Dr. Gajendra Sinlt has been inducted into the Sikh fraternity and into the B. J. Wadia Children's Hospital where, presumably, he assists Dr. Pilloo Bharucha.

					<em>Is the book a violation of medical ethics?</em> If - as appears most likely - it has been written by a person who is not a medical practitioner. The question of medical ethics does not arise. The author must be faulted for blatant misrepresentation of facts and misleading the sick. These might cause irreparable harm. One example: Patients rushing to Jaslok and Bombay Hospital after serious injury or accident may be turned away for a variety of reasons. Currimbhoy tells us that he has consulted medical doctors. Since we know nothing more about them it is impossible to draw any conclusions. Were they indeed of eminence and rectitude, they should have checked the book for accuracy. In fairness, the author should have told readers their names, for they appear to be his chief source of information.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are established objective means for evaluating the calibre of a doctor. It is a pity Currimbhoy is ignorant of this. Had he used them, he would, perhaps have achieved part of his stated goal.
