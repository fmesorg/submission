				<h4>Lie RK, Emanuel E, Grady C, Wendler D. The standard of care debate: the Declaration of Helsinki versus the international consensus opinion. J Med Ethics 2004;30:190-3.</h4>
				<p>
					The revised Declaration of Helsinki, 2000 mandates that
					controls in a research trial receive the best care available
					anywhere and that participants get ongoing care after the
					conclusion of the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lie et al. argue in favour of an alternative international
					consensus position which considers that it is ethically
					justifiable to conduct a trial in a developing country
					without providing the best worldwide standard of care, as
					long as: (i) there is a valid scientific reason and the treatment
					being evaluated is less costly or simpler; (ii) there is a
					clear social benefit for the developing country, and (iii)
					benefits outweigh the risks for the individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					After stating that 'moral questions are not decided by
					which view gets the most votes', the authors do exactly
					that&mdash;they argue that the alternative position is better
					because it was arrived at independently by many
					international organisations such as the Council for
					International Organisations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS),
					National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and
					the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),
					etc. Furthermore, all organisations included some
					representation from the developing world. Authors posit
					that the absence of any justification accompanying the
					Helsinki rules and the lack of transparency in how the
					rules were derived has robbed the Declaration of any
					moral authority and created controversy. They conclude
					with the statement, '...ethical guidelines should prohibit
					behaviours and practices that are clearly and
					incontrovertibly unethical, while recognising that there
					may be more than one ethically acceptable approach to a
					difficult issue. The fact that many...came to the same view,
					suggests that even if the position is not the optimal ethical
					standard, it is at least not clearly unethical.'

				<h4>Schuklenk U. The standard of care debate: against the
				myth of an 'international consensus opinion'. J Med Ethics
				2004;30:194-7.</h4>
				<p>
					Professor Schuklenk debunks the myth of a consensus
					opinion. He shows that the lower standards of care proposed
					by the consensus, mix economic with scientific reasons
					and are not necessarily accepted by the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Schuklenk characterises Lie's argument as a procedural
					matter: different groups in different countries reached the
					same conclusion, which is not the same as different groups
					together agreeing on a common position; the latter comes
					closer to an international consensus. He demonstrates that
					the consensus finding processes of these organisations were
					flawed in lack of '...transparent method of selection of
					participants, discussions and the utilisation of the input
					provided by professionals, representation from the target
					group and interested public.' In his opinion, these
					organisations do not constitute a real-world representation
					and only the World Health Organization (WHO) can
					satisfactorily play the role of an international organisation
					with sufficient standing to develop and promulgate ethical
					guidelines for research.

				<h4>Commentary</h4>
				<p>
					In 1964, the World Medical Association (WMA) developed
					guidelines for ethical conduct of human research in what
					came to be known as the Helsinki Declaration <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Available from URL: http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm (accessed on June 18, 2004)." id="1">(1)</a>. The
					declaration was modified in 1975, 1983, 1989 and 2000.
					Two areas of the 2000 Declaration evoked significant
					controversy: prohibition of placebo-controls and a
					requirement that controls receive the best care available
					anywhere. The concerns involving use of placebo were
					addressed in 2002 by modifying the language to provide
					for placebo-controlled arms in selected situations.
					Reservations persist about the need to provide the best
					available care anywhere to all participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					The quality of care debate affects the patients who volunteer
					for studies, physicians who carry out research as well as the
					Government of India who must vet the protocols.
				</p>
				<p>
					Applying the basic principles of medical ethics (autonomy,
					beneficence, non-malfeasance and distributive justice) to
					this controversy, only distributive justice may be invoked
					to argue for the best care available for patients volunteering
					for an international trial. This raises several questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					What do we mean by standard of care? It is assumed to
					mean drugs, investigations, doctors and hospitals.
					However, care is more than that&mdash;clean water, adequate
					food, sanitary living space, and an infrastructure that
					allows people to travel in a timely manner to get the care
					that they need. How are we going to assure equality
					between USA and Uganda in all aspects of care? It will be
					hard to assure the same ‘care’ even within one country,
					let alone across the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next question is: Should distributive justice be invoked
					across international borders or should it apply only within
					the borders of the country where the research is to be carried
					out? Some may argue that if the organisation initiating
					research is in one country and the research is carried out in
					another country, then the principle of distributive justice
					should consider the populations of the two countries as one
					and insist that whatever is being offered to the research
					participants in the initiating country should be offered to
					the participants in the other country. Even in this scenario,
					if one limits care merely to provision of drugs, there are
					problems. Many of the drugs, such as drugs against HIV,
					require sophisticated laboratory tests that may be expensive
					and technically beyond the ability of the recipient country;
					in addition, well-staffed hospitals are needed to deal with
					the side-effects or complications of treatment. Should the
					research organisation be then required to staff and maintain
					a laboratory and hospital permanently in that country?
					Distributive justice also requires that patients in a given
					country get similar care; by setting up special centres where
					participants in a research trial get far superior care to that
					afforded to patients with the same disease elsewhere, are
					we not compromising that principle?
				</p>
				<p>
					In the US, research participants are assured that all
					expenses of the trial (travel expense, office visits,
					investigations, drugs, etc.) are borne by the research
					organisation and if the drug being tested proves
					beneficial, it is provided free to the participants as long
					as they need it. In reality this free period has proven to be
					of short duration as once the drug receives approval by
					the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), medical
					insurance and government programmes pick up the tab.
					The situation is different in most third world countries
					which do not have either medical insurance or
					government-sponsored health care for its population. In
					this case, either the research organisation commits to
					providing lifelong treatment to the participants or the
					government of the country defrays the costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The philosophy and moral underpinning of the Helsinki
					Declaration, 2000 are obvious. The intent is clearly to
					protect vulnerable populations, be it against the predatory
					practices of multinational pharmaceutical corporations
					or the corrupt governments of developing countries. Yet,
					medical care in most African countries is so poor that
					there is no dearth of volunteers for drug trials in sub-
					Saharan Africa because, for most, that is the only
					mechanism to get any treatment. This abject vulnerability
					can be and will be exploited unless strong international
					measures are in place to protect the subjects.
				</p>
				<p>
					The debate pits idealism against pragmatism. Economic
					considerations should not be paramount but neither can
					one proceed as if they do not exist. If the research
					requirements are made too stringent and economically
					unattractive, then few will conduct research trials in the
					Third world, particularly for diseases that do not affect a
					large segment of the western population. This will hurt
					the people of the third world more than those in western
					countries as Third world governments have neither the
					financial resources nor the will to pursue vigorous
					scientific research even for problems unique to their
					environment. The Helsinki Declaration sets a level of care,
					Schuklenk argues for the spirit of Helsinki: that research
					participants are protected from exploitation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is more important to address the shortcomings in WMA
					as well as the consensus approach as detailed by Lie et al.
					and Schuklenk. The World Medical Association is made
					up of representatives from national medical associations
					of 82 countries with eight million physicians. While the
					participation of physicians in developing international
					guidelines for human research is crucial, it leaves out
					large segments of international society with a major stake
					in research ethics. What is needed is an international body
					with broad representation to develop internationally
					applicable guidelines, a mechanism for ongoing review
					of multinational research (particularly when such
					research is being conducted in a developing country
					without adequate intellectual and material resources to
					monitor such research), and a mechanism to implement
					corrective measures where needed. As both Lie and
					Schuklenk have pointed out, WMA cannot provide the
					necessary structure and oversight. Only WHO fits the bill.
