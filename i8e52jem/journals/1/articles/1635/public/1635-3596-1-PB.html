					The Forum for Medical Ethics Society and Moral Re-armament (India) jointly  organised an international conference on ethical values in health care, at  Panchgani, India, on January 2, 3 and 4, 1998. Participants held in-depth  discussions of several aspects of the principles and practice of health care  ethics, with special reference to India, Pakistan and the Scandinavian  countries, and referred to various international and Indian codes and concerns.  Their recommendations follow:
				</p>
				<p>
					Considerable and sustained effort is needed to improve the  present unsatisfactory state of health care practices. It is especially  necessary to include, foster and develop a keen sense of moral values in all  personnel engaged in promoting health or treating disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					The absence of effectivity and efficiency in our watchdogs and  regulatory agencies within our professions is deeply felt and must be  corrected. Failure to do so will force the creation of external agencies by  society, the government or the judiciary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst the medical professions and the pharmaceutical and  medical supplies industries are interdependent, both parties need to halt  unethical practices aimed at benefiting selected individual doctors and the  industry at increased costs to the patient. It is vital that meetings, seminars  and conferences at five-star hotels, lavish expenditure on doctors and their  families and gifts in cash or kind to them be stopped. Professional  organisations should raise funds from their own members, government,  grant-giving agencies, independent charitable trusts and other similar sources  that do not create a conflict of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is need for discussion and debates within the health care  professions and between them and the intelligentsia in society at large for the  evolution of practical guidelines on the ethical care of seriously ill patients  in the face of shortages of equipment, personnel and finance. Special attention  should be paid to the needs of the disenfranchised; how expensive intensive  care should be rationed, and when doctors and nurses should withhold or  withdraw intensive care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Humans form the most important resource of the health care  system. Health care teams must demonstrate a commitment to the dignity and  worth of human life. Although each member of the team is responsible for the  individual's actions, the team must take collective responsibility for all  actions as has admirably been practised by SEWA RURAL, an NGO from Gujarat. All  members of the team are equal and for the team to perform in the best interest  of patients and the community it is essential that members demonstrate mutual  respect.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst it is recognised that each member of the health care team  has a specialised role with limitations, the paramount consideration of the  welfare of the patient demands that each member does all that is possible to  care for and help the patient. In life-or-death situations, it may be necessary  for a given member of the team to go well beyond the normal range of  responsibilities to save life. The use of adefibrillator by a nurse is an  example. Under such circumstances, the principle of collective responsibility  of the entire health care team must support and protect the individual acting  in the best interests of the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					The curriculum for all members of the health care team must include,  in addition to relevant medical and paramedical training, instruction in  psychology, sociology, health care economics, skill in communication,  philosophy of medicine and ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to have common and periodic continuing education  programmes where all members of the team interact.
				</p>
				<p>
					The right to death in peace, without pain, is indisputable.  Everything possible must be done to ensure that the dying person is in comfort,  amidst loved ones as the end approaches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Terminating life by medical means is not permitted by Indian  law. Given the sorry state of medical practices in several countries and the  danger of the slippery slope, society should not give health care workers the  sanction to end life. Instead, we must give emphasis to care which preserves  human dignity and the meaning of life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical research must be primarily relevant to the needs of the  country and must conform to the highest ethical standards. Researchers must  make a special effort to avail of native wisdom born of tradition and  experience. It is also necessary to document alternative medical practices  through research, as is being done by the Foundation for Research into  Community Health, and incorporate all that is useful in the formulation and  achievement of their goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every health care institution must have an ethics committee  composed of representatives from each of the health care professions, the  administration and the representatives of society, especially from the legal  and teaching professions. This committee must encourage reporting - anonymously  if necessary - of deficiencies and malpractices within the institution so that  corrective action can be taken.
				</p>
				<p>
					The solution to most environmental problems and the provision of  a significant number of preventive, promotive and curative measures in rural  areas can emerge from health workers selected from the local population. A  social revolution can be brought about by strengthening and assisting local  panchayats and empowering rural women through education and specialised training.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health care professionals, co-operating responsibly with the  media, must inform, instruct and educate society on all matters concerning  health and disease. Concerted effort is needed to promote measures that prevent  disease, overcome deep-rooted prejudices (as against autopsies) and facilitate  beneficent measures such as the periodic donation of blood during life and  corneas and organs after death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Neglect of the health of women will have a deleterious,  cascading effect on the nation. Empowering women through education, and  engagement in economic activity, is the key to improving the health and  productivity of their families. It is important that the nation invests in  women. Health care professionals must do all that is possible to ensure  adequate care and education of the girl child and woman.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are categories of individuals who require special  application of all our qualities of head, heart and hands: the poor, prisoners,  and those facing ostracism by society on account of their illness (leprosy,  HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis). It is incumbent on all members of the health care team  to ensure that the principles of justice, beneficence non-maleficeance and  confidentiality are especially respected in their cases. We must keep in mind  at all times that our primary responsibility is towards our patients. We owe  responsibility to law enforcement, prison and government agencies, but this  must give way in priority to our primary responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					All health care institutions need regular, periodic audit of  prescription practices, morbidity and mortality, and of the quality of patient  care (social audit). The findings of these audits must be open to public  inspection. It is important to ensure minimal standards of care to all patients  whilst attempting to provide an optimal mix of general and intensive care.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is essential to set up and ensure minimal standards in  nursing homes, intensive care units in the private sector, and investigation  laboratories. The present, unsatisfactory, ad hoc proliferation of these institutions  has resulted in a wide variation in the standard of facilities offered at  considerable cost. A system of certification and periodic re-accreditation of  these institutions is mandatory with unsatisfactory units being forced to shut  down.

				<h4>Quinacrine sterilisation banned</h4>
				<p>
					On March 18, 1998, the Drug  Controller of India gave a written commitment to the supreme court that the use  of the drug quinacrine would be banned as a method of female sterilisation in  India.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the court refused the  petitioners' plea to follow up on the 30,000 Indian women sterilised by this  unapproved method.

				<h4>Workshop on human rights and medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The department of  civics and politics, University of Mumbai, held a two-day workshop on human  rights and medical ethics on February 7 and 8, 1998. Participants included  health activists, health researchers, lawyers and doctors. The four sessions covered human rights and health, rights and responsibilities of doctors, rights  and responsibilities of patients, and organ transplant.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kannamma Raman of the  university introduced the topic of human rights. Pritam Phatnani highlighted  the importance of preserving-medical records, handing only signed photocopies to patients or the  police. K A Dinshaw, director of Tata Memorial Centre, pointed out that  patients often take away original records.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arun Bal, medical  activist, noted that nearly 90 per cent of complaints against doctors are  instigated by other doctors. Due to a virtual failure in the doctor-patient  relationship, confused patients often file complaints based on stray comments  from other medical personnel in public hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Amar Jesani of the  Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes spoke on the relevance, to the  medical
				</p>
				<p>
					profession, of various international conventions on human rights, with special  reference to torture victims, HIVpositive people and prisoners. Doctors have  been known to remain silent despite knowing that torture has taken place,  sometimes falsifying medical information to this end, usually under compulsion.  This will continue until prison medical services become independent of the  prison.
				</p>
				<p>
					Manu Kothari of KEM  hospital attacked the needless use of technical and surgical interventions in  medical treatment. VN Acharya described most ICCUs as mere status symbols. Anil  Pilgaonkar suggested that private practitioners display a certificate listing  unethical procedures that they would NOT do in their clinic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The law permitting  cadaver transplant was expected to increase the number of such transplant procedures,  doing away with the unethical buying and selling of organs. Sanjay Nagral of  KEM hospital noted that Indian reservations about cadaver transplants have  restricted the use of this ethical procedure. Dr Subhash Salunke, Maharashtra  director of health, stated that the government had permitted 780 live  transplants after confirming that there were no financial deals between donor  and recipient.
