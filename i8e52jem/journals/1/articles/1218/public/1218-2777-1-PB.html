					David Kern discovered a cluster of cases of  interstitial lung disease among employees of Microfibres Inc. a synthetic  textile manufacturing company in Rhode Island <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kern David G. The unexpected result of an investigation of an outbreak of occupational lung disease. Int J Occup Environ Health 1998;4:19-32." id="1">(1)</a>. Dr Kern was head of the  department of occupational and environmental health at Brown University's  school of medicine, Rhode Island, USA. At first accepted as consultants by the  plant management, the team met increasing resistance to its efforts as it  uncovered evidence of work-related causes of the disease and attempted to  communicate its findings to both workers and the union. Ultimately the plant's  management dismissed the occupational medicine team and threatened legal action  if it presented or published its scientific findings. Both the hospital and  university administrators attempted to thwart the team's efforts to publish its  findings, and colluded in summarily terminating the occupational health  programme and Dr Kern's employment contract.

					The Kern saga illustrates the conflict-prone nature  of the practice of occupational medicine. Even if one tries to ignore the  politics, the potential for conflict is ever present. Private medical schools  struggling for funds depend on industry. Hence it is not surprising that the  services of Dr Kern were terminated. He got a lot of support online from  professionals all over the world, but in the end it was business as usual for  the company. In Bangkok, Thailand, Dr Orapun was head of the occupational  health department, a governmental body. She recorded cases of lead poisoning  among workers of the multinational company Seagate that manufactures PC hard  disks. The Thai government sacked Dr Orapun and her staff and shut down the  occupational health department.

					The above two incidents, one each from a developed  and a developing country, are common wherever economic motives prevail and  workers are put at risk for the sake of 'competitiveness'. Threats of factory  closure or relocation are made to hold off investments required to address  health risks.

					In newly industrialised economies like South Korea,  the situation is very bad for the occupational health physician. Let us take  one example. A series of cases of carbon-di-sulphide poisoning was noticed in  the Wonjin Rayon plant which had been imported into south Korea from Japan in  the 1960s. Dr Rokho Kim served as an independent medical consultant in the  case. Some victims were compensated after a long drawn-out struggle between the  union and the management. One worker, who had been diagnosed as Carbon  -di-sulpfide poisoning by Dr Kim, was denied access to medical treatment by a  new medical committee (set up after the government thought that Dr Kim was too  close to the workers), and hence died of cerebral haemorrhage within two  months. After the worker died, it became a public scandal when the widow  refused to have a funeral, but instead decided to stage a sit-in demonstration  with other poisoned workers, placing her husband's coffin in front of the company  gates. The sit-in lasted four months and faced severe police atrocities.

					Dr Kim's performance as an occupational physician  was at odds with the interests of business and the authoritarian government.  His harassment continued for many years. When he was to leave for Boston for  his doctoral training, at the last minute he was stopped at the airport and his  passport confiscated. He was forced to co-operate in his own investigation. He  was brought to a cell in a secret police building in central Seoul for questioning.  It was a notorious torture chamber. (In 1987, a college student was tortured to  death by drowning in such a cell.) There was a one-way mirror at the door where  superiors taped the interview for review. All this was done without a warrant.  He was asked about his college friends and asked repeatedly if he was a  communist (professing communist ideas is illegal under the National Security  law of South Korea). The accusations ranged from questioning his editorial  writings (purportedly containing socialistic ideas) to alleging that he had  instigated the company to go on strike. His family members also were questioned  and humiliated. Many years later he was cleared of all accusations except one:  the crime of 'interfering with business'.

					In India even though our law does not penalise the  person for diagnosing an occupational disease, doctors take the easy way out by  not issuing medical certificates that a disease was contracated as a result of  the person's occupational risk. In 1995, to take one example there was no  occupational disease recorded in the annual report of the Workmen's'  Compensation Act <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Annual review of the Workmen's Compensation Act, Government of India, 1995." id="2">(2)</a>. Studies sponsored by industry in medical colleges would  obviously not talk about occupational disease. Even if they do discover  occupational diseases in the course of the study, they are kept secret, and  this information is inaccessible even to the institution, leave alone the  affected worker. Hence in matters of occupational and environmental health,  doctors must take sides if people and society are to benefit.
