				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					When evidence of trade  in organs for transplantation from live vendors reached attention in the West,  widely different groups indignantly denounced it. Restricting my remarks to  kidneys, I suggest that this indignation is misplaced.

					Those criticising the rich for greed appear to lose sight of the fact that  those seeking kidneys are dying individuals trying to save their lives. Each of  us will do everything we can to save our lives. If anything, spending money to  save one's life involves less greed than does spending money on luxuries.
				</p>
				<p>
					The critics' attitude  towards the poor selling organs is even odder. The young Turkish father swept  on to everyone's television screen wanted to sell his kidney to pay for urgent  hospital&nbsp; treatment for his daughter. By banning this sale, we deprive him  of his best option and leave him with one he considers even worse than the loss  of a kidney. Our indignation on behalf of the exploited poor seems to take the  curious form of making them even worse off, leaving behind a trail of people  dying who might have been saved and another of people desperate enough to offer  their organs who are thrust back into the wretchedness they were hoping to  alleviate. To respond that no one should be in these desperate situations is  idle and wishful thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us consider the  arguments against the sale of organs one by one.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Autonomy and consent</h4>
				<p>
					Many claim that there can be no genuine and free consent to the sale of organs.  It is argued that would-be organ vendors are poor, undereducated and  underprivileged and do not comprehend the risks. If this argument be expected,  such individuals should not be accepted to comprehend the risk of donating an  organ either. In either case, the solution lies not in banning the procedure  but in counselling and dispelling ignorance. Where there is genuine  incompetence to consent, someone competent must make a decision on their behalf  as is the prerequisite for any procedure with potentially serious consequences  such as abortion, AIDS testing or surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					Others argue that  would-be vendors are coerced by poverty and since coerced consent is not real,  the choice should not be allowed. Coercion is something that reduces the range  of options open to an individual, so there is a sense in which poverty can be  said to coerce people into selling their organs. The only way to remove this  coercion, however, is to widen their range of options, preferably by removing  their poverty. Banning the sale of the kidney only reduces the options still  further. To the coercion of poverty is added the coercion of the supposed  protector who comes and takes away the best that poverty has left. This cannot  be justified by concern for freedom and autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if this argument  did work, it would still make no distinction between sale and donation of an  organ. In the latter instance the coercion is the threat of impending death of  a relative, quite a potent form of coercion, you will agree. The logic is the  same.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also claimed that  vendors are coerced when they are made unrefusable offers of several times  their annual income. Such an offer, however, does not narrow the options open  to the individual. It broadens the range. The original options are still there.  If you ban such offers, you are constricting options, not removing a coercion.
				</p>

				<h4>Harm to the vendor</h4>
				<p>
					It is also said that  State paternalism grounded in social beneficence dictates that the abject poor  should be protected from selling parts of their bodies. Advocates of this idea  do not explain why the poor are misguided in their judgement that organ selling  is in their best interests. The assessment of the potential harm of losing a  kidney as weighed against the potential benefit of whatever payment is received  is, at best, not easy. The risks of hang gliding, rock climbing or diving from  North Sea oil rigs are much greater than those of nephrectomy. It is plausible  to say that the expected benefits will be much greater to the desperately poor  who see in selling a kidney the only hope of making anything of their wretched  lives and perhaps even of surviving, than to the relatively rich. If the rich  who take risks for pleasure or thrill of danger are not misguided, why are the  poor who take far lower risks for much higher returns considered irrational and  in need of saving from themselves?
				</p>
				<p>
					And again, if we could  reach the general conclusion that selling a kidney is bad, the argument applies  equally to donating one. If any aspect of organ selling is against the  interests of the vendor, it is not the gaining of money but the loss of a  kidney, and this loss is identical for do-nor and vendor. There is no reason to  presume that whatever the money is wanted for must matter less to the vendor  than saving the life of a relative must to a donor. The exchange of money is  not even an indicator, let alone a determinant, of the difference between  reasonable and unreasonable risk.
				</p>

				<h4>Harm to the recipient</h4>
				<p>
					Here the question is not  of whether the purchasers are less well served than they ought to be but of  whether they would be better off without the trade. Clearly most would not.  Even if treatment carries a significant risk of disease, the alternative for  most of these patients is certain death. Furthermore, even if the risk were not  worth taking in the present circumstances, that would be an objection only to  the inadequacy of control rather than to the trade as such.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Collateral damage</h4>
				<p>
					The trade is alleged to  be wrong because it treats parts of the body as purchasable commodities. We  should, however, guard against the common trick in rhetoric of using a term  carrying derogatory overtones without proving the grounds for such  condemnation. A fundamental issue of autonomy is involved here. Treating people  as commodities - with no say in their destinies &mdash; is vastly different from  letting them decide for themselves what to do with their own bodies. Whilst it  may be degrading to be in a state where organ selling is the best option left,  this does not mean that actually selling , the organ worsens the degradation.  On the contrary, many vendors may feel an increase in self-respect after what  is perceived as a duty done.

					The argument that such trade will invite social and economic corruption is  difficult to support as all available evidence only goes to show that these, in  fact, follow prohibition.

					It is said that if organs are bought from living vendors there will be no  incentive to overcome resistance to transplantation using organs from cadavers,  because people in positions of power will be able to buy kidneys and will have  no incentive to press for the cadaver programme. But it might be equally  claimed that since these very people are the ones who will respond with disgust  to the trade, its continuation might induce them to press even harder for  change.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Exploitation</h4>
				<p>
					An objection of a  different kind is that the trade must be stopped because it involves  exploitation. The poor are vulnerable to exploitation and they should be  protected. Stopping the trade, however, is still taking away the best option of  the poor, which makes it rather like trying to end the miseries of slum  dwelling by bulldozing slums or stopping the problems of in-growing toenails by  chopping off feet. We put an end to that particular evil, but only at the cost  of making things even worse for the sufferers.

					If our aim is the protection of the poor and we lack the will or the power to  remove the poverty that makes them exploitable in the first place, the next  best thing is to subject the trade to stringent controls.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					I find trade in organs as  intuitively repugnant as does everyone else but strong feelings of a moral  kind, by themselves, cannot form reliable guides for action. Remember the  traditional reactions to inter-racial marriage, unfeminine women and  homosexuality - themselves now widely regarded as repugnant? If we find the  trade repugnant because of the harm it does to vendors, we must find the idea  of making their situation worse by stopping the trade more repugnant. The worse  we think it is to sell a kidney, the more repugnant should we find any  objectively worse alternative. We should find it much more repugnant that the  Turkish father should be forced to keep his kidney and watch his daughter die  than that he should sell it and save her. We should also find our repugnance  proportionately lessened if we could assure high standards of care that would  make the harm minimal.
				</p>
				<p>
					This does not prove  conclusively that organ sales should be allowed; good arguments for prohibition  may still be found. The fact that so many bad arguments are used, however,  shows that good ones must be hard to come by, and it also suggests that our  strong feelings of repugnance are systematically distorting our arguments. We  are in effect treating the removal of our own feelings of disgust as more  important than the real interests of the people on whose behalf we claim to be  concerned. It is therefore morally essential to understand the power of these  feelings so that we can think impartially about the problem.

					In the meantime, until someone produces a far better argument than has yet  appeared, there seems to be no escaping the provisional conclusion that the  prohibition of the sale of organs does substantial harm of various sorts, that  these have not been shown to be justified and therefore that we should not be trying  to prevent the selling of organs but rather to lessen whatever harms are now  involved and to increase the benefits to both vendors and purchasers by getting  the trade properly regulated.
