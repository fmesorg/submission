              <h4>Change is inevitable</h4>
              <p>
                The  practice of medicine has undergone many changes over the years and will  continue to undergo many more changes &ndash; in concepts and in practice &ndash; in  future. It is, therefore, unrealistic and unfair to expect the medical  profession to accept and adopt all of the ethical principles that were laid  down years ago <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK. Advertising remains unethical even in the digital age. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 15." id="1">(1)</a>. Modifications must be made by the governing bodies and  physicians must accept the changes.
                </p>
              <p>
                I  propose that &mdash; as is the practice in the United States &mdash; doctors in India  should be allowed to advertise their services. Before I proceed further, let me  make it clear that I would personally not advertise: either because I find it  difficult to totally shake off old, established beliefs or because my own field  (pathology) does not require advertising. However, I would defend the right of  other physicians to advertise.
                </p>
              <p>
                Dr  Pandya argues that medical professionals have peer-reviewed journals to produce  their research papers in and thus 'advertise' themselves to their peers.  However, as he himself has pointed out some years ago <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK: Letter from Bombay: Why is the output of science from India low? British Medical Journal 1991; 301: 333." id="2">(2)</a>, Indian doctors  rarely publish. Moreover, Sahni et al <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sahni P et al. Indian medical journals. The Lancet 1992;39:1589-91." id="3">(3)</a> showed some years ago that only five  per cent of Indian doctors read medical journals. This avenue of spreading  information about oneself is thus blocked for most physicians.
                </p>
              <p>
                The  argument has been made that allowing advertising will permit doctors to make  tall claims. The cure, then is to make our medical councils, advertising  agencies, and the Advertising Standards Council of India more accountable.  Preventing advertising because of the existence of misleading advertising is  like banning cricket because of some matches are fixed. The solution is to  prevent the fixing, not the game.
                </p>
              <p>
                Finally,  the change in medicine is exemplified by the fact that many hospitals,  especially the private or corporate ones, have marketing departments. There  have even been suggestions that the word 'patient' be replaced by 'client' or  'customer' <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="What's in a name? The Lancet  (Editorial). 2000, 356: 2111." id="4">(4)</a>.
                </p>
              <p>
                But  this much is clear: change is inev itable. In an age when patients are  considered to be consumers and when doctors can be sued for poor services,  surely it is incorrect not to allow doctors to advertise. The same rules have  to apply to all the players of the game.
                </p>
