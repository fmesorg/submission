				<h4>Review of medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					This review identifies  significant issues, events and documents in discussions medical ethics relating  to end of life care, medical error, priority setting, biotechnology, and  medical ethics education, and anticipates two future issues, "eHealth" and  global bioethics. For example, regarding medical error, the US Institute of  Medicine's 1999 report on medical error and the Tavistock Group's draft  statement of "Shared ethical principles for everybody in health care" provide a  foundation for discussion. Reports by the US National Bioethics Advisory  Commission and the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics, are the latest in a series  of important consensus documents on biotechnology. In the area of medical ethics  education, two developments are the General Medical Council's requirement that  medical ethics be a core subject in the medical curriculum, and the Royal  College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada requirement that medical ethics be  taught as a condition of post-graduate accreditation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for future issues: the code of ethics for 'eHealth' addresses ethical issues  raised by the information technology revolution. And in the area of global  bioethics, there is the International Association of Bioethics and a discussion  board on global bioethics.

				<h4> Unlinked testing: informing the public</h4>
				<p>
					Unlinked anonymous testing for HIV has been used as a monitoring tool  in many countries. This UK survey on the public's view's on the practice, both  for HIV (where it has been carried out since 1989) and for other diseases,  found that less than one-third of those interviewed were aware of the practice,  and a little over 26 per cent disagreed with its use for HIV or for other  diseases; opposition was highest among those unaware of the policy. The author  suggests a reconsideration of the current policy. The epidemic has not  materialised as expected in the UK, the balance between the social usefulness  of the programme and the individual's right to determine what happens to his or  her blood has changed. All patients should know of the policy and the option of  opting out.
				</p>
				<p>
					In response to letters on this article, the authors emphasise that the issue  is: under what conditions is it acceptable not to let people (explicitly) know  what is happening with their tissue samples? Lack of openness could damage the  relationship between patients and health care workers.
				</p>
				<p>
					This discussion may seem esoteric to us in India, where linked, involuntary  testing for HIV is routinely done on in-patients in private and public  hospitals, and patients who test positive are refused treatment.

				<h4> Cheating in medical school</h4>
				<p>
					The editor of the BMJ reports on a complaint that a top student in the  UK caught referring to a clinical textbook during her exam was allowed to pass  her exams though honours she would have received were withheld. This triggered  off resentment among other students, and the complaint to the BMJ. The editor  argues that the student's actions cast doubt on her work in general. Also, the  authorities' actions send the wrong message to other students, and undermine  medical education and medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The flood of letters on this editorial express the full range of opinions, from  supporting the editor for his commitment to medical ethics to attacking him for  tarnishing the profession's good name, to questioning the examination system  itself. Three writers trained in India are interesting for their perspective.  One is shocked that cheating was condoned by the British.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another makes a  connection to the prevalence of cheating in medical schools in India. "Money  plays a huge part not only in the admission process, but also in the progress  through examinations... Of course there are upright, honest and decent people-but sadly they are not the majority." Yet another comments: "I trained at a  large state-run medical school in south India, and it did not take an editorial  in a major medical journal to make us aware that cheating amongst medical  students does occur. Most instances are dealt with sternly, but sensibly and  no, we do not quote "British standards" when we do."

				<h4> When there is no hope</h4>
				<p>
					Heated debate on the concept of medical futility in the late 1980s produced  a number of theories of action before receding into the background by the early  1990s.. At its basis was the idea that once doctors judged the futility of a  treatment they should be allowed to withhold treatment even over the patient's  objections. The debate was fueled by policies such as brain death definitions  gave hope a similar policy for futility, technological advances for prolonging  life, and health financing raised issues of cost. However, the issue has not  been adequately resolved.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discussions of futility can be grouped into four categories: attempts to define  medical futility, attempts to resolve the debate with the use of empirical  data, discussions that cast the debate as a struggle between the autonomy of  patients and the autonomy of physicians, and attempts to develop a process for  resolving disputes over futility.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors seem to conclude that the most productive approach has been to  develop frameworks within which physicians can discuss with patients and their  families the possibility that treatment would be futile. The process involves  assessing the goals of the physician, patient, and family; clarifying  information and beginning to negotiate; acknowledging differences in values;  and arriving at a compromise, sometimes with the help of ethics committees or  the courts. This approach led to the development of hospital and regional  policies for resolving conflicts over futility.

				<h4> The magic drug</h4>
				<p>
					The project to map the human genome has created a wave of optimism  about the future of gene therapy. The authors are less exuberant. The new  genetics will not revolutionise the way in which common diseases are identified  or prevented. Though mapping and sequencing the human genome will lead to the  identification of more genes causing Mendelian disorders such as Huntington's  Disease, and to the development of diagnostic and predictive tests for them,  this won't necessarily lead to the swift development of safe and effective  treatments.
				</p>
				<p>
					More important, only a small proportion of the population has mendelian disorders.  It has not been possible so far to find a strong genetic link for asthma,  hypertension, and so on. Even where a link has been found for breast cancer, or  Alzheimer's disease, the gene accounts for a small percentage of all cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tailoring treatment to genotypes sounds better than it is possible or useful.  And the value of testing depends on the test, the prevalence of the condition,  the availability of effective treatment, and the value the public sees in it  all.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors write: "In  our rush to fit medicine with the genetic mantle, we are losing sight of other  possibilities for improving the public health... Differences in social structure,  lifestyle, and environment account for much larger proportions of disease than  genetic differences... Those who make medical and science policies in the next  decade would do well to see beyond the hype."

				<h4> Altruistic organ donation</h4>
				<p>
					The authors discuss the basis of their centre's policy on "non-directed  donation": donation of a kidney to anyone on the waiting list for a cadaveric  organ. The policy covers evaluation of donors to assess their competence to  make an informed decision; selection of recipients; evaluation of recipients;  interval between evaluation and surgery to allow the donor to reconsider;  special considerations such as different requirements of the donor, recipient  and transplant group; and long-term follow-up. Four such transplants have been  carried out since the policy was instituted.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors note that the policy raises two major ethical questions: is the  transplantation of organs from living donors is ethically justified and, if so,  under what conditions? Better survival rates with living donors, long waits for  a cadaveric kidney, and psychological benefits to the donor must be weighed  against the physical risks to the donor. Second, is the balance between risks  and benefits altered in non-directed donations by the element of altruism?
				</p>
				<p>
					They argue that such donors are not under any pressure; donors are known to  experience increased self-esteem, the risk of morbidity is low, and their  health is similar to or better than that of the general population.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors describe the process of allocating organs as based on an attempt to  balance two potentially competing objectives: maximising the probability of a  successful outcome and making allocation equitable. Hence potential recipients  were limited to patients in need of a first or second transplant, excluding  those with a history of noncompliance with medical regimens, and the  transplantation had to be performed at our institution.

				<h4> Insurance for whom?</h4>
				<p>
					Will the entry of the private sector into the insurance industry bring  better health care for Indians? The author suggests that this is not likely, at  least not in the short run. It does not guarantee that people will be protected  financially, or in terms of better health. Internationally, private insurance  has not worked without proper regulation. The regulatory structure described in  the Insurance Regulatory and Authority (IRDA) Bill is not enough.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even 10 years after the government introduced health insurance, barely 0.2% of  the population was covered by its policies. Private insurance schemes will not  make a dramatic overall difference to this percentage, and even this will be  concentrated in urban areas. Second, insurance tends increase health  expenditures without necessarily improving the quality of care &mdash; and there are  no serious efforts to regulate the private health sector. At the same time, the  insurance company will try to keep costs down even if it means depriving the  person of care. Finally, private insurance will not address the question of  economic inequity &mdash; whether it is making the poor pay beyond their means for  insurance or for out-of-pocket expenses, or whether it is reducing access to  those most likely to get sick.

				<h4>From the inside, looking out</h4>
				<p>
					This issue of the Hastings Center Report carries a series of essays looking  at frailties within the doctor-patient relationship. In addition to looking at  the change over time from a benevolent 'dictatorship', the topics discussed  examine the tendency of providers to blame their patients for the disease,  special problems when the patient is from another culture and speaks another  language, or how the doctor should fulfill her responsibilities in the  patient's best interests when the patient expresses racist views. Finally, an  essay by a medical researcher describes the special problems of truly  respecting the interests of patients in phase I (toxicity) clinical trials for  cancer drugs, in which the drugs are unlikely to be therapeutic, but in which  some patients may receive toxic doses. Individual essays will be discussed in  the next issue of IME.
