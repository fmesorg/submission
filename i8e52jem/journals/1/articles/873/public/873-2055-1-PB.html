					India is currently one of only 83 countries retaining the death penalty. In  India, the death penalty is imposed by way of hanging or shooting. Recently,  the Law Commission of India circulated a document entitled 'Consultation Paper  on Mode of Execution of Death Sentence and Incidental Matter'. This document  contained a questionnaire polling opinions on methods of execution. The  questionnaire however, neither questions the use of the death penalty itself  nor whether this method of punishment is necessary and justified.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 'Consultation Paper'  has been confined mainly to the following three issues: the method of execution  in the death sentence; the process of elimination of difference in judicial  opinion among judges of the apex court in passing the sentence of death  penalty; and the need to provide to the accused a right of appeal to the  Supreme Court in such cases.

				<h4>Method  of execution</h4>
				<p>
					In India, the death  sentence is currently executed through hanging or shooting. The Criminal  Procedure Code dictates that hanging should be the mode of execution and the  Army Act, Navy Act, and Air Force Act dictate that the mode of execution for  all persons sentenced to death should be shooting.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Deena V. Union of  India (1983)4 SCC 645, the apex court held that the execution of death should  satisfy the following criteria:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						It should be as quick and simple as  possible.
					</li>
					<li>
						The act of  execution should produce immediate unconsciousness passing quickly into death.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should be  decent.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should not  involve mutilation.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Execution by hanging  does not meet any of these requirements. There have been several cases reported  where hanging has not immediately resulted in a broken neck and thus the  convict is left to slowly strangle to death. This strangling results in the convict's  eyes popping almost out of his head, his tongue swelling up and protruding from  his mouth. In cases where the neck is in fact broken, the rope often tears  large portions of the convict's flesh and muscle from that side of the face  where the noose is. In many cases, the convict will end up urinating on himself  and defaecating before death. The prisoner remains dangling from the end of the  rope for 8-14 minutes before a doctor climbs up a small ladder and listens to  his heartbeat with a stethoscope and pronounces him dead. Given these facts, it  is clear that hanging is neither a quick and simple nor a decent method of  execution as it involves mutilation of the body and, in some cases, prolonged  suffering and torture before death.

					Lethal injection is the  method of execution currently being contemplated by the Law Commission. The  proposition for using this method was first introduced in a medico- legal  journal in New York, USA in 1888. In 1977, this proposition was re-introduced  by Dr Stanley Deutsch, of the Oklahoma Medical School. Lethal injection is the  primary method of execution used in the USA. As per the description provided in  the Consultation Paper of the Law Commission, this method of execution involves  the prisoner being secured on a gurney with lined ankle and wrist restraints. A  cardiac monitor and a stethoscope are attached to the prisoner, and two saline  intravenous lines are started, one in each arm. The saline intravenous lines  are turned off, and sodium thiopental is injected, causing the inmate to fall  into a deep sleep. The second chemical agent, pancuronium bromide, a muscle  relaxant, follows. This causes the inmate to stop breathing due to paralyses of  the diaphragm and lungs. Finally, potassium chloride is injected, stopping the  heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					This method, of all  those available, appears to be the quickest and least painful. However, the  reality is that even this method can result in cruel and unusual suffering.  Amnesty International has documented numerous 'botched' executions involving  lethal injection. The case of Scott Carpenter, who was executed in Oklahoma on  May 18, 1997 serves as a prime example of this. Two minutes after the injection  was administered, Carpenter started making noises; his stomach and chest had  'palpitations', and his body suffered 26 violent convulsions in the process. He  was officially declared dead only 11 minutes after the injections were first  administered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The role of doctors in  all methods of execution is very important. In cases where execution is by  hanging, the doctors only check whether the person is actually dead or not. In  cases of lethal injection, a medical expert is required to administer the  injection and as such the doctor is directly involved in the execution. In  these cases, the line between a medical practitioner and an executioner is  crossed. Internationally, there have been many medical associations that have  taken a stand that no medical practitioner should be asked to take part in  bringing about the death of a convict. The British Medical Association held  that it was opposed to any proposal to introduce a method of execution that  would require the services of a medical practitioner.
				</p>
				<p>
					The principle behind  this reasoning is that the medical profession is intended to save lives, not to  bring an end to them. It seems only appropriate that the Indian Medical  Association and all other Indian organizations responsible for the practice of  medicine in this country should state their position on this issue and convey  their sentiments to the Law Commission of India. Our medical practitioners,  sworn to protect lives, should not be participating in the execution of any  individual, whatever the circumstances. A statement of this kind on the part of  medical associations would greatly advance the move for complete abolition of  the death penalty in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been proven  through research that the death penalty does not functionally act as a  deterrent to violent crime. The crime rate in Canada, where the death penalty  was abolished in 1998, has substantially reduced since the abolition. At the  same time, in the USA, a country where the socioeconomic climate is very  similar to that of Canada but which has retained the death penalty, the crime  rate has been consistently on the rise for a number of years.

				<h4>Unanimity  in decision</h4>
				<p>
					It is essential, in  cases where the penalty is so severe, that there be unanimity among the judges  awarding the death penalty. However, there are often differences of opinion  among apex court judges in such hearings. Even if only a minority of the judges  differ in their opinion, in these cases it is not reasonable to impose the  death penalty. Rather, such convicts should be granted life imprisonment.  However small the voice of opposition may be among the judges, such convicts  should be granted some form of mercy.
				</p>

				<h4>Right  to appeal</h4>
				<p>
					It is of utmost  importance that in all cases where the death sentence is imposed or confirmed  by the High Court there must be an automatic appeal made directly to the  Supreme Court. Every convict who is facing a death sentence is entitled to a  chance to appeal his conviction and save himself from the gallows. There are  many mitigating circumstances that may have resulted in a person being wrongly  convicted and sentenced to death. The accused may be poor and may not have  received competent representation at the time of the trial. In any case where  the state is electing to execute and thus terminate the life of one of its  citizens the decision must be confirmed, as a matter of prudence, by the  highest court of the land, and that too, unanimously.
				</p>
				<p>
					The death penalty has  existed since the beginning of recorded history. In all this time, it has never  proven to be effective as a deterrent to crime in the way that popular  perception would have it. No method of executing a human being can be termed as  decent and humane because killing, whether it is done by the state or by an  individual, constitutes an inhumane act in and by itself. The only humane  solution that the Law Commission should offer the Government of India is the complete  abolition of the death penalty.
