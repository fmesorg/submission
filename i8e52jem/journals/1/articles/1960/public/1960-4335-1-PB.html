				<h4>Medical tuitions - a  viewpoint</h4>
				<p>
					A recent article lamented the growth of private coaching classes and medical  tuitions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhok P: Medical tuitions Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5: 23" id="1">(1)</a>. The world has changed considerably since the years of our fathers  and grandfathers. Old paradigms and situations no longer necessarily work or  hold true. In this context, the concept of medical tuitions needs to be examined  with all its socio-economic ramifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do students go for tuitions? There are  several reasons.
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						The student wants to get a high score or a  distinction.
					</li>
					<li>
						The student wants to pass.
					</li>
					<li>
						The student is coerced by the teacher into  getting tuitions under threat that she/he will otherwise fail.
					</li>
					<li>
						The parents are apprehensive about the  student's future and force her/him to take tuition.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The competition for postgraduate seats is cut-throat and in this scenario every mark counts. Students believe that special  coaching will help them get those extra marks and they are willing to pay for  this. To go one step back, if students are willing to pay any amount to get  question papers in the XIIth standard, paying for knowledge seems to be a very  innocuous act. To go one step forward, students are, in fact, now willing to  pay huge sums for those tuitions which guarantee them 'hot tips', 'sure  questions' or the marks they want. Parents, too, are willing to go to any  length to ensure that their child does not get left behind. This reflects the  general attitude of middleand upper class society where child-child rivalry and  competitiveness are marked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other factor is that students have got  used to tuition classes from the time they were in school and junior college, where  tuitions are <em>de rigeur </em>and raise no eyebrows. There are special tuition classes for  entrance examinations to medical colleges so why is there any surprise at crash  courses before students appear for their MD or MS examinations?
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical tuitions serve a purpose. The  standards of teaching in our medical colleges leaves a lot to be desired. There  is no uniformity in what is taught in the various institutions. Private medical  colleges are abysmally poor. B y distributing information -- albeit theoretical  -- uniformly, tuition classes give the students a sense of direction.  Knowledge, howsoever acquired, is beneficial.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with tuition classes lies not in  their-existence but in the manner in which they are conducted. Doctors who are  potential examiners have no business taking tuitions as they will obviously  favour their students when appointed examiners. They will subvert the  examination system to achieve their means. It is here that the authorities  (University of Bombay, Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, Government of  Maharashtra) have to step in. This, however, is an unlikely event, given the  manner in which they function.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical tuition is a variant of the prevalent  theme-private enterprise taking over the function of what should be an efficient  public service because of an obvious need. Special coaching of bright students  and clinics during the night, after the day's work has been completed, have  been going on for ages. We now have institutionalisation of this  extracurricular teaching and the addition of stiff costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where do ethics come in? All we need is  regulation and, perhaps, even accreditation of these classes by a regulatory  agency such as the University of Bombay or the College of Physicians and  Surgeons.
