				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are disease specific  questionnaires that are being increasingly used in clinical practice and  research. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis  Index (WOMAC), is a widely used PROM in patients with hip or knee  osteoarthritis. A validated WOMAC was used by us, and significant  challenges were faced in administering it as several questions did not  have a cultural connect. Functionally equivalent items in the Indian  context had then to be used to complete the score. With greater emphasis  today on the use of patient-reported outcome measures, and with data  from multi-centric studies being pooled, cross-cultural adaptation  becomes very important if the pooled data are to be really relevant. In  India, with several languages being spoken, and a significant proportion  of the population being illiterate, the physician and/ or the impartial  witness must provide considerable explanation without attempting to  influence the response. The key to the effective and correct use of  PROMs thus lies not just in translation, but also in a stepwise  validation of the questionnaire, and modification in the context of the  country where it is used. Scores like WOMAC are often primary efficacy  endpoints in clinical trials; are gaining greater importance to support  label claims; have ethical implications, and directly impact regulatory  decision making and thus, eventually, evidence-based practice.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are being increasingly  used in clinical practice and research. These are questionnaires that  are to be completed by study participants and their use as important  tools in clinical research is demonstrated by initiatives such as the  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).

The WOMAC is self administered and  multidimensional; it has 24 items grouped into three dimensions: pain  (five items), stiffness (two items), and physical function (17 items). The pain subscale includes five questions on the degree of pain  experienced with certain positions and activities; the function subscale  includes 17 questions on the degree of difficulty experienced while  completing activities while the stiffness subscale includes two  questions on severity of stiffness. WOMAC produces one aggregate total  score and scores for each of the subscales, with a higher score for each  subscale indicating a worse condition.

				<p>
					The authors are currently part of a multi-centric study in India  that is using the WOMAC as an index of efficacy in a study on  osteoarthritis. The English language (United Kingdom) version of the  WOMAC is being used, as also the linguistically translated and validated  versions in Hindi and Marathi (the two most commonly spoken local  languages in Mumbai) <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bellamy N.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					At the point of writing this paper, the scale has been  administered to seven patients, one of whom is illiterate. Two patients  were administered the Hindi version, one the English language scale and  the remaining four, the Marathi version.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					At the start of the study, we found that the time taken for completion of the WOMAC ranged from 15 minutes to 60 minutes (the latter being the time taken by the illiterate patient). The authors found that with the physical function subscale, several questions did not have a  cultural connect. These included the putting on or taking off of  stockings, getting in and out of a car, getting in and out of a bath  tub, and the ease of using a Western toilet. Since completion of the  entire score was envisaged as being necessary for evaluation, the  authors themselves had to give functionally equivalent items relevant in  the Indian context to explain to the patient, who then answered the  question. For example, instead of "putting on or taking off of  stockings" we asked about wearing a <em>"churidar"</em> which is an Indian  type of leg hugging garment. We substituted "getting in and out of a car" with getting in and out of a "rickshaw" which is the common  transport vehicle used by our patients. As illiterate participants were  not excluded from this study, an impartial witness read out the  translated version to our one illiterate patient, who then answered it  with the physician attending the process.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					There is much emphasis today on using standardised and validated  research instruments as these enable comparison of results both within  and across countries. A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is an umbrella  term that covers a whole range of potential types of measurement; it is  used specifically to refer to measures that quantify a patient's state  of health in terms of outcomes reported by himself/ herself. The common  feature of PROMs is their grounding in the patient's perspective. PROMs  are increasingly seen as complementary to biomedical measures and they  are being incorporated more frequently into clinical trials and clinical  practice. When they are used, there is the underlying assumption that  the use of a validated instrument ensures that it increases the  certainty with which the instrument accurately reflects what it is  supposed to measure <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gjersing L, Caplehorn JR, Clausen T.

					A review of literature on the use of the WOMAC, a patient-reported  outcome, shows that while several authors have successfully used  translated versions, others have faced difficulty <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title=" Nadrian H, Moghimi N, Nadrian E, Moradzadeh R, Bahamanpour K, Iranpour A, Bellamy N.

Guermazi et al  found that when the WOMAC was translated into Arabic from English,  eight questions of the physical function subscale had insufficient  psychometric properties and had to be excluded. They suggested the use  of Sfax WOMAC, where the physical function subscale was modified for use  in Tunisia <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Faik A, Benbouazza K, Amine B, Maaroufi H, Bahiri R, Lazrak N, Aboukal R, Hajjaj-Hassouni N.

					Callahan et al in an interesting study analysed various  quantitative measures of inflammatory activity and joint damage,  including articular, radiographic, laboratory, questionnaire, and  physical function measures, and correlated these measures with survival  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a cohort of patients  monitored in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. They found that the most  significant marker for predicting premature mortality over five years in  patients with RA was in fact a PROM that measured functional capacity  rather than currently available laboratory tests, radiographs, or other  imaging data <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Callahan LF, Pincus T, Huston JW 3rd, Brooks RH, Nance EP Jr, Kaye JJ. Measures of activity and damage in rheumatoid arthritis: depiction of changes and prediction of mortality over 5 years. Arth Care Res. 1997 Dec;10(6):381-94." id="11">(11)</a>. Sokka et al found that the Health Activity  Questionnaire, a PROM that quantifies disabilities in activities of  daily living predicted mortality both in patients with rheumatoid  arthritis and community controls <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sokka T, Hakkinen A, Krishnan E, Hannonen P. Similar prediction of mortality by the health assessment questionnaire in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the general population. Ann Rheum Dis. 2004 May;63(5):494-97." id="12">(12)</a>. Thus, in a country like India,  instruments like the WOMAC have significant ethical implications for  several reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					Linguistically translated versions are not the same as those that  have undergone cross-cultural adaptation; the latter being needed when  the scale is used in another country, language and setting <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Breugelmans R. Dangers in using translated medical questionnaires: the importance of conceptual equivalence across languages and cultures in patient-reported outcome measures. Chest. 2009 Oct;136(4):1175-7." id="13">(13)</a>. In  India, there are 22 officially recognised languages. Data in  multi-centric studies are ultimately pooled and, thus, cross-cultural  adaptation is necessary for each one of these languages if the pooled  data are to be really relevant. A large (17%) proportion of the  population in the state of Maharashtra is illiterate <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India[Internet]. Census of India, Provisional population totals paper 1 of 2011: Maharashtra. New Delhi: Government of India; 2011[cited 2013 Jan 21]. Chapter 6: Literacy; p 49-56. Available from: http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/maharastra/9%20-%20Chapter%206.pdf" id="14">(14)</a> and thus,  instruments do not truly become self-administered if the physician and  /or impartial witness must provide considerable explanation without  attempting to influence the response. The instruments are also primarily  developed with the assumption of some baseline literacy and hence there  is the risk that illiterate participants or those with low literacy are  excluded from both development of the instrument and its ultimate  application <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kroll T, Wyke S, Jahagirdar D, Ritchie K. If patient-reported outcome measures are considered key health-care quality indicators, who is excluded from participation? Health Expect. 2012 Apr 19; doi: 10. 1111/j. 1369-7625. 2012. 00772. x. [Epub ahead of print]" id="15">(15)</a>. Should we, for instance in this study, have at all  administered the WOMAC to the illiterate patient given that every  question was read out by the impartial witness and the questionnaire  thus did not become truly patient-reported? On the other hand, excluding  illiterate participants would lead to selection bias and also deny the  benefits of participation to someone who wishes to participate. Yet  another challenge is that investigators in India, though proficient in  English, may not necessarily be proficient in all 22 languages spoken in  the country with their multiple dialects; hence they accept the  sponsor's translated version of the questionnaire and use it without  much thought as to its cultural adaptation. Members of Institutional  Review Boards (IRBs) that review the translations also tend to look at  whether or not the language is likely to be understood by a lay person  rather than whether the translated version matches the original in all  respects.

					Over the last 15 years, there has been discussion on how to  interpret change in patient-reported outcomes and this has led to the  development of methods for identifying a minimum important difference  (MID). A MID is defined as the smallest change in respondent scores that  represents clinical, as opposed to merely statistical, significance,  and which would -- other things being equal -- warrant a change in a  patient's care <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Norman GR, Sloan JA, Wyrwich KW. Interpretation of changes in health-related quality of life: the remarkable universality of half a standard deviation. Med Care. 2003 May;41(5):582-92." id="16">(16)</a>. In studies that use PROMs like the WOMAC as a  single or even key dependent variable, their measurement becomes vital.  When used without cultural adaptation or in illiterate patients, the  PROM does not really measure what it is supposed to measure, which can  have serious consequences on the effectiveness of clinical  interventions; decisions about appropriate patient care and policy and  future research are driven by these measurements <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hobart JC, Cano SJ, Zajicek JP, Thompson AJ. Rating scales as outcome measures in clinical trials in neurology: Problems, solutions and recommendations. Lancet Neurol. 2007 Dec;6(12):1094-105" id="17">(17)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where do we go from here? The key to the effective and right use  of PROMs lies not just in translation, but a step-wise validation of the  questionnaire and modification where necessary in the context of the  country where it is used; and this has grown into a field of study in  its own right. The American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons Outcomes  Committee has laid down a five-step process for the cross-cultural  validation of questionnaires <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India[Internet]. Census of India, Provisional population totals paper 1 of 2011: Maharashtra. New Delhi: Government of India; 2011[cited 2013 Jan 21]. Chapter 6: Literacy; p 49-56. Available from: http://censusindia.gov.in/2011-prov-results/data_files/maharastra/9%20-%20Chapter%206.pdf" id="14">(14)</a>. In the case of funded studies,  sponsors often pay a considerable amount of money for obtaining these  linguistically translated questionnaires. It is our recommendation that  time, effort and money should also be spent by sponsors in  cross-cultural adaptation which will then ensure that the instrument  truly measures what it is supposed to measure. Also, then, data  collected across wide geographic locations with disparate cultural  contexts would become amenable to being pooled for analysis. In  addition, for studies done in countries with low literacy rates or where  illiterate patients are likely participants, a validated and culturally  adapted audio recording can be made which the patient hears and  subsequently answers. Both of these will then ensure that the US FDA's  definition that a PROM "is a measure that comes directly from the  patient without interpretation of the patient's response by the  clinician or anyone else" is satisfied. We believe that the scenario  would be similar in China and Latin America where large numbers of  studies are now carried out. Finally, both investigators and IRBs need  to realise that use of translations alone is not adequate and attempts  should be made, wherever possible, to make the PROM culturally relevant.  This is particularly important as patient related outcome measures ike  WOMAC are often primary efficacy endpoints in clinical trials; are  gaining greater importance to support label claims; have ethical  implications and directly impact regulatory decision making and thus,  eventually, evidence based practice.
