					Pharmaceutical  companies and doctors have an interdependent relationship throughout the world.  This relationship is even stronger in developing countries such as Sri Lanka,  and may lead to adverse outcomes especially for the consumer. Not only do drug  companies play a vital role in sponsoring continued professional development  (CPD) programmes, they are also at times 'nice enough' to grant personal favours  to their 'best prescribers'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors  who are frequently in contact with drug representatives are more willing to  prescribe newer drugs. Such doctors do not like ending consultations with  advice only, and are more likely to prescribe a drug that is not clinically  indicated <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Watkins C, Moore L, Harvey I, Carthy P, Robinson E, Brawn R. Characteristics of general practitioners who frequently see drug industry representatives: national cross sectional survey. BMJ 2003;326:1178-9." id="1">(1)</a>. The situation is worse in developing countries where doctors are  seen as 'Gods' by most patients who rarely question their doctors. Therefore,  the doctor may prescribe expensive drugs of their favourite pharmaceutical  company with scant regard for the expense borne by the patient. For instance,  the price of a 10 mg tablet of simvastatin ranges from Sri Lankan Rs 15 (US$  0.16) to Sri Lankan Rs 128 (US$1.35). Other reasons for doctors to prescribe  expensive brands is the presence of substandard drugs in the market <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jayasena K. Drugs-registration and marketing practices in the Third World. Development Dialogue 1985;2:38-47." id="2">(2)</a>. The  doctors' dilemma is: should they prescribe more expensive brands of reputed  companies of which the quality is assured, or low-priced brands of unknown  quality? However, strictly controlling drug sales by legislation may help in  addressing this problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  essential drug concept, introduced by the WHO to help developed countries  select appropriate drugs, also provides a basis for drug regulation. This  influenced the registration of pharmaceuticals in Sri Lanka <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Weerasuriya K. Essential drugs and registration of pharmaceuticals: the Sri Lankan experience. Bulletin of the World Health Organization 1993;71:229-35." id="3">(3)</a> but has no  control over the price of drugs. Moreover, writing generic prescriptions does  not prevent private retail pharmacies from dispensing higher-priced  alternatives for a bigger commission <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jayasinghe S, Jayasinghe S, de Silva P. State can make drugs available cheaply to poor people. BMJ 2003;326:553." id="4">(4)</a>. The market is poorly controlled and  has no ceiling for prices or the number of preparations (of the same drug) that  can be imported <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jayasinghe S, Jayasinghe S, de Silva P. State can make drugs available cheaply to poor people. BMJ 2003;326:553." id="4">(4)</a>. Prices can be controlled if the government-owned State  Pharmaceutical Corporation, which sells high-quality generic drugs at cheap  rates, opens up an island-wide network of retail outlets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  role that drug companies play is in 'educating' doctors. Continued professional  development is an essential component of a good healthcare system and will soon  be required for re-validation of doctors in Sri Lanka. However, such events, at  present, are unviable without sponsorship. Moreover, few doctors can afford to  attend international meetings at their own expenses. Therefore, doctors have no  alternative but to rely on the pharmaceutical trade to sponsor them. As the  drug companies aim to market their products, one will speculate on the validity  and quality of CPD programmes conducted solely by them, and the knowledge  doctors gain from such programmes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Codes  of ethics have been laid down by various organisations including the World  Medical Association <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wager E. How to dance with porcupines: rules and guidelines on doctors' relations with drug companies. BMJ 2003;326:1196-8." id="5">(5)</a> regarding the conduct of doctors with regard to their  relationship with pharmaceutical companies. However, such codes of ethics laid  down by local medical organisations are not available in Sri Lanka. Most  doctors may be unaware of the fact that drug companies influence their  prescribing behaviour. Although many have suggested that doctors should  distance themselves from drug companies, it is easier said than done in poor  countries such as Sri Lanka due to the reasons given above. What needs to be  done is to educate medical students about the marketing strategies of  pharmaceutical companies. Doctors should be encouraged to practice  evidence-based medicine rather than depend on the drug company's  representative. Lastly, professional associations should strive to generate  funds so that they can conduct their own CPD programmes. These programmes  should target non-postgraduates and those in remote outposts, as they are most  susceptible to the biased opinions of drug companies.
