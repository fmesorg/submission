				<h4>Need  for local research capacity</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The  following article persuasively points out why research relevant for India will  have to come from within.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Academic  professionals in developing countries work in isolation from primary care  settings. Most have to contend with an enormous load of teaching and clinical  care. There is little continuing medical education and even rarer access to  recent biomedical information, with the pharmaceutical industry filling the  gap. Salaries of academic professionals are insufficient to support a white-  collar lifestyle. Most of them resort to private practice. This further  encroaches on scarce time. Therefore, few are involved in developing and  testing public health interventions. Strengthening centres of learning and  creating local capacity for conducting and monitoring research are critical for  the promotion of academic medicine in developing countries.

				<h4>Consent  for tissue samples</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Most  Indians are unaware of the research and teaching value of tissue samples taken  during surgery. Therefore, a separate consent is not taken from Indian patients  for such use of their tissues. Yet it is important for the Indian medical  profession to be aware of the attitudes of the public. This issue will surface  in India sooner or later.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  authors interviewed 100 healthy volunteers to assess what types of tissue  individuals would be prepared to donate for research, what types of research  would be acceptable, whether parents would consent to the donation of a child's  tissues, and whether their tissues could be used for teaching. They discovered  that one in five would not agree to donate any tissue, perhaps reflecting  recent negative publicity surrounding post mortem organ retention and reports  of medical malpractice/criminal behaviour. Donation of some tissues such as the  eye and brain were unacceptable, while ovarian/testicular tissue was not,  perhaps because patients were familiar with egg and sperm donation for  fertility treatments. The majority agreed to donate in case of use for cancer  research but fewer agreed for research in genetic disorders or genetic cloning.  A majority favoured some ongoing control over tissues removed at surgery.  Although a detailed ethical review in 1995 concluded that a patient's consent  to the removal of tissue implied consent to its subsequent use for any  ethically acceptable purpose, this view is not universal. Educating the public  in the principles and practice of medical research may change this attitude.

				<h4>Need  for relevant research</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Research  is not an elite, academic endeavour that drains scarce resources from daily  clinical practice. Instead, it is essential for creating practical and relevant  health systems. That is the message of the following article describing the  WHO's plans for the next decade</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  November 2004, at an international summit organised by the WHO on health  research in Mexico, the overriding question will be what research is needed to  reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. This research must  return to the values of Alma Ata-WHO's 1978 commitment to primary health care.  All countries should have a health research system that drives health sector  reform. Research should be applied to improve health equity and must be  conducted according to universal ethical standards. The results of research  should be accessible to all. Civil society has a vital-and so far  neglected-part to play in setting research priorities.

				<h4>Research  on children</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Research  on children is essential to prevent harm as the following article states  persuasively.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Children  are a vulnerable group that needs protection from the potential harm of  participating in a drug study. Therefore, few drugs are tested in children; paediatric  prescribing largely involves educated guesses about doses, safety and  effectiveness. Lack of information either deprives children of the benefits of  drug therapy or exposes them to unknown side-effects. The most common  hindrances cited are ethical, technical and logistic. To rectify this, the US  has recently taken the lead in offering incentives for including children in  trials.

				<h4>Concordance  of patient and physician</h4>
				<p>
					<em>We  cannot always match patient and physician in a country as diverse as India.  Yet, the following article may help physicians who want to increase the level  of satisfaction among their patients. This is especially important when dealing  with disadvantaged groups.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					All  patients are sensitive to the affective climate of the medical encounter;  however, because of historical and personal experiences with discrimination,  African-American patients may be especially sensitive to interpersonal cues  from their physician that convey a message of caring, trustworthiness and  partnership. To study this, the authors audiotaped 252 primary care visits  monitoring whether communication was more patient- centred than  physician-centred. When both physician and patient were African-American or  both were white, the visit was about two minutes longer and the patient's  affect was more positive but, surprisingly, was not more patient-centred. This  positive affect may thus reflect factors such as mutual liking and respect, a  sense of social or racial group affiliation and enhanced trustworthiness or  positive expectations.

				<h4>Palliative  care for AIDS</h4>
				<p>
					<em>AIDS  has devastated Africa and some predict a similar fate for India. The bulk of  resources have been allocated for prevention as anti-retrovirals are still beyond  the reach of the average patient. The best that can be offered to an individual  with AIDS is death with dignity. India can learn and adapt the programme  described here.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Uganda  is the first and only African country that has made palliative care for people  in the terminal stages of AIDS and cancer a part of its national health plan.  Cheap, powdered morphine has been the keystone of Uganda's affordable, modern  palliative care movement, Hospice Uganda. The Ugandan government agreed to make  free morphine available when the Hospice was established, and modified statutes  to allow nurse specialists to prescribe morphine. The hospice had to overcome  fear and myths about morphine in the early years. Hospice training includes  lectures on practical and psychological factors in pain management and symptom  control, together with lectures on cultural beliefs and the use of local  remedies.

				<h4>The  medical maze</h4>
				<p>
					<em>All  patients, irrespective of economic class, find hospital stay bewildering and  frightening. The NHS in the UK has adopted some methods to make them less so.  Can we in India adopt their methods?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					When a  child develops a serious medical condition, parents are rapidly thrown into a  turmoil of shock and anxiety. Medical care can be messy, is often painful, and  the outcome may be uncertain. Parents may suddenly have to hand over the  responsibility for care of their children to staff they hardly know. Witnessing  the distress of one's sick child is one of the hardest situations for parents  to be in. They look at doctors and nurses as helpers and companions in the  fight against disease and death. Too often, however, we fail in these  compassionate roles. Some specialties such as transplantation surgery and  oncology have people who act as a link between the medical team and family, and  often guide a family through the medical system and beyond throughout the  patient's life. Many have a nursing background and have now become a patient's  and a family's advocate, giving practical and emotional support in and out of  hospital. The writer of this editorial describes the UK National Health  Service's Patient Advocacy and Liaison Service in each Trust hospital, which  employs on an average 2&middot;5 full-time staff per hospital who provide support,  education, and an open ear for any concerns.

				<h4>Direct  advertising</h4>
				<p>
					<em>We  are aware of the hazards of advertising of pharma-ceuticals but are not as  familiar with the hazards of aggressive advertising of preventive medical  services which include the latest in diagnostic tests. The following article  from Australia may be of relevance to us in India as well.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  growth in direct medical advertising of diagnostic tests, such as virtual  colonoscopy and heart scans, has occurred without being widely debated in the  community or within the profession. This is in stark contrast to the recent  vigorous debate on direct advertising of pharmaceuticals to consumers. Some  would say it is the consumer's right to choose and buy in a free market and  that medical advertising is adequately controlled by legislation, such as the  Trade Practices Act 1974, which prohibits misleading or deceptive advertising.  But medicine should be regulated by medical associations based on medical  principles and not by trade associations based on trade principles.

				<h4>Quality  of care</h4>
				<p>
					<em>We  tend to focus on the most sensational lapses of the health care system while  ignoring major issues such as access and distribution. The latter cause far  more preventable deaths. That is the message of the following article, which  has particular relevance for India as the health care industry begins to  emulate its counterparts in the West.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Safety  is an essential goal for health care. However, patients deserve far more than  not to be harmed by their physicians. Improving safety is vital, but it should  not distract from the larger mission of helping people maintain their health  and cope with illness, of which safety is only one component. The medical  profession should focus on this larger purpose and not on fragments.

				<h4>Doctored  admissions</h4>
				<p>
					<em>This  article, written in a wonderful anecdotal style, describes corruption in  medical entrance exams and the extent to which it is organised.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					In what  appears to be sound business tactics, the players practically guarantee the  student concerned marks good enough to ensure entrance into a medical  college-this by releasing most of the questions a few hours before the actual  examination. If something goes wrong and the questions leaked do not actually  appear in the question paper, not only is the&nbsp; money refunded (no  questions asked), but a 20% concession is offered at the next appearance. The  problem, as the writer points out, is that terms such as medical ethics will be  wasted on people who use unethical, illegal and devious routes to get into  medical colleges. Serving the poor will be the last thing on their minds as  they try to recover their investment and make a profit as well.

				<h4>Abuse  during childbirth</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Women  giving birth are particularly vulnerable to abuse by health care personnel, and  perhaps more so in public hospitals. This qualitative investigation documents  factors facilitating violation of women's reproductive rights during childbirth  in Mexico. It is based on approximately 200 testimonies, and formal and 64  systematic direct observations in birth and labour rooms in two large public  hospitals. The issues raised here are definitely applicable to India.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Three  patterns of behaviour during childbirth are identified, which result in  violation of women's reproductive rights. Health care personnel use their  positions of power and control to intimidate women. The report documents the  use of coercion, threats and physical punishment to obtain consent for the  insertion of contraceptive devices. Women unaccustomed to defending their  rights accept the role they are forced into as hospital patients. And public  health institutions discourage women from pursuing formal complaints.
