				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>
					In mid-2009, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine  "demonstration projects" were conducted by the Program for Appropriate  Technology in Health (PATH), a Seattle-based non-governmental organisation, in  collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state  governments of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. The projects were funded by the Bill  and Melinda Gates Foundation. The vaccines used, Gardasil and Cervarix, were  donated to PATH by the manufacturing companies; in this case, GlaxoSmithKline  and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD). These HPV vaccines were administered to  approximately 23,000 young girls, of between 10 and 14 years of age, in the  district of Khammam in Andhra Pradesh, and in the district of Vadodara in  Gujarat.
				</p>
				<p>
					These projects were  suspended by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) in 2010,  following the deaths of seven tribal girls and strong opposition from civil  society groups to the unethical design and conduct of the projects. An inquiry  committee was constituted to look into the "alleged irregularities" in the  conduct of the projects. The committee's report <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Final Report of the Committee appointed by the Government of India (vide notification No. V 25011/160/2010 &ndash;HR dated April 15, 2010) to enquire into Alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India. New Delhi: GoI; 2011 Feb 15." id="1">(1)</a> agreed with the contention  that there had been several violations of the rights of the participants and of  regulatory procedures, but failed to apportion blame. It also remained silent  on the recommendation that those involved in permitting and conducting such a  trial should be punished. Despite evidence of clear violations, the inquiry  absolved all involved in the project of any responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Taking a serious view of the procedural and ethical lapses in  the projects, the 72nd Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family  Welfare recently carried out an enquiry into the studies and presented its  report on "Alleged Irregularities in the Conduct of Studies using Human  Papilloma Virus (HPV) Vaccine" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				<h4>Undoubtedly a clinical trial</h4>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report clearly states that the "demonstration  project", as it was repeatedly referred to by PATH, was a clinical trial,  regardless of what PATH called it <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare. Seventy second report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India.

Available from: http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Health%20and%20Family%20Welfare/72.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. The report takes note of the  observations of the MoHFW's enquiry committee that, "the demonstration project  is a study of a pharmaceutical product carried out on humans and since the  primary objectives include the study of serious adverse events, it is clear  that clinical trial rules and guidelines should apply" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				</p>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report further states that by  carrying out the clinical trial in the guise of an "observation/demonstration  project," PATH has violated all the laws and regulations laid down for clinical  trials by the Government of India <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				<h4>Dereliction of duty and other serious concerns</h4>
				<p>
					Unlike the report of the MoHFW's enquiry committee <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Final Report of the Committee appointed by the Government of India (vide notification No. V 25011/160/2010 &ndash;HR dated April 15, 2010) to enquire into Alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India. New Delhi: GoI; 2011 Feb 15." id="1">(1)</a>,  however, the 72nd Report points to  serious dereliction of duty on the part of many of the institutions and  organisations that were involved <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare. Seventy second report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India.

				</p>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report questions the role of the ICMR, the apex body  in the country for health research and the formulation of guidelines on  clinical trial ethics, which was a complicit participant and collaborator in  this project <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare. Seventy second report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India.

The 72nd Report states that the ICMR Project Advisory Group  (PAG) representative and some of the council's officials acted as partisans of  PATH and in the interest of the manufacturing companies, rather than as  representatives of an institution mandated to maintain as well as ensure the  implementation of the highest ethical standards in research <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				</p>
				<p>
					The 72ndReport also mentions that one of the roles assigned  to the ICMR as per the memorandum of agreement (MOU) signed by the Director-General  of the council is "advising on plans for results dissemination to support  decision-making for use of the HPV vaccine." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

Available from: http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Health%20and%20Family%20Welfare/72.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. The Report expresses its  inability to "understand as to how ICMR could commit itself to support the use  of the HPV vaccines in an MOU signed in 2007, even before the vaccine was  approved for use in the country." It also wonders "how the ICMR could commit  itself to promote the drug for inclusion in the Universal Immunisation  Programme (UIP) even before any independent study about its utility and  rationale for inclusion in the UIP was undertaken" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

					The Standing Committee's  inquiry has proved that the DCGI played a very questionable role in the entire  matter. According to the 72nd Report, the DCGI "remained a silent spectator  even when its own rules and regulations were being so flagrantly violated." The  report further states: "The approvals of the clinical trials, marketing  approvals and import licences by the DCGI appear irregular" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				</p>
				<p>
					The Standing Committee has firmly  rebuked the Department of Health Research under the MoHFW. According to the  72nd Report, "the whole issue has been diluted and no accountability has been  fixed on the erring officials/department for gross violations committed in the  conduct of the study." The committee also felt that a very casual approach had  been taken by the department in the matter and that its response reflects the  lack of any concrete action to protect and safeguard the health of our people <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare. Seventy second report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India.

				</p>

				<p>
					Questioning the role played by PATH, the Standing Committee  report states, <em>"It is apparent that PATH has exploited with impunity the  loopholes in our system, as also the absence of a nodal point or a single  window for maintaining a data bank of foreign entities entering the country for  setting up their offices" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

It goes on to say, "...it is established that  PATH, by carrying out the clinical trials for HPV vaccines in Andhra Pradesh  and Gujarat under the pretext of an observation/demonstration project, has  violated all laws and regulations laid down for clinical trials by the  government. While doing so, its sole aim has been to promote the commercial  interests of HPV vaccine manufacturers who would have reaped windfall profits  had PATH been successful in getting the HPV vaccine included in the UIP of the  country" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				</p>
				<p>
					The Standing Committee  takes a serious view of the violations and strongly recommends that on the  basis of the facts, PATH should be made accountable and the MoHFW should initiate appropriate action in the  matter. This should include legal action for the breach of various laws of the  land and possible violation of the laws of the country of PATH's origin (2:p30; pp 42&ndash;43).

				<h4>Conflict of interest</h4>
				<p>
					The Standing Committee  sought information from the MoHFW as to whether the members of the inquiry  committee were asked to file a conflict of interest declaration. According to  the 72nd Report, MSD was sponsoring and funding a trial in the All India  Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), in the department to which a member of  the inquiry committee belonged <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

The Standing Committee has  strongly deprecated the government's action in "appointing the committee to  inquire into such a serious matter in such a casual manner even without  ascertaining as to whether any of the members of the said inquiry committee  have any conflict of interest with the subject matter of the inquiry" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

					The 72nd Report states: "The  ministry appointed a senior official of ICMR (described as resource person) to  assist the inquiry committee. The concerned individual was the main link  between ICMR and PATH, and had participated actively in all discussions and  meetings and helped PATH to carry out the project proactively in every respect  right from the beginning in October 2006. As such, he had a clear conflict of  interest and could not be relied upon to give correct information and unbiased  opinions. Indeed, he should have been summoned as a witness to answer questions  and not as an official resource person attached to the enquiry committee" <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				<h4>Flaws in "project" design, consent  process</h4>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report expresses its disapproval of the "project"  design, which resulted in gross under-reporting of adverse events, and  questions the figures for the reported non-serious adverse events <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare. Seventy second report on alleged irregularities in the conduct of studies using Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine by PATH in India.

Available from: http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Health%20and%20Family%20Welfare/72.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>. It is  also critical of the lack of independent systems and rigorous monitoring and  management of adverse events/serious adverse events (AE/SAE).
				</p>
				<p>
					On the issue of consent, the 72nd Report observes that there  were gross violations of the concept of consent and the legal requirement for  it <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

This is evident from the "incomplete and inaccurate" consent forms, the  failure to give comprehensive information to the participants'  parents/guardians on various aspects of the vaccination, direction by the state  (Andhra Pradesh) to hostel wardens to sign the consent forms on behalf of the  parents/guardians, among other things. Another serious gap mentioned by the  72nd Report is the absence of insurance cover for the girls <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

				<h4>Funding of the trial: grey areas</h4>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report notes the  observations made by the inquiry committee at its meeting on September 27, 2010  (Appendix 20.5):
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						....The study was initiated by PATH on its  own ... without any reference from the National Technical Advisory Group on  Immunisation (NTAGI), the official body of the GOI on vaccines.... It is not  clear whether the state expenses were funded by PATH or came from their own  resources. The monetary contributions of ICMR are also not clear. The  Committee, therefore, felt that it would be in the fitness of the inquiry to  document the sources and magnitude of funding of the study <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					However, the committee's report did  not delve into the matter. No mention was made of the funding from the Bill  and Melinda Gates Foundation and other sources, or  of the money spent by the ICMR and state governments.

				<h4>Human rights violations</h4>
				<p>
					The 72nd Report states that what  PATH did is a clear-cut violation of the human rights of girl children and  adolescents, and is a serious breach of medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

It recommends that every effort should be made to expedite the  preparation of a report that brings to light the real facts about the HPV  vaccine trial, and to ensure that corrective measures, both in connection with  the HPV trial as well as all such ongoing or proposed clinical trials of  drugs/vaccines are implemented.

Available from: http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/EnglishCommittees/Committee%20on%20Health%20and%20Family%20Welfare/72.pdf" id="2">(2)</a> validates the campaign led by civil  society that has highlighted the violations committed in the HPV trials and has  been demanding action ever since deaths were reported in 2010.&nbsp;We hope  that the government and agencies concerned will act on the Standing Committee's  findings expeditiously. We are living in a world in which scientific and  technological advances are being made at a rapid pace and hold great promise;  indeed, clinical trials are necessary if safe and effective medicines are to be  developed. However, we cannot allow the pharmaceutical industry to go further  in the direction in which it seems to be headed today, ie where medical ethics,  rules and human rights are sacrificed at the altar of profiteering.
