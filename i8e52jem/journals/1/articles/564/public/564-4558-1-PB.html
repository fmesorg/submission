				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The informed consent process is a shield which protects subjects  from harms that may be caused by a  scientific enquiry. Only a competent participant with a complete understanding  of the trial can give informed consent. Although the content of a valid  informed consent form (ICF) has been established, the Drugs and Cosmetics  (First Amendment) Rules, 2013 have stipulated that ICFs must fulfil the  requirements of Appendix V of Schedule Y. We considered 50 ICFs and analysed whether they complied with Appendix  V. Our analysis reveals a gloomy picture, with 70% of the ICFs deviating from  the requirements of the law. We have identified the elements most commonly  overlooked in the ICFs analysed. We recommend certain points which must be  incorporated into ICFs to help participants better understand the trial. Our  findings indicate that adequate action needs to be taken to ensure the  protection of the rights of research participants.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					The informed consent process is the practical application of the principle of autonomy <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Osman H. History and development of the doctrine of informed consent. Int Electron J Health Educ. 2001;4:41-7." id="1">(1)</a>.  Informed consent that is given freely is central to ethically sound research. This practical application of autonomy ensures that in no instance are there elements of coercion, deceit or abuse. Informed consent must be obtained in the right manner from participants in research and patients in clinical care <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gelling L, Bishop V, Fitzgerald M, Johnson M, Kenkre J, Greenhalgh T, Haigh C, Read S, Watson R. Informed consent in healthcare and social care research, RCN guidance for nurses. 2nd ed. London: Royal College of Nursing; 2011." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Informed consent is essential for upholding the patient's
					autonomy, safeguarding individual rights and promoting
					ethical research. It aims at helping potential participants who
					have been deemed suitable for recruitment in a particular
					study to reach a decision on whether or not to participate.
					Obtaining informed consent is not a one-time procedure
					limited to the time of the recruitment of the participant. The
					process must be a continuous one that lasts till the end of the
					study. The three cornerstones of an ethical and valid informed
					consent process are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						effective communication,
					</li>
					<li>
						full information, and
					</li>
					<li>
						freely given consent <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Education, Special Education (GSE) New Zealand. Informed consent guidelines [Internet]. 2006[cited 2013 Sep 9]. Available from: http://www.minedu.govt.nz/~/media/MinEdu/Files/EducationSectors/SpecialEducation/FormsGuidelines/InformedConsentGuidelines.pdf" id="3">(3)</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					For the informed consent process to be completely effective in protecting the patient's rights, the patient must take a decision based on complete comprehension and voluntariness.
				</p>

				<p>
					The concept of making informed consent in research and clinical practice mandatory is based on the principle of "respect for the patient". However, there are several challenges that impede the smooth implementation of obtaining effective informed consent. One of the obstacles has its roots in the phrase itself - the first component, 'information', comes from the principal investigator, while the other, "consent", comes from the participant. The patient-doctor relationship is fraught with many problems, including the paternalistic behaviour of doctors, as well as inadequate communication and lack of comprehension <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wood SY, Freidland BA, McGrory CE. Informed consent: from good intentions to sound practices. Proceeding of the Population Council; 2001; New York: The Population Council Inc.; 2002." id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ambrosius Macrobius once said, "Good laws have their origin
					in bad morals." Indeed, a long history of abuse, deceit and
					lack of moral fibre gave birth to the practice of informed
					consent. The earliest documented reference to the concept of
					informed consent dates back to the nineteenth century, and
					precedes the Nuremberg Code. The Prussian government's
					ministry for religious, educational and medical affairs issued
					a directive which mandated that people could be enrolled in
					non-therapeutic research only after they had been given an
					explanation regarding the risks they might face, and after they
					consented to enrol. The directive also emphasised written
					documentation and held the medical director responsible
					for ensuring the ethical conduct of research <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vollmann J, Winau R. Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg Code. BMJ. 1996;313:1445-7." id="5">(5)</a>. The first ever
					documented use of an informed consent form was the one
					introduced by Major Walter Reed (of the US army) during his
					experiments on the transmission of yellow fever. He went to
					great lengths to ensure that the subjects were fully aware of
					the risks involved, even translating the consent documents into
					Spanish for the benefit of Cuban volunteers <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yellowfever.lib.virginia.edu [Internet]. University of Virginia Health Sciences Library, Historical Division. Yellow Fever Commission [cited 2013 Sep 9]. Available from: http://yellowfever.lib.virginia.edu/reed/commission.html" id="6">(6)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the concept of informed consent became more
					structured in the Nuremberg Code <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Trial of War Criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council Law No 10. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office;1949;10(2):181-2." id="7">(7)</a>, it was never universally
					accepted and instances of unethical research mushroomed.
					Stringent action became necessary to curb this trend. Among
					the efforts to ensure that research involving human subjects
					should be ethical was the formulation of guidelines for ICFs
					in The Declaration of Helsinki <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects [Internet]. Last revised 2008 Oct [cited 2013 Sep 13]. Helsinki, Finland: WMA General Assembly;1964, Available from: http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/17c.pdf" id="8">(8)</a>. These were adopted by the
					World Medical Association in 1964. The declaration provides
					guidelines to formulate an informed consent document and
					conduct the informed consent process.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Informed consent is deemed necessary for most types of
					experimentation on humans, but may not be so in the case
					of some experiments. Experiments on humans in the field of
					behavioural studies might not require the informed consent
					of the participants; on the contrary, providing information
					for consent might defeat the purpose of the investigation. In
					these trials, the participants'' interest is best served if they are
					not given any information about the trial, that is if the trial
					does not pose any physical or mental risk to the patient. For example, a worker's response to a fire drill can be best studied if
					information on the experiment is withheld from the worker. The
					US Code of Federal Regulations <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Code of Federal Regulation. 45 C.F.R 46.116. Available from: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.116" id="9">(9)</a> has laid down the following
					conditions under which the informed consent process can be
					waived.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.
					</li>
					<li>
						The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is not practicable to carry out the research without the waiver or alteration.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					It is also specified that whenever appropriate, the subjects
					will be provided with additional relevant information after
					participation. This process is often referred to as "debriefing."
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,
					introduced in 1988, set forth regulatory guidelines for the
					launch of new drugs. It was amended in January 2005 to bring
					about harmonisation between the Indian guidelines and the
					guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation
					of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals
					for Human Use (ICH). Schedule Y recommended formats for
					critical documents used in clinical research, one of which is
					the ICF <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatt A. Evolution of clinical research: A history beyond James Lind. Perspect Clin Res. 2010;1(1):6-10." id="10">(10)</a>. The mandatory provisions regarding the contents
					of ICFs are provided in Appendix V of the Schedule. Thus, it is
					legally binding for the ICFs of trials conducted in India to be
					in accordance with Appendix V. The Drugs and Cosmetics
					(First Amendment) Rules, 2013, in sub-paragraph 3(ii) under
					the section on Responsibilities of the Investigator(s), specify:
					"The investigator will provide information to the clinical trial
					subject through the informed consent process as provided
					in the Appendix V about the essential elements of the clinical
					trial and the subject's right to claim compensation in case of
					trial-related injury or death." Thus, the law requires every ICF to
					contain the elements of Appendix V.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this article, we have attempted to check whether the
					format of a sample of ICFs is in agreement with Appendix V
					of Schedule Y. This has been accomplished by investigating
					whether the contents of the selected ICFs contain all the
					mandatory elements specified in the Schedule Y. Schedule Y
					requires each ICF to incorporate 19 essential elements in their
					entirety. We have compared the contents of the ICFs with the
					mandatory elements quite strictly.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Materials and methods</h4>
				<p>
					We collected 50 ICFs which were used for trials conducted
					between 2008 and 2013. These ICFs were collected from a site
					for clinical trials that was located in a tertiary care centre in
					Pune. The ICFs were the 50 most recent and consecutive ICFs
					approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All the 50 ICFs
					considered were for drug trials and only the English versions
					were analysed for the study. Due permission was obtained
					from the hospital authorities and the IRB to analyse the ICFs. An
					attempt was made to check whether the contents of the ICFs were in accordance with the 19 mandatory elements specified
					under Schedule Y <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Drugs and Cosmetics (II nd Amendment) Rules 2005: Schedule Y, Appendix V.

					<li>
						Description  of any reasonable foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject
					</li>
					<li>
						Description  of any benefits to the subject or others reasonably expected from the research.  If no benefit is expected, the subject should be made aware of this
					</li>
					<li>
						Disclosure  of specific appropriate, alternative procedures or therapies available to the  subject
					</li>
					<li>
						Statement  describing the extent to which confidentiality of the records identifying the  subject will be maintained and who will have access to the subject's medical  records

					<li>
						Trial  treatment schedule(s) and the probability for [sic] random assignment to each  treatment (for randomized trials)

					</li>
					<li>
						Statement  that the subject will be notified in a timely manner if significant new  findings develop during the course of the research which may affect the subject's  willingness to continue participation will be provided
					</li>
					<li>
						A  statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the  subject (or to the embryo or foetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant),  which are currently unforeseeable.

					<li>
						Approximate  number of subjects enrolled in the study.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We examined the ICFs not only for their content and the
					presence and completeness of these mandatory elements,
					but also for the language, writing style and presentation of
					information. We identified certain key words in statements related to the mandatory elements. When these key words/
					phrases were absent, the elements were considered to be
					"present but incomplete." Certain elements had been omitted
					altogether from the ICFs. In this case, the elements were
					regarded as "not present." Only an element which was present
					and complete with the key words/phrases was regarded as
					"present in its entirety." Let us take the example of the element:
					"Statement that participation is voluntary, that the subject
					can withdraw from the study at any time and that refusal to
					participate will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to
					which the subject is otherwise entitled." If the word "voluntary"
					or the phrase "penalty or loss of benefits" is missing, we have
					termed it "present but incomplete." All the elements in the
					ICFs were grouped under the three categories mentioned
					above. Each instance of an element was recorded as a 'count'. It
					was recorded if it was missing but required, as well as if it was
					present but not required.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results and discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Of the 50 ICFs analysed, only 30% adhered to the norms
					specified in Appendix V of Schedule Y on the content to be
					included in an ICF (Figure 1).
				</p>
				<p>
					We identified a total of 950 counts of mandatory elements
					in the 50 ICFs analysed by us. Out of these, 873 counts were
					present in their entirety, in 63 counts; the element was either
					absent or incomplete. Among these 63, 37 were "present but
					incomplete" and 26 were "not present" (Figure 2). In 14 counts,
					the element was not applicable to the particular trial. Seventy
					per cent of the ICFs were found not to be in accordance with
					Schedule Y. These had collectively 63 absent or incomplete
					mandatory elements with a mean of 1.8 counts of incomplete
					and/or absent mandatory elements per ICF.
				</p>
				<p>
					About 30% of the ICFs analysed lacked information on the
					alternative therapies available to the patient, besides the
					investigational product. The percentage of ICFs which had not
					followed this particular norm either said "alternative therapies
					are available" or contained no statement on the matter at
					all; there was no disclosure of information on the alternative
					therapies available to the participant. This implies that the
					options provided by the ICFs regarding treatment were biased towards the product being investigated. Although it must be
					noted that the ICFs asked the patients to discuss alternative
					treatments with their study doctor, Schedule Y clearly
					mentions the need to "disclose specific appropriate alternative
					procedures or therapies available to the subject."

						Figure 2: Classification of mandatory elements of analysed ICFs
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					About 26% of the ICFs analysed did not contain a "statement
					that participation is voluntary, the subject can withdraw
					from the study at any time and that refusal to participate
					will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to which the
					subject is otherwise entitled." ICFs which did not contain
					key words/phrases such as "voluntary" and "will not involve
					any penalty or loss of benefits" were deemed to have
					incomplete or partial information on the said mandatory
					element. This is an important statement which emphasises
					the participant's freedom of expression and action. It ensures
					that the participants cannot be coerced or blackmailed into
					participating and continuing to participate in the trial against
					their will. The participants are free to decide whether they want
					to participate or continue participating in the trial without
					fearing any repercussions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the ICFs analysed, 14% did not contain a "statement that the
					subject---- will be notified in a timely manner if significant new
					findings develop during the course of the research which may
					affect the subject's willingness to continue participation." In the
					course of a research study, there are often instances when new
					information is made available to the investigator from other
					investigational sites. This information must be passed down
					to the research participant by the site investigator to keep the
					process of informed consent active. The new information might
					affect the individual's decision to continue participation in the
					trial. Thus, such information must be given to the participants
					in a timely manner. The absence of this element increases the
					burden of risk on participants and keeps them in the dark
					about the potential peril that may await them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Around 10% of the ICFs analysed lacked information on the
					expected duration of the patient's participation. If the ICF does not furnish information on the approximate time for which the
					participant is to be involved in the trial, there is a possibility
					that the participant will face exploitation due to the whims
					of the study doctor or the sponsor. A patient might end up
					participating in the trial for much longer than required and the
					repercussions may be similar to those in the Tuskegee trial <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cobb WM. The Tuskegee syphilis study. J Natl Med Assoc. 1973; 65(4): 345-8." id="12">(12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Around 8% of the ICFs analysed did not contain the following.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>Description of any benefits to the subject or others reasonably
						expected from research.</em> This information gives a clear picture
						of the therapeutic gain that participation in the trial may
						bring and assures the participant that he/she is not merely
						a pawn in a scientific endeavour.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Statement of foreseeable circumstances under which the
						subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator
						without the subject's consent.</em> In cases in which the
						principal investigator feels that the patient would do
						better with alternative therapy or the patient's condition
						is deteriorating, the principal investigator can terminate
						the patient's participation in the trial without the latter's
						consent. When the participant does not abide by the
						instructions of the study staff, the principal investigator
						may be forced to expel the subject from the trial without
						the latter's consent.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>A statement that the particular treatment or procedure may
						involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or foetus, if the
						subject is or may become pregnant), which are currently
						unforeseeable.</em> This statement categorically specifies
						that pregnant and lactating women should not expose
						themselves to the product being investigated as it can have
						a damaging effect on the foetus. Women who are taking
						part in the trial and who may get pregnant and men whose
						partners can get pregnant must practice safe sex to avoid
						pregnancy. This would safeguard the unborn from the effect
						of the product under investigation. This statement is aimed
						at averting a tragedy such as the thalidomide disaster <a class="reference" href="#thirteeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="L&eacute;cutier MA. Phocomelia and internal defects due to Thalidomide. Br Med J. 1962 Dec 1; 2(5317): 1447-8." id="13">(13)</a>.
					</li>
              </ul>
			  <p>
						About 6% of the ICFs analysed did not contain information
						on<em> the approximate number of subjects enrolled in the
						study.</em> Specifying the number of patients taking part in the
						experimental treatment might help to instil confidence in the
						subjects, as having an idea of the sheer number of participants
						may be a source of reassurance to them.</p>
                        <p>Approximately 4% of the ICFs analysed did not contain the following.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						The consequences of participants' withdrawal from the
						trial and the procedures for orderly termination of their
						participation. This must be explained in the ICF so that
						the participant can withdraw voluntarily, with no fear and
						reservations regarding medical care, penalties or deterrents.
						The procedures for orderly termination of the participation
						must be explained in the interest of the safety of the
						participant.
				  </li>
					<li>
						The additional costs to the subject that may result from
						participation in the study were not mentioned. A mention
						of any additional costs is particularly important in the case of add-on studies, i.e. when the trial is conducted to check
						the efficacy and safety of add-on therapy and not the main
						therapy. Clear instructions stating whether the patient
						must pay/not pay for the main therapy would avoid any
						confusion.
					</li>
			  </ul>
				<p>
					A small percentage (around 2%) of the ICFs analysed lacked the
					following information.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						These ICFs did not contain information on the <em>compensation
						and/or treatment(s) available to the subject in the event of
						a trial-related injury.</em> This is a point which is of the utmost
						importance, particularly in the light of the recent discussions
						on the compensation given to participants for trial-related
						injury <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Appendix XII, Drugs and Cosmetics (First Amendment) Rules, 2013. The Gazette of India, Part II- Section 3-Sub-section (i) (January 30th, 2013)" id="14">(14)</a>. The grounds on which compensation should be
						given to the participant must be elucidated clearly. In case
						of trial-related injury, detailed information on the treatment
						of the injury should be supplied. If this information is not
						duly provided, the matter would have to be resolved in a
						court of law.
					</li>
					<li>
						There was no information on the <em>anticipated prorated
						payment, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial.</em> This
						section deals with the possibility of the participant being
						paid to participate in the trial. The provision of incentives
						to the participant to take part in a trial is a matter of
						controversy as this might lead to unethical exploitation of
						the participant.
					</li>
					<li>
						These ICFs did not contain an <em>explanation about who to
						contact for trial-related queries and in the event of an injury,
						or for an explanation about their rights.</em> In the course of a
						trial, certain doubts may arise, the participant may want
						more information or medical help, or may have other
						grievances which need to be addressed. For these reasons,
						the contact information of the principal investigator and
						representative of the ethics committee must be provided to
						the participants. It is important to offer participants a line of
						communication so that their grievances can be addressed.
					</li>
					<li>
						These forms lacked information on the <em>subject's
						responsibility in the trial.</em> This is a vital aspect of trials which
						reflects that the participants are an integral part of the
						trial and must help it function smoothly. They can do so
						by following the directions given in the ICF about their
						responsibility and the instructions given by the study staff.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					However, all the ICFs analysed did contain the following
					elements.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>A statement that the study involves research and an
						explanation of the purpose of the research.</em> This statement
						emphasizes that the proposed therapy is not being
						practised currently and research must be conducted to
						prove the proposed therapy's efficacy. The ICF must contain
						a brief explanation of the aim of the research.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Information on the trial's treatment schedule(s) and the
						probability of random assignment to each treatment (for
						randomised trials).</em> This section pertains to when, how and
						what medications will be administered to the participant
						during the trial. In the case of randomised trials, information on how each participant would be placed in the treatment
						arms is to be explained. The failure to explain these
						matters would leave participants in the dark about what
						medications to take, as well as when and how to take them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or
						discomforts to the subject.</em> This information specifies
						the possible demerits of the trial that could affect the
						participant adversely. They must be made aware of these
						risks before their consent is taken.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>A statement describing the extent to which the confidentiality
						of records identifying the subject will be maintained and
						who will have access to the subject's medical records.</em> This
						statement ensures that the participants' identity remains
						confidential during their participation in the trial. It also
						clarifies who would have access to this confidential
						information and the reason for which this access is granted
						to them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>A description of the procedures to be followed, including all
						invasive procedures.</em> This section provides information on
						all the tests and medical procedures which the participants
						must endure during the course of the trial. If this
						information is not provided, they will have no knowledge
						of the tests that they will be put through and the necessity
						of the tests. Such a situation may be exploited, to conduct
						tests and procedures that are not sanctioned, for the sake
						of medical inquisitiveness.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Our analysis has led us to believe that instituting some changes
					will increase the transparency of trials and build the patient's
					trust in a system that is essentially alien to most. The following
					suggestions should be considered for inclusion in every ICF.
					Some of these changes were observed in less than 8% of the
					ICFs analysed.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<em>The details of the insurance provider, the total cover and the
						conditions of claim should be made clear.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						We believe it is most unfortunate that the participant has
						no information on the insurance policy taken out on him/
						her by the sponsor. There is no information on what the
						clauses are, the grounds on which the participant would
						be given compensation, when the participant can claim compensation, and when it is not permissible to seek
						compensation. These unresolved issues would prove to
						be a hurdle when seeking compensation for trial-related
						injuries. We suggest that the participant should be given a
						copy of the insurance policy (or an abstract) along with the
						ICF, and be made cognizant of the terms and conditions of
						the insurance policy before giving consent.

						</div>
					</div>
					<li>
						<em>Information should be provided on what to do when the
						participants miss their medication or visit.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						Participants might sometimes forget to take their
						medications and/or miss a scheduled study visit. In such
						situations, information on "what is to be done next," ie
						when and how to take the next round of medication, could
						prove to be of vital importance. Missed study visits must be
						communicated to the study staff immediately and remedial
						measures taken.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>The participant should be informed whether any offsite
						services are offered by the site staff.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						There may be times when the participant, for personal
						or professional reasons, cannot make the scheduled visit
						to the study site. It should be made known whether, in
						such cases, the study site would offer to collect biological
						material, such as blood, and information, such as knowledge
						attitude questionnaire, from the participant's place of
						choice. These are called offsite services, for which the
						participant's consent must be obtained in order to protect
						his/her privacy.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>The participants must be given clear information on the
						amount of time (hours) they are expected to spend on study
						visits every week or month.</em>
						<p>
							When enrolling participants in a trial, the site staff must
							check whether they have time to spare from their regular
							schedules for activities related to the study so as to ensure
							the best possible compliance. Good compliance might
							increase the likelihood of the drug under study being as
							efficacious and safe as possible. Thus, if time is an important
							factor, the participant will find it easier to take a decision on
							whether or not to participate in the trial if he/she is given
							information on the amount of time (hours) that might have
							to be spent per week /month on study-related activities.
							The provision of this information would lead to better
							compliance, which would be good both for the study and
							participants.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>The ICF should contain a statement which makes it clear
						that participants in the trial can avail of legal assistance and
						which informs them that signing the ICF is not tantamount to
						surrendering their legal rights.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						Although these ideas may seem obvious to the trial staff
						and those involved in clinical research, such a statement
						will serve as a useful reminder to the participants of their
						rights, since they may not be familiar with the functioning
						of a clinical trial. This statement may give the participants
						courage to seek legal help if they feel that they have been
						wronged in any way during the trial. This right is available
						to them even after signing the ICF.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>The participant should be provided with information on the
						regulatory status of the drug under study in other countries.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						Information on the status of the drug the world over,
						including details regarding its presence in the market,
						efficacy and safety, will help participants assess the benefit
						of the drug under investigation. Information on whether
						the drug is available as an over-the-counter drug, only by
						prescription, or only in hospitals, will help them gain an
						understanding of the drug.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>There should be a statement reassuring participants that the
						trial has been approved by the regulatory authority and the
						IRB/IEC.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						When lay persons come across an ICF, they are overwhelmed
						by the quantity of scientific literature and information on
						the disease itself. An assurance in the form of a statement
						that the regulatory authorities have examined the trial and
						certified it as safe for participants is of great help.
					</p>

					<li>
						<em>The ICF should contain a statement that the profits accruing
						from the trial are not intended to be shared with the trial
						participants.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						If a company has designed any product with the help of the
						participants' biological samples and is not willing to share
						the profits with them, this decision must be stated in the
						ICF. It should be clarified that there are no profit-sharing
						models in place for the products developed.
					</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The Drugs and Cosmetics (First Amendment) Rules have made
					the elements of Appendix V of Schedule Y mandatory for every
					ICF used in trials in India. We fear that there is a long way to go
					before ICFs become compliant with the provisions of Appendix
					V. In our small analysis, a meagre 30% of the total ICFs analysed
					were in agreement with the norms of Schedule Y. More than
					three-fourths were not in accordance with the regulatory
					norms of the country. Among the 63 counts of deviation
					from the elements mandated in Schedule Y, 37 fell under the
					category of "incomplete", which signifies partial information
					and even the absence of key words/phrases mandated in the
					statements. About 26 deviations related to the omission of
					the elements required. In 14 instances, a few of the mandatory
					elements included were not applicable to the particular trial.
					For example, a statement that the particular treatment or
					procedure may involve currently unforeseeable risks to the
					participant (or to the embryo or foetus, if the participant is or
					may become pregnant) does not apply in observational trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some ICFs, the information was presented in a disorganised
					manner. Some were written very eloquently, though it is
					doubtful how far a person with an average command of English
					and medicine would be able to grasp the contents of such an
					ICF. It must be noted that some ICFs met every requirement
					of the Schedule Y guidelines. However, the language and style of writing would, in our opinion, make it difficult for the
					average Indian patient to comprehend the information and
					connect with the trial. We have suggested certain elements
					which, when incorporated, could help the patient gain a better
					understanding of the issues involved.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is worth noting that, even as the ethical and regulatory issues
					pertaining to clinical trials are being made more stringent, ICFs
					continue to be incomplete or misinformed. Most of these ICFs
					belonged to trials conducted between 2008 and 2013. The
					observations which have been made here reflect trends; an
					analysis of 50 ICFs may not amount to statistically significant
					findings. In any case, the analysis presents a grim picture and
					the matter is worth pursuing further. We would also like to
					suggest that trials must be approved by the ethics committee
					only when their ICFs contain all the mandatory elements
					mentioned in Schedule Y.
