				<h4>Counselling for  thalassaemia</h4>
				<p>
					This audit of the  counselling process for couples in the UK whose pregnancies were affected by a  major thalassaemia sought to measure how and when genetic risk was identified  for each couple, and whether and when prenatal diagnosis was offered. The  findings: standard practice of prenatal screening and counselling for  haemoglobin disorders was not followed in a large proportion of the couples  interviewed, resulting in a number of couples giving birth to a child with  thalassaemia major. If they had been offered prenatal diagnosis, some of these  couples would have terminated their pregnancies. Although antenatal screening  and counselling for haemoglobin disorders are standard practices in the United  Kingdom, they are delivered inadequately and inequitably. An explicit national  policy is needed, to make early prenatal diagnosis available to all couples.

				<h4>Screening for cystic fibrosis</h4>
				<p>
					Practical methods are  now available for population screening of neonates for cystic fibrosis. Though  the prognosis for the disease has not yet improved with diagnosis and treatment  from birth, this is expected to happen eventually. The authors discuss ethical  reasons in support of neonatal diagnosis and early treatment.

				<h4>When to stop a trial</h4>
				<p>
					The research process  includes a thorough evaluation of existing evidence along with a meta-analysis  of earlier studies to confirm the need for the research project. Once started,  a randomised clinical trial can come to a halt for a number of reasons. The authors  describe their experience stopping a large international trial because of  external evidence that emerged after the trial began.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trial evaluated the antenatal use of thyrotropin releasing hormone combined  with corticosteroids in women at risk of preterm labour. Researchers had  reviewed earlier trials and were also aware of other ongoing trials. After  recruitment started, one of the investigators peer-reviewed a journal  submission on one of the other trials, which indicated that the drug affected  babies' developmental scores, and the results of two other trials were also  found to be disappointing. An updated meta-analysis suggested the hormone  would have little benefit, if at all; even confirming this would require a much  larger sample size than planned.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the basis of their experiences, the authors suggest that principal  investigators of clinical trials follow relevant information from other  studies, including unpublished confidential information. Meta-analysis is  useful for incorporating ongoing trial data with existing and emerging  evidence. Finally, a data monitoring committee must review internal and  external information, but the decision to modify or stop a trial must come from  a separate steering committee.

				<h4>Treating for fun</h4>
				<p>
					This comment from a  group of expatriate doctors in Nepal refers to the phenomenon of "medical  tourism" in developing countries - western health professionals holding ad hoc  clinics in rural parts of developing countries, without a local licence to  practice, an understanding of the local culture, prevalent illnesses. "If an  unregistered Nepali doctor on holiday in the United Kingdom offered general  medical consultations in a shopping centre there would be a public and  professional outcry."
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical tourism done by  individual 'do-gooders' as well as through organised groups, in both cases  without the consent or involvement of the local system.

				<h4>The academic - industry nexus</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial on the  growing ties between academic medical institutions and the pharmaceutical  industry notes that the listing of authors' financial ties, for an article in  the journal, was so long that it could not be printed in full. Ties range from  grant support to consultancies, royalty agreements, listed authorship, gifts  and equity interest in the companies. Harvard Medical School recently relaxed  guidelines on such financial ties, ostensibly to prevent the loss of star  faculty members to other schools.
				</p>
				<p>
					The writer makes a forceful argument against this trend, and against the  various arguments used to justify it. The academic-industry link does not  improve the quality of research, but it does give the companies more  credibility. Nor does it enable these centres to fulfill their mission of  education, research and clinical care. Medical students and house officers  learn to rely too much on drugs and devices, and begin a long and cosy  relationship with the industry. Research becomes biased toward drugs and  devices which have a market value, and less on the causes and mechanisms of  disease. Finally, financial ties can influence the outcome of research studies.  And the money spent on influencing researchers through industry-sponsored  trips, gifts, conferences and the like are added to the prices consumers pay  for drugs and devices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author calls for a change in these practices. The academic medical  community should adopt stronger conflict-of-interest guidelines, not dilute  them further.

				<h4>Commercial research organisations</h4>
				<p>
					This interview-based  report discusses another trend, that of the growing use by the pharmaceutical  industry, of commercial research organisations (CROs) for drug trials.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the new emphasis on chronic diseases, drug research needs long, large and  multi-centre trials for statistical validity. Drug companies find that  the teaching and clinical responsibilities of academic medical centres slow  down the research process. Companies can contract with CROs for everything from  study design onwards. They recruit patients through academic centers as well as  community physicians, and may subcontract some of the work to site management  organisations. Fighting to regain their  lost market shares, academic centres are transforming themselves into research  networks to compete with the commercial drug-trial sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The industry now writes trial protocols themselves. Important studies which  might reduce drug sales are vetoed. Studies are designed with samples, dosages  and end points all to favour their products. Data are controlled by the  commercial organisation rather than the principal investigators. The results  are written by a ghost writer, and the listed authorship often includes people  who did not analyse the data or write the manuscript. Industry controls to a  greater or lesser extent the publication of results, delaying unfavourable  results, sometimes suppressing them altogether from publication.

				<h4>HIV and getting pregnant</h4>
				<p>
					This essay discusses the  options of an HIV-positive man and his IVnegative partner, who wish to have a  child. At present, there is no recognised method to inseminate an  HIVseronegative woman with the ejaculate of an HIV-sero-positive man and be  certain that the woman will not sero-convert. There is no recognised technique  for washing the sperm or extracting the HIV or treating the ejaculate to render  it non-infective, though an Italian group reports the use of such a technique,  and a test group of 10 discordant couples will soon be studied in the US using  a similar technique with <em>in vitro</em> fertilization.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should they risk unprotected sex since the man has had an undetectable viral  load for years? Should they consider adoption, or insemination by an HIV-negative  donor?
				</p>
				<p>
					This case study discusses and quantifies the known risks, and concludes that  "the odds that Linda won't become infected and their child will be born  healthy". In fact, the couple conclude that "the consequences of an unwanted  outcome are so dire and so irreparable that... the risk is not worth it."  However, this article proposes that such couples be given complete information  in order that they can make their own choices.

				<h4>Race and health care</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial comments on an article in the same issue of the journal  which found that blacks and Latinos were less likely than whites to get common  prescription medications because pharmacies in non-white areas didn't stock  opioids, apparently fearing theft and illicit drug use, and claiming that there  was little demand. Blacks are likely to be refused morphine-based pain-killers when prescribed them. They are likely to be inadequately treated for  cancer-related pain, though they have a higher incidence of and death rate  from cancer than other groups. (In the next issue of the journal, a review of  medical records on poor patients in the US with acute myocardial infarction  needing re-perfusion therapy found that white patients were more likely to  receive this potentially life-saving therapy than were blacks.)
				</p>
				<p>
					A growing body of evidence points to inferior medical care for black Americans,  even if they are on an equal economic footing with whites. These findings have  been confirmed in many other studies looking at pain relief, curative surgery  for cancer, likelihood of renal transplantation, diagnostic work-ups for  coronary artery disease... These remain true regardless of socioeconomic status,  insurance coverage, or access to care. The common thread is a racial bias on  the part of medical care providers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The writer recommends awareness campaigns among medical trainees and  professionals, and establishing and monitoring standards of medical care.

				<h4>Religion and end of life care</h4>
				<p>
					What should doctors do  when a patient in intensive care is declared brain stem dead, but is still  alive according to their family's religious beliefs? Two paediatric intensive  care specialists, supported by a former rabbi, describe how they kept their patient,  an orthodox Jew, on mechanical ventilation without monitoring, antibiotic  treatment, resuscitation in the event of an arrhythmia, endotracheal suction or  renal support, until she died from "natural" causes. Their message: families  should not be pressurised on this subject, and consulting religious authorities  can arrive at compromises acceptable to both religious beliefs and those of the  medical staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, two ICU specialists argue that there are also the interests  of the medical and paramedical staff and the community at large. Continuing  treatment may be using the individual as a means to achieve the family's ends.  It can go on for months, and provoke staff resentment about the apparent misuse  of scarce resources or the compromise of the patient's dignity. Third, this  logic should require respecting those of all religious groups, even if they are  unacceptable to medical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally the question of organ transplant  raises a number of difficult issues. Respecting this religious perspective  would exclude cadaveric organ donation, making organ transplant more difficult  for religious-ethnic groups which do not recognise brain stem death. Also,  should transplantation be made available to groups whose religious beliefs  prevent them from donation? If not, should they be offered the more expensive  option of renal dialysis &mdash; when they have effectively rejected the cheaper  option of transplant on non-medical grounds?

				<h4>Clinical response to intersex disorders</h4>
				<p>
					"What is the relation  among anatomy, sexual identity, and sexual practices? The authors of Intersex  in the Age of Ethics argue that an ethical clinical response to intersexuality (i.  e., the intermingling, in varying degrees, of male and female sex  characteristics) will be possible only when this question can be answered on  the basis of well-documented, long-term case studies of the lives of  intersexual persons. To date, this information has not been collected and  clinical practice is based on ill-founded assumptions."
				</p>
				<p>
					Reviews of the changing medical response are interspersed with first-person  accounts by intersexual people and their families. The editor argues that the  relations among anatomy, sexual identity, and sexual practices can vary  extremely, and until this subject is better understood, medical intervention  for intersex characteristics should be delayed till the person can make an  informed choice about the options.

				<h4>What do patients really want?</h4>
				<p>
					This qualitative study  of 35 patients aimed to investigate what patients had in mind when they saw a  doctor, whether their agendas were addressed in the consultation, and the  consequences of not addressing patients' needs. The study found that patients' agendas  are complex, and rarely fully voiced during the consultation. Patients  described symptoms and asked for information on the diagnosis, but rarely  shared other important issues such as anxieties about what the diagnosis  entailed, and side effects. As a result there were several major  misunderstandings such as unwanted prescriptions, non-use of prescriptions,  non-adherence to treatment, and poor health outcomes. The authors point out  that when patients do not voice their needs, they cannot be addressed by  doctors. "Steps should be taken in both daily clinical practice and research to  encourage the voicing of patients' agendas."

				<h4>Violence and doctors</h4>
				<p>
					This issue of Lancet carries a collection of essays on some of the less  familiar intersections between medicine and violence. They also highlight why  many medical practitioners resent being expected to act as society's moral  leaders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many doctors feel irritated at being called upon to be activists in the cause  of violence prevention. This writer points out that such advocacy can work at  different levels. Doctors can use their credibility to support arguments they  believe in. Second, medical research can measure health problems caused by  violence. Third, doctors can do their job well. Though a woman is at increased  risk of violence if her partner abuses alcohol, a US study found that 94 per  cent of primary-care physicians failed to include substance abuse among the  five diagnoses they offered when presented with early symptoms of alcohol abuse  in an adult patient. Doctors don't need to wave banners or make speeches, in order  to prevent violence. Just doing their job will make a difference.
