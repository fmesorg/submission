				We visited Anand-Kheda(between Baroda and  Ahmedabad). Sixty people died in the riots here, and thousands were rendered  homeless in approximately 125 villages. Victims have received scant support  from the government and voluntary organisations.</p>
				<p>Reports of insomnia, startle  reactions, fearfulness, intrusive memories and sadness are common. The commonest  coping method has been prayer. The women and the elderly appear  depressed; young males appear very angry. Children are also affected.  Spiritual leaders have been largely silent. Victims fear returning to  their homes, and the state government's order to close relief camps on the eve  of the monsoons has aggravated existing stress. </p>
				<p>
					The victims of communal violence in Gujarat have  experienced extraordinary physical and psychological trauma. These pains  are compounded by government inaction against the perpetrators of violence, and  by the lack of support from outside their community.
				</p>
				<p>
					The experience of a disaster can trigger off  intense emotional reactions, sometimes highly individual in nature. Sometimes  the reaction is delayed. Sometimes it can lead to considerable disability. Most  people may not need professional help, but support from family and friends is  critical. Psychological symptoms can persist decades after the traumatic event.

				<h4>Mental health response to  disaster in India</h4>
				<p>
					Overall, the mental health response following  large-scale trauma in India has been from a psychiatric perspective, ignoring  the multiple influences on people's experiences of, and responses to, a  disaster. What is needed is a psychosocial perspective viewing victims in their  cultural milieu. Further, there has been insufficient documentation of work,  very little sharing within the mental health community, and a preoccupation  with research without an 'action' component.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were isolated psychosocial interventions following  the 1992-93 riots in Bombay. Such relief was provided for the first time  through lay mental health workers, after the Kandla cyclone. Relief after the  Orissa cyclone and the Bhuj earthquake also had a mental health component.  Voluntary organisations played an important part .
				</p>
				<p>
				There are many barriers to an adequate psychosocial  response to large-scale trauma. The country has only 7,000 mental professionals  spread unequally across different states. The field focuses on treating  individual patients rather than communities. Mental health professionals are  not experienced with negotiating with NGOs, or working with the development  model necessary in the context of a disaster. Social work institutes may jump  on to the bandwagon to make their presence felt but abandon the field without  setting a long-term process in motion. Some NGOs' efforts are dictated by the  availability of financial grants, preventing a long-term intervention. Finally,  there is a lack of awareness about mental health issues across all target  groups.</p>
				<p>People working in mental health will also have to reflect on the  conflicts between religious identity and professional responsibility. This is a  requisite for post-riot counseling, also important during times of peace. </p>
				<p>
					Further, some activists have biases obstructing  equitable counseling to all affected people. For example, after the Bhuj  earthquake, some activists stopped me from going to homes of a particular  community stating that they were rich and required no help. Grief is universal;  mental health intervention must reach all hearts.

				<h4>Mental health professionals in  Gujarat</h4>
				<p>
				In Gujarat, mental health professionals from  Ahmedabad have been working with violence victims in government hospitals and  in relief camps. However, the response has been feeble when compared to the  Bhuj earthquake. The most important reason for this is the fear and uncertainty  of the situation. Second, the sanction of the violence by a large majority has  affected mental health professionals as well. They are also restricted by the  absence of institutional mechanisms to provide systematic relief.</p>
				<p>Gujarat needs  a long-term plan for community-based psychosocial intervention using  volunteers. The key actors should be disaster workers, primary care workers,  teachers, medical professionals and social activists. Training must include  some counseling skills, briefing on social issues, team building, and breaking  stereotypes. This must be a government-mandated effort with inputs from  specialists close to the affected region. </p>
				<p>
					Every riot victim has a right to mental health  relief for a reasonable period, provided by the State. Research or assessments  must include an action component; victims should not be viewed as a laboratory.  Counsellors must plan to work on long-term conflict resolution. They must move  to the centre of the disaster zone, not hide in the periphery.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Gujarat, the mental health fraternity was  silent fearing the disruption of 'therapeutic neutrality'. This is  actually a denial of professional responsibility. Mental health  professionals need not be sloganeers, but they must raise sane voices during  difficult times. A small minority has made active efforts and taken stands, but  on the whole, silence has transformed the profession's empathy into apathy. This  collective silence must be broken with concerted action toward healing and  prevention.
