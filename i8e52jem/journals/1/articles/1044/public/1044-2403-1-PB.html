				<h4>Law Commission guidelines on withdrawal of life support</h4>
				<p>
					The Law Commission has said that a panel of medical experts can decide whether life-support may be withdrawn from the terminally ill. Patients and their relatives should notify a high court of the decision so that the doctor is immune from legal action. The commission maintained that "the withdrawal of life support to terminally ill patients has always been held lawful in all countries while euthanasia is and continues to be unlawful." It has recommended setting up a three-member panel of reputed medical persons having at least 20 years' experience to clear the decision to withdraw life support.

				<h4>Documenting sexual assault: doctors ignore the evidence</h4>
				<p>
					The Delhi police arrested two doctors and a nursing orderly of the Employees' State Insurance hospital on charges of destroying evidence in the rape and assault of a resident doctor. Police claim that chief medical officer Sunil Kumar Ravi, gynaecologist Arun and orderly HR Meena wiped out all clues that might have helped investigators. Officers said the doctors initially tried to mislead the police by saying that the victim had tried to commit suicide. There were visible strangulation marks on her neck as well as several bruises on other parts of her body which the doctors chose to ignore. The victim's clothes that she was wearing at the time of the assault are missing.

A doctor handling the medico legal case at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences stated that the boy enjoyed the sexual act as a "passive agent".

				<p>
					The police surgeon has issued a notice to four staffers attached to the Bhagwati Post Mortem Centre in Mumbai following reports that Abhijeet Gawde, the doctor on duty, was giving staff telephonic instructions on conducting autopsies and issuing certificates. The matter came to light when a sub inspector came to the centre to get a post-mortem done on his relative and noticed that the post-mortem was being done even though there was no doctor present. Dr Gawde was trapped by the anti-corruption bureau on the following day for demanding and accepting money from another doctor to write a favourable report.

					Anaesthetist Santosh Chaudhary, who along with his gynaecologist wife Sayli Chaudhary owns Mahesh Hospital in Kalyan, was beaten up and the hospital was ransacked by family and friends of a patient who had died in the hospital. The crowd held that the doctor's negligence had been responsible. Chitra Gulwe was recovering after treatment at Mahesh Hospital when she suddenly took ill. She was given artificial respiration for an hour but had died by the time the doctor arrived. As the news of her death spread, some 1,000 people gathered at the hospital, ransacked it and also assaulted the doctor. When the police arrived, the mob demanded that the doctor be arrested for negligence. The senior inspector of police stated that they would have to wait for a post-mortem report and the opinion of the medical council before deciding on whether to file a case against the doctor.

				<h4>Desperate times call for desperate measures</h4>

					The Andhra Pradesh government gave its approval to an ordinance making assault on doctors a non-bailable offence. This was in response to the demands of 5,000 junior doctors in 10 teaching hospitals across the state. The doctors were on strike protesting attacks on them by patients' relatives. The ordinance, the first of its kind, makes attacks on doctors, nursing staff or any paramedic a non-bailable offence. The guilty can be sentenced to three years' imprisonment. While the government doctors' association resumed work, junior doctors stated that the strike could not be called off as the government was yet to deploy special police force at all teaching hospitals in the state and arrest the politicians who had instigated the latest attacks.

				<h4>Public private partnerships: for dialysis</h4>

					The Bombay Municipal Corporation proposes to outsource dialysis facilities in its Rajawadi hospital to a non-governmental organisation, Red Swastik Society, under a 10-year contract. The NGO will set up five units within the hospital, paying the BMC Rs 5,000 monthly. Three of the five beds will be reserved for municipal patients who will be charged Rs 250 per dialysis. The others will be for private patients who will be charged Rs 450. The patients will also have to pay the cost of the dialysis kits. At present dialysis is available in three municipal hospitals that are able to dialyse 50 to 60 patients daily.

					Hyderabad once had the dubious distinction of having the worst female-male sex ratio in Andhra Pradesh (dropping from 962 girls for 1,000 boys in 1991 to 941/1,000 in the 2001 census). This current sex ratio in the district is 1,014 girls for 1,000 boys in the age group 0-5 years. This was done by mobilising women doctors and also monitoring the 800 scan centres in the city. With 2,032 scan centres, the state of Andhra Pradesh ranks third in the number of such centres, next only to Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

The shortage follows a post-vaccine death after which the batch of vaccines was withdrawn. Though the tests cleared the vaccine, the stocks have not been released in the market, resulting in a shortage of this critical vaccine.

The state government has been spending money setting up delivery huts all over Haryana to bring down maternal and infant mortality rates.

Yogesh was taken to the Aurangabad government medical college's centre for treatment after he was bitten by a dog. He was administered two doses of the anti-rabies serum free of cost but then referred to the municipal hospital. According to reports, the government hospital declined further treatment as his family was not categorised as "below the poverty line".  There is no information on whether he continued treatment but he died two months after the dog bite. Aurangabad medical college dean Nandkumar Dravid confirmed that Yogesh was referred to the municipal hospital for treatment. "Though he was not below the poverty line we provided him the initial two doses free of cost. Since he was staying in an urban area he was referred to the civic hospital. After that we lost track of him." The anti-rabies vaccine costs Rs 1,500 for the five-dose course.

				<h4>Mental hospitals: inhuman 20 years ago, inhuman today</h4>
				<p>
					In June 1987, following public interest litigation, a committee set up by the chief justice of the Bombay High Court visited the four government-run mental hospitals in Maharashtra - at Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Ratnagiri - and made 68 recommendations. These included: patients should be kept in a humane environment and treated with dignity; bathrooms and toilets should be clean; each patient should be given a cot, a mattress and clean linen that is changed regularly; patients should receive baths daily; and patients should be given an individual treatment plan prepared by experts. "Most of our recommendations did not involve any financial burden... but they were still not implemented," pointed out VR Mahajan, head of the committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					Twenty years later, an inspection report on the same hospitals, filed by the principal secretary of public health before the Bombay High Court, has confirmed that they are still in a pathetic condition. There is a staff shortage at all levels. Little has been done to fill vacancies since the 1987 report. Two hundred and fifty four of the 1,155 sanctioned posts for the Pune hospital are vacant; 166 of 834 in Thane, 144 of 481 in Nagpur, and 62 of 214 in Ratnagiri. While in Nagpur all patients had cots, there was a shortage of 1,110 cots in Pune and 580 in Ratnagiri. In Thane, there were only 100 cots for 1,300 inmates, the refrigerator was not working and the kitchen was dirty.

				<h4>Doctors and the system: recording cause of death</h4>
				<p>
					122 conservancy workers died between April and September 2007, according to statistics provided by the Bombay Municipal Corporation's department of solid waste management, following an application under the Right To Information Act. Two hundred and eighty eight died in 2004-5, 246 in 2005-6, and 247 till April 2006. The average age at time of death is 50 years. The corporation did not give the cause of death, stating that the medical cause is not recorded in the death certificate. Activist Kewal Semlani who obtained these figures, moved the Bombay high court to convert the public interest litigation into a criminal writ petition, claiming that the high rate of death is a blatant case of criminal negligence in providing those working in hazardous jobs with safety gear. These deaths are only among workers who sweep the streets; these are only part of the department's 22,000 strong workforce that includes sewerage workers who clean manholes, storm water drain workers, biomedical waste workers and morgue staff.
