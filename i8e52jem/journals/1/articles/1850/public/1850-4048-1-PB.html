					The epidemics in Beed  and Surat highlighted lapses on the part of medical professionals.

				<h4>Was it truly the  plague?</h4>
				<p>
					When newspapers  splashed banner headlines proclaiming the infectious, pneumonic form of plague  in Surat, no medical scientist asked this question.
				</p>
				<p>
					The diagnosis of any bacterial infection is made when Koch's  postulates are satisfied. As we write this, we do not know whether the plague  bacillus has been cultured. We learn from fragmentary reports in the newspapers  that the organism has been identified by the National Institute for  Communicable Diseases (NICD). Is it not the responsibility of NICD to provide  details to the public at large and to the medical community?
				</p>
				<p>
					Diagnosis has been based on the hemagglutination test, positive  at titre of 1:8. We need positive results at much greater dilution or rising  titres for making a conclusive diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the NICD will not  part with essential data should not the medical profession insist on its  release? Is it not unscientific and unethical to treat patients for a disease  without proof of its existence and permit panic and chaos which may have no  basis?
				</p>

				<h4>Matters of prestige  and priority?</h4>
				<p>
					Haffkine Institute  asked scientists at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and at  NICD to send tissue samples and bacteriological specimens collected by them for  study. They have been rebuffed. News reports suggest that, there is infighting  between workers at AIIMS and NICD.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the lives of  large segments of the population are at stake, our economy has been dealt  crippling blows and the reputation of the country has taken a battering, is it  correct for medical personnel to stand on prestige or the lure of being the  first to report and publish data?
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Unconcern or  incompetence?</h4>
				<p>
					Senior research  workers at the Haffkine Institute were refused permission to travel to Surat at  the height of the epidemic to collect samples of tissue from the victims for  study.
				</p>
				<p>
					What was the basis'  for such refusal? Is it not the concern of the centre which for the first time  ever provided the vaccine against plague to work on the new outbreak?
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Assuming it is remedy  against the plague, what is the it?</h4>
				<p>
					For several days after  it hit the headlines no one pointed out that the plague germ is easily  vanquished by modern antibiotics.
				</p>
				<p>
					The astonishing publicity given to tetracycline as the answer  against Yersinia pestis led to panic-stricken hordes rushing to empty the  shelves of this antibiotic. The fact that co-trimoxazole and several newer  antibiotics are equally effective was either not mentioned at all or published  in fine print.
				</p>
				<p>
					No one pointed out that to prevent the disease, attendants of a  patient with proven pneumonic plague should be vaccinated against it. Since'the  vaccine takes ten days or so to produce immunity against the germ, the person  should take any one of the several antibiotics effective against the plague germ  for these ten days. Had this been widely publicised we might have been spared  the insane rush for tetracycline.
