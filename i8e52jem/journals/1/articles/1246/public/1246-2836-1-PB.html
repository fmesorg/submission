I was disappointed that no one bothered  to discuss the important role patients can play in improving the ethical  standards of medical practice. Why do doctors assume that they are the center  of the medical universe, and that patients cannot be trusted to make their own  decisions ? If good doctors spend time and energy in educating their patients,  standards of medical practice would improve, as patients would then have tools  they could use to evaluate the quality of their medical care - and the quality  of their doctor-patient education can help to weed out quacks and unethical  doctors who make unrealistic promises.

				<h4>In a minority, but not alone</h4>
				<p>
					Dr Bawaskar, in his two pieces in the last two  issues of the journal, has briefly shared with us his principled, ethical  conduct in his clinical professional work <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bawaskar HS. Am I a bogus doctor? Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 138." id="7">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bawaskar HS. General practice in rural areas. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 14." id="8">2)</a>. I am writing this to say that  he is not alone. There is a small but significant section of doctors who have  been keeping away from the lures of drug companies and other medical companies,  and trying to do justice to their patients. What is needed is that such doctors  should keep in touch with each other, share their experiences, and act  together, whenever there is such a chance, to oppose unethical practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					One blatantly unethical practice is being promoted  currently by the NORMA company, which sells compression stockings for varicose  veins etc. A flier by this company offers doctors one Parker pen for every  'client' brought by the doctor to the company. This flier announces
				</p>
				<p>
					"Write a NORMA prescription worth Rs. 500/-  get a parker pen worth Rs. 50/- free. Send us the prescribed patient's order  form along with a D.D. of the appropriate amount."
				</p>
				<p>
					What can we do collectively to stop this practice?  The first step is to appeal doctors through various professional journals not  to be party to this 'trade-off'. Second, some of us can jointly write to the  concerned company that it should stop this unethical marketing. If we can get  some well-known doctors to sign this letter, it will have more impact.

				<h4>Sense of service?</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Below is a copy of a letter sent to Dr K A Dinshaw,  director of the Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai. It is reproduced with the  permission of the author, who brought it to our notice.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dear Dr Dinshaw,
				</p>
				<p>
					My wife, a senior citizen over 67 years old, took  advantage of the free cancer check-up organised by your Preventive Oncology in  March this year.
				</p>
				<p>
					The experience she had at the TMC was, to say the  least, horrifying. She was pushed from pillar to post, sent up and down floors,  between buildings and traversing long corridors. All this could have been  obviated if there was even a semblance of planning on the part of the  organisers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, she went because she had been asked to  'collect' the reports. It was the same story of being pushed around  interminably. And after collecting the reports and the signatures of the  doctors, the counter clerk took the entire file and said she could leave. She  asked for the reports for her records, for which she had been specifically  called there. She was told that the file remained with the TMC; she doesn't get  any report from the file.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, what was the propriety in calling her there  at all if she was not to be given the reports or the copies thereof? Surely,  they could have themselves made arrangements by which all reports are sent to  one central record section for filing and records? Second, what is the  point of getting the examination done if patients can't have the reports or  copies thereof for their records? There was no element of courtesy at any  stage, leave aside any sense of service, in any of the staff or the doctors she  had the misfortune to be pitted against.
				</p>
				<p>
					Admittedly, this was a free camp. But, does it mean  that the patients should be treated as beggars? Better not to have such free  camps at all, in that case. And, it is not only in cases of free camps but even  in cases of paying patients, the treatment meted out to them is no better.
				</p>
				<p>
					You, Dr Dinshaw, and most of your senior colleagues  must have travelled far and wide. Why can't you train up your staff and doctors  to come up to the level of service and dedication you find in, say, the UK and  the US?
				</p>
				<p>
					I sincerely hope that you will be able to bring in substantial  improvement in the outlook of all your staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours truly,
				</p>

				<h4>Rights violations in population  policies</h4>
				<p>
					We reproduce, below, a letter written to Justice JS  Varma Chair, National Human Rights Commission New Delhi. The letter  in its extracted form is in the print edition of the same issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Justice J.S.Varma Chair,
					<br>
					National Human Rights Commission
					<br>
					New Delhi
				</p>
				<p>
					Dear Sir,
				</p>
				<p>
					We, representatives of women's groups and health  groups, are deeply disturbed by several issues pertaining to population  policies in our country.
				</p>
				<p>
					In February 2000, the Government of India adopted  the National Population Policy 2000. One undoubtedly positive feature of the  policy is that it resolutely affirms the "commitment of the government  towards voluntary and informed choice and consent of citizens while availing of  reproductive health care services, and continuation of the target free approach  in administering family planning services".
				</p>
				<p>
					It is thus profoundly disturbing that several State  governments have announced population policies, which, in very significant  ways, violate the letter and the spirit of the National Population Policy.  Annexure I provides a summary of these State Population Policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Press reports (Outlook, 29th April 2002, <em>Hindustan Times,</em> 23rd April 2002, Annexures III and IV) indicate that, instead of preventing  these distortions, the Union cabinet is considering a "Strategy  Paper"(Annexure V) to review the national family welfare programme and  policy which also violates the spirit of the NPP.
				</p>
				<p>
					We would also like to bring to your notice, a Bill  that has been framed in Uttar Pradesh, the Uttar Pradesh Population Control  Bill, 2002 (Annexure VI). This Bill codifies all the anti-human rights features  of the State Population Policies that we have referred to. This Bill is clearly  violative of the provisions of the NPP 2000.
				</p>
				<p>
					You would notice that the State population policies  contain a series of disincentives and incentives that are anti-women,  anti-adivasis, anti-dalit and anti-poor in general. They also are profoundly  violative of human and democratic rights.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The disincentives proposed, such as denying  ration cards and education in government schools for the third child,  withdrawal of a range of welfare programmes for the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes with more than two children, debarring such people from  government jobs etc. are questionable on various grounds. The National Family Health Survey for  1998-99 shows that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is 3.15 for S.Cs, 3.06 for  S.Ts, 2.66 among O.B.Cs and 3.47 among illiterate women as a whole. It is, in  contrast, 1.99 among better off women and those likely to be educated beyond  the tenth grade. Imposition of the two-child norm, and the disincentives  proposed, would thus mean that significant sections among those already  deprived populations would bear the brunt of the state's withdrawal of  ameliorative measures, as pitiably inadequate as they are.
					</li>
					<li>
						The two-child norm bars large sections of  dalits, adivasis and the poor in general from contesting elections to the PRIs  and thus deprives them of their democratic rights. Further, in the States where  they have been imposed, as in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we are  aware of substantial numbers of women who have been deserted, or forced to  undergo sex selective abortions. In general, such a norm provides an impetus  for an increase in sex-selective abortions, worsening an already terrible child  sex ratio in the country.
					</li>
					<li>
						As the NPP itself acknowledges, there is a large  need for health and safe contraceptive services. To propose punitive measures  in this context is clearly absurd. Reflecting deprivation, the dalits, adivasis  and Other Backward Castes bear a significantly higher proportion of the  mortality load in the country. The National Family Health Survey for 1998-99,  notes that the Infant Mortality Rate among the S.Cs, S.T.s and Other Backward  Castes is 83, 84 and 76 respectively, compared to 62 for Others. Similarly the  Under Five Mortality Rate is 119 among the S.Cs, 126 among the S.T.s 103 among  the O.B.Cs compared to 82 among the Others. Clearly, to impose a two-child norm  under such circumstances is to widen the inequality gap among our people.  Instead of dealing with the causes for these differentials, what the state  population policies seek do is to punish victims for their poverty and  deprivation.
					</li>
					<li>
						The proposals violate several fundamental  rights, the Directive Principles of the Constitution of India, as well as  several international Covenants that India is signatory to, including the ICRC,  CEDAW as well as the Beijing Platform of Action and the Cairo Declaration.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We are astonished to learn from the press reports  referred to earlier, that the Union Cabinet could consider discussing the so  called strategy paper which does not have the imprimatur of either the National  Population Commission or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The  anonymous document thus does not carry the mandate of any statutory, advisory  or decision-making body.
				</p>
				<p>
					The document itself is poorly substantiated by  data, deeply contradictory and shockingly at variance with the National  Population Policy 2000. Although the NPP 2000 can be described as weak on many  counts, it is firmly committed to respect for human rights, freedom and dignity  of women, values that all of us cherish. These were translated into a  non-target oriented family welfare programme, which rightly abjured incentives  and disincentives. The NPP, as we noted earlier, recognises that there is a  large and unmet need for quality health and reproductive and child health  services; it also recognises that infant mortality rates are still  unconscionably high and that there is an urgent need to strengthen health  services, attending particularly to the needs of the poor and the marginalised.  Above all, it recognises the need for quality services which respect the  dignity of people, even as it emphasises equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Strategy Paper", on the other hand,  is drafted in the a-historical and unscientific language of Malthusian  scare-mongering. While it recognises that infrastructure is weak, and that the  quality and coverage of health services are poor, it absurdly attributes these  failures of the State primarily to population growth. While it recognises that  there is an adverse sex ratio, it is not averse to calling for a two-child  national norm when it is absolutely clear that such norms have indeed  contributed to the adverse sex ratio. While it recognises that there is an  unmet need for health and family welfare services, it contradictorily calls for  a range of incentives and disincentives, holding up Andhra Pradesh as an  example. Further, it argues, incorrectly, that China continues to have a  one-child norm. In any case, comparisons between India and China are inapposite  for a large number of reasons, including per-capita incomes, achievements in  health, equity and education that India can unfortunately not boast of.  Finally, the so-called strategy paper invidiously suggests that concern for  rights and equity are current only in NGOs financially supported by UNFPA.
				</p>
				<p>
					It needs to be put on record that we had, even  before the ICPD, and indeed with no links to the UNFPA, critiqued the family  planning policy as it then existed. The population policy in the country, it  was noted, "has been one of fertility control, pursued relentlessly, and  at times coercively, bringing disrepute to the family planning programme and  compromising women's health and accelerating the declining sex ratio". It  is possibly in the light of such critiques, along with the commitments made at  the ICPD at Cairo, that the NPP 2000 abjures targets, incentives, disincentives  and specifying a two-child norm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depriving children of their rights to survival and  development is not only violative of the International Convention on the Rights  of the Child, but also of successive directives of the Supreme Court to enhance  their right to education. We request the NHRC to direct States to comply with these  directives and not use population policies to deny these rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments sought  to strengthen and expand the base for India's democratic governance by  providing Constitutional recognition to local self-government bodies. The  States' legislations on Panchayati Raj providing disqualifications on the basis  of the two-child norm, invariably cite the National Population Policy as the  rationale for such restrictive and punitive measure for elected representatives  of the Panchayats, when the National Population Policy does not provide such a  norm. Moreover, similar disqualifications are absent for representatives  elected to State Assemblies and Parliament. We request the NHRC to take  cognisance of this violation of Constitutional rights, and direct States to  strike down these provisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally we urge you to take necessary measures  to ensure that steps proposed in the so-called "Strategy Paper" and  the U.P.Population Control Bill that violate human rights are not now included  in the population policy.

				<h4>Doctors in Pakistan and India  against war</h4>
				<p>
					As a million soldiers face each other across the  volatile line of control and the border between India and Pakistan, the  arguments have shifted from no use of nuclear weapons to their potential use in  the event of conventional war, to the current state of actual deployment...a  nuclear first strike becomes a frighteningly real possibility...
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast to the nuclear disarmament appeals from  a few years ago, most of the medical associations on both sides of the border  have maintained an ominous silence... (One) explanation is that few among the  health professionals are even remotely aware of the true meaning and  consequences of a nuclear conflict....
				</p>
				<p>
					The current nuclear imbroglio in India and Pakistan  is a direct consequence of a lack of human and social development in the  region. Malnutrition rates in the region are among the highest in the world,  and successive generations have been fed a daily gruel of intolerance,  jingoism, and religious fervour by political and military governments. The  current military standoff must also be viewed in the context of the growth of  religious intolerance and lack of social development in both countries. A  conservative estimate of the costs of nuclear weaponisation in India placed it  at well over $10bn and although modest by comparison, it is sobering to note  that Pakistan's recent ballistic missile tests alone could have funded the  entire health budget of several districts...
				</p>
				<p>
					With Hindu extremists tugging at its sleeves and  Islamic militants attempting to trigger an all-out conflict, neither India nor  Pakistan possesses stable command and control systems ensuring that an  accidental conflict will not be triggered ... The only prudent way ahead for the  leadership of the two countries is to step back from the brink and start  substantive discussions and political dialogue. The large cadre of health  professionals and societies in both countries, as indeed globally, must assume  responsibility for the promotion of peace, and eventual nuclear disarmament.
