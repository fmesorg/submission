				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					One of my concerns after joining a cancer hospital was the manner of conveying the diagnosis to the  patient with cancer. Most of us receive little formal training on this aspect  of medicine during undergraduate and postgraduate training. All I can recall is  telling the relatives of patients with acute myocardial infraction or stroke of  a 25% possibility of death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Observing  the approach of colleagues has been of little help. Some colleagues embark on a  very positive approach; giving the patient and relatives hope (albeit false)  and believing that the patient is blissful in his ignorance. Others take a  middle path and explain all the facts to the relatives while keeping the  patient in the dark. Few explain at length the diagnosis, stage of cancer,  options on treatment, side effects, financial burden and short and long term  prognosis. Thereby they upset some patients and families.

				<h4>Keeping the diagnosis from the patient</h4>
				<p>
					<em>'Please do not tell the  patient that he has cancer.'</em> is a frequent request made to me by relatives. I recently came across a  situation where the relative who accompanied and then looked after a bachelor  patient with terminal cancer kept the patient and other relatives in the dark  and managed to change the patient's will before his death. Many factors such as  illiteracy, ignorance, misconception, superstition, domestic and social  problems, fatalistic attitudes and . other prejudices add hurdles to the  information process. Patients returning with recurrence or progression of  disease complain about the lack of proper information during the primary  treatment. I soon realised that there is no simple solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Osler  cautioned those dealing with fatal illness: <em>'It is not for you to don the black cap and  assuming the judicial function, take hope away from any patient... hope that  comes to us all.'</em> Unfortunately, several  medico-legal and ethical factors make us don the black cap.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Relevant issues</h4>
				<p>
					The first issue concerns  the confidentiality of doctor-patient relationship. Can the doctor discuss the  illness with the relatives and friends who accompany the patient, without first  telling the patient about his disease and obtaining his permission to tell  others? Second, because of the Consumer Protection Act and the high cost of  investigating, treating and supporting patients with cancer, should we not  inform the patients fully about the disease, the benefits, complications and  economic costs before he signs the consent form? Third, many cancer therapies  are still experimental and can be provided only in the setting of a clinical  trial. Bearing in mind the ethical aspects of experimental therapies, a fully  informed, written consent needs be obtained. Would not informing the brave ones  lead to selection bias in studies? Fourth, many patients with advanced disease,  already told the nature of their illness, come for a second verdict with lots  of hope.
				</p>

				<h4>Attitudes towards cancer</h4>
				<p>
					In India, the fear and  hopelessness engendered by the diagnosis of cancer is very strong and is often  based on hearsay or anecdotal experience of relatives or friends. The degree to  which people are adversely affected by the diagnosis of cancer is related to  the individual's ability to adapt and come to terms with thoughts and feelings  focused on their own mortality and altered body image.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  the West, some are unhappy with the diagnosis of cancer but most surveys  indicate that the majority of patients seek more information from their  doctors. Although the number of doctors in the West who shy away from  disclosing the diagnosis of cancer to their patients has decreased, there are  many who genuinely believe that what the patients do not know will not harm  them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  convenient practice would be to give information only to those patients who  actively seek it. The ideal balance between frankness and details that may  provoke is not universally established, nor is it the same for all patients. In  cancer, more than in any other illness, the dynamic view emphasises the  beneficial effects of participation by the patient on the outcome of therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					For  many cancers there are no standard treatments and for many others different  therapies provide similar results. Furthermore, conflict of interest between  various specialists (surgeon, chemotherapist, radiotherapist) results in  raising the hopes beyond those justified by the facts.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Possible solutions</h4>
				<p>
					The specialist  dominated, often autocratic, approach to cancer treatment, the standard pattern  in the 1960s in USA and UK, has undergone a change to a more open dialogue  where the patient and physician are equal partners in decision making. A multi-dimensional approach is required to meet physical, psychological, social and  spiritual needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  need for specific information varies between patients. In general, patients  wish to be well informed about the diagnosis, therapeutic options, side effects  and outlook. Some prefer details. Others are content with limited information.  Still others prefer to have the possibilities of complications minimised or  blunted. Breaking bad news therefore requires skills in communication and an  understanding of the patient's mind and preferences.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  can take a cue from screening for AIDS and counsel all those who are afraid to  face the diagnosis of cancer. Since up to 75% of patients with cancer in the  west seek aliernative therapies that offer hope, another approach may be to  provide non-conventional therapy under the same roof.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once  I have identified the brave ones after a few meetings, I prefer to talk  directly to them. For those who are scared, I disclose the news first to the  spouse or a major son or daughter. As rapport builds up during therapy more  information can be provided directly to the patient. Unfortunately, many  patients with advanced disease come for a single consultation when palliation  of symptoms is only therapy. Should we tell these patients the bitter truth? I  follow Ambroise Pare's advice: <em>'Always give the patient hope, even when death  seems at hand.'</em> I believe that if your  time has not come, even your doctor can't take you away.

				<h4>Notice</h4>
				<p>
					The Ministry of  Information &amp; Broadcasting, Government of India has allocated the title <em><strong>Zssues in Medical Ethics</strong></em> for our journal. We shall be implementing this change  from Volume 4 starting January 1996.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based  on the feedback received from several subscribers and well-wishers here and  abroad, we are introducing further changes. We are increasing the number of  pages (including the cover) from 24 to 32 per issue. We are also doing our best  to improve the layout with a view to making our pages easier on the eyes. These  changes will increase the cost of production but we are not passing this on to  our subscribers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  continue to look forward to hearing from you. This journal is intended to serve  as a forum for discussion on the ethics of the medical profession. It can  succeed in its mission only if each of you participates in debates and express  your own views, opinions and practices.
				</p>

				<h5>A request</h5>
				<p>
					If your subscription for <em>Medical Ethics</em> ends with this issue, please renew it promptly and let us know  if you have changed your address, giving us your old and current addresses.
