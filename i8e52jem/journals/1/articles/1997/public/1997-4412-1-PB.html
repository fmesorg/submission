				<h4>National Bioethics Conference: participants' comments </h4>
				<p>
					Although ethical issues involved with social science research are so important, most of the research carried out in India has still not come under ethics review. The conference on national bioethics held from 6 to 8 December 2007 in Bangalore addressed a wide range of issues of ethical concerns in both biomedical and social science research.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eminent speakers of the plenary sessions of this conference addressed a variety of ethical concerns of interest both in biomedical and social science. Issues like: ethical perspectives on research in primary health care, socio-economic dimensions of health care technologies, research in medical surgical devices, ethical challenges in genetic and stem cell research, research on reproductive and contraceptive technologies, ethical challenges faced by clinical organisations in clinical trial and so on were in focus. The plenary sessions on both days were equally stimulating, and I as a demographer have gained a lot from these.
				</p>
				<p>
					A number of other sessions were also held parallel on all days of this conference, allowing participants to choose and attend those of their interest. A wide range of issues were covered during the three days of deliberations, and the discussions would be of immense benefit to any person with an interest in biomedical or social science research. Over the three days I was able to attend a variety of sessions that primarily addressed various ethical concerns in social science research, law and ethics, role of information technology and media, health care technologies and women, and women and health. All these sessions were lively and informative. I also greatly appreciate the moderators who had good command over the subject discussed, and their ability to organise the discussions scientifically and stay focused.
				</p>
				<p>
					That both the scientific and organisational aspects of the conference were properly aligned is a noteworthy achievement. The sessions were well organised and the effective audiovisual system enhanced the quality of presentation. By and large most of the sessions adhered to the timings laid down, which is mostly not the case in many conferences of this nature. Overall, I have been able to benefit from participating in this three-day conference.
