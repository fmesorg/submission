					The  concept of property is usually understood as a moral and legal right to  exercise exclusive influence and control over a material object <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Blackstone W. Commentaries on the laws of England. In: Ellickson RC, Rose CM, Ackerman BA, editors. Perspectives on property law. 2nd ed. New York: Little, Brown and Company, 1995:38." id="1">(1)</a>. A person  who owns something, such as a patent or medicine, can dispose of (or control  access to) it without regard for others. Like and including patents, most  property in a modern capitalist economy is intangible <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Grey T. The disintegration of property. In: Pennock JR, Chapman JW, editors. Property. New York: New York University Press; 1980, 69-85." id="2">(2)</a>. For example,  pharmaceutical companies do not merely own the medicine they produce, but (in  many cases) they also 'own' the intangible molecular-biological formulation of  the medicine. They own the medicine's 'blueprint' and thus can prevent others  from producing the same or similar medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite  this conceptualisation of property, ideas easily can be considered a 'public  good' in the sense that sharing an idea is relatively costless and can be as  easy as exchanging a sheet of paper. Ideas do not easily exhaust themselves  with use; more is always better. Rather than having one drug company in  Switzerland or in the United States producing AIDS medication, as we do under  our contemporary property model, we could have factories throughout the world  producing medicines that are patented by companies in the wealthy  industrialised nations. Such regional manufacturing would be particularly  effective in places such as Africa, Asia and India, which are hardest hit by  AIDS and where locally produced medicines could be distributed easily to the  people who need it, particularly to those who live in tribal or village  communities that ordinarily lack access to western-produced goods. If 50 or 100  factories throughout the world were to produce the medicine, as opposed to two,  the nature and effectiveness of the medicine would remain unaltered.
				</p>
				<p>
					What  would change, however, is profitability. As private social goods become public,  the ability of individuals to gorge themselves on public misfortune (or  collective inaction) is lessened. Medicine does not have value outside its  use-the existence of medicine implies its utilisation. In other words, medicine  is the antithesis of symbolic exchange. To commodify medicine as capital-to  exchange it in the open market-is to invalidate its function as medicine at the  expense of its human ends and the good of the community. Society ceases to  function ethically when life-saving medicine is withheld from afflicted people  to benefit the minority over the majority.
				</p>
				<p>
					Practically  speaking, to suggest public access to AIDS medicine goes against important  individual rights that are privileged within the private property regime. Given  this tension, the private property regime can reasonably be made to yield, and  we may come to consider it a crime against humanity to sacrifice the common good  to protect an individual's wealth. Those who possess wealth should be  considered obligated to hold that wealth in trust for humanity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Simply,  morality now must be considered part of the cost of doing business. After the  collapse of Enron and other major US corporations in 2001-02, this argument is  becoming much more culturally salient. But even before recent events returned  the issue of corporate responsibility to the forefront of the world's  consciousness, commentators supported this idea. As articulated by John J  Maresca <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Maresca JJ. A new concept of business. The Washington Quarterly 2000 Spring: 161." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Friedman M. The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits. The New York Times Magazine 1970 Sep 13: 32-3, 122-5." id="4">4)</a>:

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						[T]oday a business can  no longer be seen as a creator of wealth solely for its owners. The role of  business as a creator of wealth is broader than that. Business is the principal  engine for generating wealth for society as a whole. And business is the  producer of new and beneficial products, which increasingly must be safe,  environmentally harmless, and give long term benefits.
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In  other words, the world of business must increasingly be viewed as a world where  human creative energy produces the conditions of life in new and creative ways.  As such, business has an important public role to play in the development of  society-it must serve to the best of its ability; this and not profit per se is  the reason for its existence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Related  to exclusivity is the notion that owners have the power to alienate their  rights and control over a resource on whatever terms they alone consider  appropriate. For example, a property owner is free to trade on terms that are  most favourable to the owner, without regard to non-market possible  implications of the owner's actions, relative to health, peace or world  stability. Exclusivity and alienation mean that property must be free to shift  from what law and economics theorists consider to be 'less productive to more  productive use through a voluntary exchange' <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Posner R. Economic analysis of law. New York: Little, Brown and Company; 1973:14." id="5">(5)</a>. The assumption is that the  person who most highly values a good is willing to pay the most money for it.  Yet this assumes, quite erroneously, that the value of money is constant, that  a hundred dollars to someone who is poor is the same as to someone who is rich.  In reality, the value of money often relates to the amount of wealth one  possesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similarly,  there are many situations in which people value something highly, such as their  health, but cannot pay the 'premium' that is expected for it by market logic.  More specifically, some objects exist that cannot be reconciled easily with the  notion that goods should be sold to the person who is willing to pay the  highest price-there are values that society recognises as important that the  market does not easily reflect. These things we either take out of the market  entirely or make an exception to asserted principles of so called 'economic  effectiveness'. AIDS medicine (and ultimately, other types of medicine) should  fall into this category.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  idea that certain objects are unfit for market exchange is known as 'market  inalienability'. As Margaret Jane Radin explains, 'Society values certain  things that cannot or should not be sold for a price. People, body parts, sex,  and children are typical examples. While many people feel very uncomfortable  (or should feel uncomfortable) selling people, body parts, sex, or children,  society does not have any issue with giving away these things for free under  certain circumstances.' The point of market inalienability is that, as a  society, we value the non-commodification of some items, rendering those things  non-saleable. Rather, we perceive the item as a personal human good or resource  to which a monetary value cannot be assigned. To identify something as  invaluable is to say that it should not be corrupted by market processes. When  we talk about market inalienability, then we often justify our departure from  market norms by using the term integrity. Some things, such as those stated  above, that otherwise we could commodify and sell in an impersonal market to  the highest bidder, have a normative value that supersedes the normal  rationales of the market. To place them in the market is considered repulsive  and prohibited in civilised society.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  highlighting the term "integrity", we try to affirm ourselves as  people with identities and authentic needs. In doing so, we reject our false  identities as faceless consumers whose only worth to the producer is the power  of our pocketbook. When we consider the concept of integrity, we acknowledge  that normal market practice can be dehumanising and oppressive, particularly  for lower income people. We also realise that normal market practice is  positively unconscionable when the people objectified as consumers are those  AIDS victims who cannot pay for a life-extending, suffering-reducing medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Market  inalienability recognises that some people do not have deep pocketbooks; thus,  they do not have a market personality. Still, poor people remain human beings  and we protect them by prohibiting them from selling their bodies, organs, or  children. In much of the developing world, however, extreme poverty forces many  people to do just this <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hansen B. Global black market preys on poor donors. CQ Researcher 13. 2003 Feb 21: 158-9." id="6">(6)</a>. As Ulla Fasting, Jan Christensen, and Susanne  Glending note, 'It is well known and widely publicised that many poor people  living in India have sold one of their kidneys, or one of their eyes, for a sum  of money that would enable them to cover the basic needs of their family for a  period of time ... This was going on in an open market, also refereed to as  "India's kidney bazaar" <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fasting U, Christensen J, Glending S. Children sold for transplants: Medical and legal aspects. Nursing Ethics 1998 Nov 5: 519." id="17">(7)</a>.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Few  people disagree with the paternalistic protection of prohibiting people from  selling their body parts. Some things must be given away. To repress knowledge  of medicine that can reduce the spread of AIDS (as in the simple and  inexpensive procedure that protects children from inheriting AIDS from their  mothers during childbirth) or to fail to reduce the suffering of people  afflicted with AIDS on the grounds that one person 'owns' the medicine and  another has no right to it without payment of a premium is so completely  reprehensible that it should be beyond acceptance and legal protection in  civilised society. The fact that many in the international community tolerate  this system is a sign that we have much moral growth to accomplish as a global  community.
