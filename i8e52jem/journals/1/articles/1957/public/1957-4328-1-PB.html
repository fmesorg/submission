				<h4>Irrational X-ray  tests</h4>
				<p>
					Most companies, while recruiting employees, conduct x-ray tests as a regular  protocol of health assessment of applicants. This is performed regardless of an  identical recent x-ray examination of an individual and without checking  previous records. A person changing jobs is thus exposed to frequent ionising  radiation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The personnel department also refuses to pass  on the data on his health to the individual. Since earlier x-ray films are not  available to the next agencyrepeat exposure to x-rays becomes inevitable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient is told that the x-ray test  involves 'a small risk'. Should this justify repeated, routine x-irration of  that person? Shouldn't clinical examination be a guideline to prescribing the  test?
				</p>
				<p>
					Is the medical profession over-using this  helpful but hazardous test? This is a question of great relevance to young  persons who constantly seek better prospects.
