					Thank you for the newsletter Medical Ethics. It is a sad state of affairs when the practice of  medicine demands the necessity of such a newsletter or journal as in other  countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics, whether medical  or otherwise, are inborn and should come naturally. Does a person have to  observe a moral code just because there is a law concerning it which should not  be broken? Under the present circumstances will a newsletter like this have any  effect on the profession at large? The persons who read such a newsletter will  be those who believe in medical ethics and wish to improve themselves. What  about those who should change their ways and attitudes? Will they even glance  through the newsletter or will they throw it into the waste paper basket? Take  the article on elections to the MMC? Will those on board pay heed to the  warnings given or will they try newer unethical ways and means to secure their  seats?
				</p>
				<p>
					Even so, such a  newsletter is necessary because unless one makes the voice of sanity heard  there is no hope of improvement and a bad situation continues or gets worse.  Apart from medical politics and the attitude of medical practitioners towards  one another and toward their patients, there are many other aspects which  require elucidation and discussion. What may have been right and correct in one  period may not necessarily be right and correct in another. Abortion and  euthanasia are two examples. I am sure the newsletter will prove a source of  light to those who grope in the dark as to the proper action when they face a  problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					May I suggest that you  ask two experts in the field to present opposing viewpoints on controversial  subjects?
				</p>
				<p>
					As regards the situation  of MOTHER vs FETUS, in my opinion the line of action followed by the doctors  was absolutely correct. The prime factor in any situation is the intention of  the doctor in charge of the case. If this is honest and sincere and based on  sound reasoning, no fault can be attributed to him for he has acted in the best  interests of both mother and fetus. What guarantee is there that a caesarian  operation performed whilst the mother was alive would have resulted in a normal  fetus? Such an operation would certainly have jeopardised the life of the  mother.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wish the newsletter  every success.
