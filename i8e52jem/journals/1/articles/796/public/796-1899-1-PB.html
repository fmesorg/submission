					Indian  women face covert violence before birth through sex pre-selection, and overt  violence after conception through sex-selective abortion. While abortion is  legal in India, sex-selective abortion is not. Amniocentesis, chorionic villus  biopsy (CVB), sonography, ultrasound and imaging techniques are used to  determine the sex of the foetus <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patel V. Girl child: an endangered species? In: Kripal V(ed). The girl child in 20th century Indian literature. New Delhi: Sterling Publications, 1992;9." id="1">(1)</a>. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) clinics for  assisted reproduction are approached by infertile couples to produce sons. This  has resulted in a decline in the juvenile sex ratio and 60 lakh missing girls  in the age group of 0-6 years, as per the Census of India, 2001.

				<h4>New  reproductive technologies (NRTs) and women</h4>
				<p>
					NRTs refer to four types of functions: IVF and subsequent embryo transfer,  gamete intrafallopian transfer, zygote intra fallopian transfer, and cloning  assisted repro-duction. While the new contraceptive technologies are used  before conception, older methods such as amniocentesis, CVB and ultrasound are  used after conception.
				</p>
				<p>
					Supporters of sex-selection tests for elimination of female foetuses have  justified their views on the basis of the law of supply and demand. However,  there has been a continuous decline in the sex ratio from 972 women per 1000  men in 1901 to 933 women per 1000 men in 2001. In other countries, sex ratios  at birth are also skewed in favour of men.

				<h4>States  with widespread use of sex-selection tests</h4>
				<p>
					Haryana  has the most depressing figures&mdash;the current sex ratio in Haryana is 861 females  per 1000 males, the lowest among the major states in India. According to a  UNFPA study, female foeticide has been the main cause of the declining sex  ratio in Haryana. A study conducted in states known for high rates of  abortion&mdash;Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab,  Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh&mdash;revealed the impact of sex-selective  abortion in widening the gender gap. Interestingly, Punjab and Haryana are two  of the most economically prosperous states in India.

				<h4>Initiatives taken by the  State and NGOs:</h4>
				<p>
					In response to a public interest petition, the Supreme Court of India gave a  directive on May 4, 2001 to all state governments to implement the Prenatal  Diagnostics Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act promptly and  effectively (enacted in 1994 and brought into operation from January 1, 1996).  According to this directive, all bodies under the PNDT Act, namely genetic  counselling centres, genetic laboratories and genetic clinics, cannot function  unless registered <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Handbook on PNDT Act, 1994. Department of Family Welfare, Government of India, New Delhi, 2002" id="2">(2)</a>. The Prenatal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex  Selection) Act, 2003 specifically prohibits the use of new technology for the  purpose of sex selection (4). The Municipal Corporation of Mumbai has initiated  a drive against unauthorised determination of the sex of the foetus. All  sonography centres are required to register themselves with the appropriate  authority and must display a message that under no circumstances will the sex  of the foetus be disclosed. The Indian Medical Association and the Federation  of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India too have condemned  sex-selective abortions and abuse of NRTs for sex selection.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have to change the mindset of doctors and their clients and create a  sociocultural milieu that is conducive for survival of the girl child. Then  only will we be able to halt the declining sex ratio.
