				<h4>International research ethics : some issues</h4>
				<p>
					What  are the odds of a poor Guatemalan getting entry into a trial for the latest  AIDS drug cocktail - and of continuing those drugs once the trial is over? Can  a placebo control be used where the local standard of care does not include a  proven treatment? Does the answer differ depending on whether the study is  collaborative or locally funded?
				</p>
				<p>
					This article identifies and discusses some ethical issues in international  research. Research collaboration with developing countries is plagued by  differing interpretations of ethical standards and by inequitable funding. Only  10 per cent of global research funding goes to diseases comprising 90 per cent  of the global burden. Collaborative research can exacerbate the poor state of  local research environments by diverting local scientific expertise from more  important to less important areas of research, and neglecting national research  networks.
				</p>
				<p>
					The awareness that the success of research collaboration should not be judged  solely on the results of scientific research activities must be coupled with a  learning approach to craft a sustainable, mutually beneficial working  relationship that, aside from advancing science, must address inequity and put  local priorities first, develop capacity with a long term perspective, and  preserve the dignity of the local people by ensuring that the benefits of  research will truly uplift their status.

				<h4>Revising  the Declaration of Helsinki : one opinion</h4>
				<p>
					Should  the control group of a research study in a poor country receive the best  possible treatment or the standard of care - which might be nothing at all? Two  articles in the New England Journal of Medicine debate the question. The first  author states that the proposed revisions of the Declaration of Helsinki may  "inappropriately cause a shift to an efficiency-based standard for  research involving human subjects and weaken the principles of the investigator's  moral commitment to the research subject and the just allocation of the  benefits and burdens of research. The revisions will also logically lead to an  explosion of research in developing countries that would be intended mainly to  benefit developed countries &mdash; another affront to current notions of ethical  research."
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposed changes are subtle. They would allow a waiver of written informed  consent if the ethics committee determined that the risks posed by the research  are slight or if the procedures to be used in the research are customarily used  in medical practice without informed consent. It does not insist on consent  being obtained by a physician who has no conflicts of interest. And it will  permit the control group to receive "the local standard of care",  which could be no care at all. Finally, it dilutes the prohibition against  publishing unethical research.

				<h4>..and another opinion</h4>
				<p>
					The second author argues that the Declaration of Helsinki makes a  spurious distinction between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research,  resulting in errors not intended by the authors. Second, it includes several  provisions out of touch with contemporary ethical thinking. As a consequence,  many researchers routinely violate its requirements. Such routine violations  and their associated attitudes rob the
				</p>
				<p>
					declaration of its credibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, insistence on active controls would increase expense, decrease  efficiency and actually violate international ethical guidelines which require  that research is responsive to the health needs and the priorities of the  community in which it is carried out. Referring to the placebo-controlled  trials of short-course AZT to prevent maternal-foetal transmission in  developing countries, the author argues that the placebo control meets ethical  requirements: what people in developing countries need to know is whether the  short-course regimen is better or worse than that which is currently  available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Countries which cannot afford all the treatments available to residents of  industrialised nations must be allowed to develop affordable preventive and  curative interventions. Research sponsors in industrialised countries should not  be prevented from assisting developing countries in their efforts. The  Declaration of Helsinki should be revised to reflect this understanding.

				<h4>Standards for mandatory programmes</h4>
				<p>
					Mandatory  public health programmes are justified in limiting the rights of individuals  because they benefit the community as a whole. The authors suggest that any  mandatory programme should meet certain requirements: failure to implement it  would negatively affect the rights of others it is the least restrictive  feasible alternative, and it is fairly and equitably administered. They  evaluate 10 TB programmes in the US using mandatory Directly Observed Therapy  (DOT) to see if they fulfilled these criteria. Their findings: "DOTS was  not shown to be consistently more effective than ... a high-quality  self-administered treatment program. Within DOT programs, the least restrictive  alternative was not consistently used (as demonstrated by variations in frequency,  duration, and location of treatment), nor was DOT always applied  equitably."

				<h4>Conflict of interest: some findings </h4>
				<p>
				In an  editorial in the issue of <em>BMJ</em> containing a collection of material on conflict  of interest, the author notes the accumulation of evidence that financial  benefit makes doctors more likely to refer patients for tests, operations, or  hospital admission, or to ask that drugs be stocked by a hospital pharmacy.  Reviews acknowledging sponsorship by the pharmaceutical or tobacco industry are  more likely to draw conclusions favourable to the industry. </p>
				<p>
					The author refers to two significant papers documenting the consequences of  conflict of interest. A study of 70 journal articles on calcium channel  antagonists for treating cardiovascular disorders showed that authors were more  likely to support the drug if they had a financial relationship with a  manufacturer. Two thirds of the authors had financial relationships with  manufacturers, but "only two of the 70 articles ... disclosed the authors'  potential conflicts of interest." As many as 96% of the supportive authors  had financial relationships with manufacturers, compared with 60% of neutral  authors and 37% of critical authors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, of 106 review articles on passive smoking looking at characteristics  determining their conclusions, 37% concluded that passive smoking was not  harmful and the rest that it was. A multiple regression analysis controlling  for article quality, peer review status, article topic, and year of publication  found that the only factor associated with the review's conclusion was whether  the author was affiliated with the tobacco industry. Only 23% disclosed the  sources of funding for research.

				<h4>Medicine  and human rights</h4>
				<p>
				1999  marks the 50th anniversary of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the 100th  anniversary of the Hague Convention, and follows by one year the 50th  anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These anniversaries  offer the <em>BMJ</em> the opportunity to explore a number of ethical and policy  dilemmas that face medicine and science when issues of moral choice arise in  war and in peace. </p>
				<p>
					Discussions through case example, historical analysis, analysis of clinical  data, or assessment of current and anticipated issues, seek to illuminate the  relevance of key points in international humanitarian law and human rights to  those whose work is guided by the more familiar principles of medical and  research ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is hoped that readers deliberating on these questions of medicine, moral  choice, and international law will appreciate that in the sphere of  international humanitarian law and human rights there is not only room for the  moral voice of physicians but an outright imperative that it should be heard.

				<h4>Applying guidelines rationing health care</h4>
				<p>
					In  1997, a 63-year-old Maori man with moderate dementia was taken off dialysis for  end stage renal disease, applying a New Zealand health service guideline that  'moderate to severe dementia' is a factor 'likely to determine that an  individual is not suitable for treatment.' since there must be ability to  co-operate with active treatment.' He died after an unsuccessful effort to get  the Human Rights Commission to review the decision. The commission ruled that  the guidelines were legitimate and used correctly. The case has been described  as "discrimination leading to death." This essay notes that the  questions raised by this decision are central to the concerns of people with  disabilities: "It would be thought unacceptable to withhold dialysis from  patient who are blind or have an intellectual disability, yet the rationale  underpinning the 'mental function' guideline applied to Mr Williams - 'there  must be ability to comply with active treatment' - could also be applied to  such patients."

				<h4>Defining limits</h4>
				<p>
					What  does the researcher do when the group that s/he wishes to study is incapable of  giving informed consent? Not doing research would deny that particular part of  the population the benefits of research-dependent care. The author discusses  the limits to research and therapeutic intervention on perinatal patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Starting with a discussion on therapeutic innovation, the prelude to systematic  research, he goes on to consider consent in therapeutic and non-therapeutic  research. The problems with accepting parental consent for non-therapeutic  research are pointed out. The author presents guidelines for designing research  involving perinatal subjects: it should be worthwhile and the goals realisable;  and it should involve only "minimal risk to the research subject", a  subject which is defined in some detail.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regarding limits to therapeutic interventions, the decisive factor is the  interest of the patient. However, when a clinician is eager to evaluate a new  technique and a parent is faced with losing a child, the cost to the child in  need may get overlooked. The author concludes by referring to a four-year-old  child who spent "the last months of her life undergoing harrowing heroic  procedures. This raised the question of whether some paediatricians felt there  was no point at which to call a halt to innovative practice."

				<h4>Deaf-mute  or brain dead?</h4>
				<p>
					The  author, a nephrologist, comments on the public response to the report of  Prakash, a mentally disabled deaf-mute man, whose kidney was transplanted into  his brother who had renal failure (see <em>IME</em> VII [2]: 38 VII [3]: 70). The  consent form was signed by the man's mother. The author writes: "Had the  guardian a right to give consent to the surgery? This boy was treated like an  animal, not like a human being with some rights. He was subjected to the risk  of death, albeit very small, and to considerable pain..." Some letter  writers made surprising observations. One wrote that the transplant would  "fill the hollowness in (Prakash's) heart and unknowingly or knowingly add  a new meaning to his silent existence." Another, the president of the Indian  Society of Organ Transplantation, declared that Prakash was "suffering  from brain death due to loss of his higher sensory faculties " and in any  case, if he were a "sane man, (he) would have been most happy to donate a  kidney to his own brother." The author notes, "Almost half the  perfectly sane, prospective, related donors decide that they do not wish to  donate a kidney to their brother or sister, son or daughter. ...If we throw  ethics to the wind, where will it end? Our mental health institutions are full  of mentally incompetent people. Why not take their kidneys, and maybe lungs,  hearts and liver as well, and thereby give some meaning to their lives?"

				<h4>Love and medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The March 1999 issue of  the Eubios journal contains papers from one of the sessions at the TRT4 in  October 1998, looking at bioethics and the love of life. A number of the  articles discuss the relation of love and medical ethics: as a general concept  as well as in specific cultures such as the Philippines, south Asia, India,  Iran, Thailand and China. Of the many valuable essays, one of them is  particularly useful. The author discusses the question of bioethics and the  love of life through the five central questions for bioethical theories: the  meta-ethic, the normative questions of what is value, what is virtue, what are  the principles of right conduct; and the relation between principles and  causes.
