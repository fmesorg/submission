					The  experiences of countries across the world have demonstrated the need for  government involvement in health care <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dreze J, Sen A. India: Development and participation. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002." id="1">(1)</a>. Due to the poor quality of India's  government health care system, diseases that have declined in many developing  countries continue to be common here. Studies indicate that government spending  on health care has decreased from 25% to 17% of the country's total health  expenditure (both public and private) between 1991 and 2001 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India.

				<h4>Inefficiency  of government services</h4>
				<p>
					The low level of public spending is compounded by inefficient use of the  available resources and inequalities in access to health care based on region,  class, caste and gender <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dreze J, Sen A. India: Development and participation.

Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-07. New Delhi: Indian Planning Commission, 2002." id="2">2)</a>. A recent study of public hospitals in  Kerala&mdash;one of the better performing states in the country&mdash;found that 60% of  land, 50% of building space and 25% of the beds remained unutilised <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Varatharajan D, Sadanandan R, Thankappan KR, Mohanan Nair V.

Thiruvananthapuram: Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies, 2002." id="9">(9)</a>. Twenty  eight per cent of the hospitals reported less than 25% utilisation of their  facilities. Most people are dissatisfied with the staff in public services <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paul S, Balakrishnan S, Gopakumar K, Sekhar S, Vivekananda M. State of India's public services: benchmarks for the states. Economic and Political Weekly 2004; 39:920-33." id="10">(10)</a>.  Further, absenteeism among doctors and other public health staff is as high as  67% in some states <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Bank. World Development Report 2004: making services work for poor people. Washington, DC: The World Bank, 2003." id="11">(11)</a>. In some states, the poor are more likely to borrow  money when hospitalised in the public sector than in the private sector <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. World Health Report 2000-Health systems: Improving performance. Geneva: WHO, 2000." id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					People  express their dissatisfaction by not using government facilities. The  government sector meets the demands of only 18% of outpatient and 40% of  inpatient care <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-07. New Delhi: Indian Planning Commission, 2002." id="2">(2)</a>. Even for those living below the poverty line, the private  sector accounts for 10% of children immunised, 25% of antenatal care visits,  30% of institutional deliveries and 40% of hospital days.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today,  the very existence of the government health sector is questioned. Increasing  input costs, poor absorption of technology by the government sector and the  mushrooming of private health care institutions do not help.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Government's  failure is private sector's success</h4>
				<p>
					The shrinking government sector is accompanied by the growth and expansion of  the for-profit, non-governmental sector, encouraged by tax concessions, duty  exemptions, and allocation of government land <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Narayana KV. Changing health care system. Economic and Political Weekly 2003;38:1230-41." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumar G. Promoting public-private partnership in health services. Economic and Political Weekly 2003; 38:3041-5." id="12">12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the  time of Independence, the for-profit sector had a 5%-10% share of the total  patient care. Today, it accounts for 82% of outpatient visits, 58% of  hospitalisation days, 40% of institutional deliveries, 35% of antenatal care  visits, and 15% of children immunised <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-07. New Delhi: Indian Planning Commission, 2002." id="2">(2)</a>. The private sector's success is  attributable less to its own efficiency and more to the government's failure <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chirmulay D, Gupte A. Factors affecting health seeking and utilisation of curative health care. Pune: BAIF Development and Research Foundation, 1997." id="13">(13</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kunhikannan TP, Aravindan KP.

				</p>
				<p>
					At the  same time, the growing for-profit private sector, technological innovations and  higher awareness levels are some factors responsible for health care costs  increasing many times more than general inflation.
				</p>

				<h4>Economics  and ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Economics is 'the study of how societies use scarce resources to produce valuable  commodities and distribute them among different people' <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Samuelson PA, Nordaus WD. Economics. New York: McGraw-Hill Inc., 1995:4." id="15">(15)</a>. This means that  if society has to optimally allocate 'finite resources' to satisfy 'infinite  wants', it must make efficient use of its limited resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the  government health care system, efficiency could mean the ideal hospital which  is solvent and promotes public health. Alternatively, it could refer to a  'social optimum'&mdash; maximising the welfare of the 'whole patient', and not just  providing medical care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics  is concerned with the intrinsic importance of many considerations. Of the  principles of ethical reasoning, distributive justice is perhaps the most  applicable in a discussion of ethics and economics. The ethical view of  economic achievement would be to attain wealth not just for one person but for  the entire community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is it  ethical to apply economic principles to assess the performance of government  health care provision? One instinctive response is that doing so might deny  medical attention to a section of the population. Running a health care system  on the basis of efficiency alone may not necessarily meet the needs of the  population it is meant to serve. It may, therefore, be seen as unethical to  talk of 'efficiency' in government health care provision. On the other hand, it  can be argued that the poor are the most affected when the government health  care system ignores economic principles.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  analysing the performance of the government sector per se in India, one finds  that those sub-sectors serving the advantaged get sufficient resources. Sectors  such as health exclude advantaged populations because of their inefficient  functioning and, therefore, do not form a part of any policy debate. Health is  given low priority during the resource allocation process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Efficient  functioning of government health care institutions should make this sector more  competitive and thereby reduce the cost of care in the private sector. At  present, the poor are often forced to use the private sector, where health care  costs are high. Many go into debt or are denied care because they cannot pay <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kunhikannan TP, Aravindan KP. Changes in the health status of Kerala: 1987-1997. Thiruvananthapuram: Centre for Development Studies, 2000. Discussion Paper No. 20:26-36." id="14">(14)</a>. The poor spend 40% of their income on health care while the rich spend  just 2.4%. Surely this is an injustice.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  long run, if government health care institutions do not improve, they may be  termed 'sick' and will have to close down. Those most affected will be the poor  and disadvantaged who use government facilities the most <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Tenth Five Year Plan 2002-07. New Delhi: Indian Planning Commission, 2002." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Krishnan TN. Access to health and the burden of treatment in India: An inter-state comparison. In: Rao M (ed). Disinvesting in health: The World Bank's prescriptions for health. New Delhi: Sage Publications, 1999:208-32." id="3">3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus,  it may be ethical to apply efficiency principles to the government health care  system. This will also require increasing resources in this sector.  Unfortunately, even the latest Union health budget failed to considerably  enhance resources in health <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Union budget 2004-05. New Delhi: Ministry of Finance, 2004. Available from URL: http://www.indiabudget.nic.in (accessed on September 22, 2004)." id="16">(16)</a>. The overall allocation to health is 2.1% of  the total budget or about 0.3% of GDP. It falls short of the 0.5% of GDP  mandated by the National Health Policy (it requires the government to  spend 2% of GDP on health of which 25% should come from the central government <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. National Health Policy 2002. New Delhi: Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2002." id="6">(6)</a>.

				<h4>Efforts  to increase the efficiency of the government health sector</h4>
				<p>
					Since the mid-1990s, international agencies have funded health sector reforms  in many states of India. A National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health was  formed recently. States have implemented various measures including mapping  health care provision and utilisation, public-private partnerships, user fees,  insurance, community financing, voluntary retirement of government staff,  preparation of citizen charters for government facilities, creation of  autonomous corporations to improve efficiency of services, and local  self-government control of government health care institutions. These are  efforts to improve efficiency in the health care system. Their effectiveness is  yet to be judged, and there may be further questions on whether some changes pose  ethical problems in themselves.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The government's failure to get 'value for money' affects, albeit unequally,  both users and non-users of government health care facilities. Users are  affected because they get poor care or none at all; non-users are affected  because inefficient government facilities increase the costs of private care.  Corrective measures would promote distributive justice. The poor and  disadvantaged, who bear a higher share of the disease burden and receive a  smaller share of public money because of inefficiency, would be the ultimate  beneficiaries.
