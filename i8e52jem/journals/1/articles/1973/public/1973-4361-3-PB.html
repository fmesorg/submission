				<h4>International Conference on Human rights, Bioethics and Health</h4>
				<p>
					11-l 3 September 1997, Paris, France.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although broadly considered to be a fundamental human right, access to health care still raises many issues, notably as regards its implementation in practice. On the one hand the number of persons deprived of social protection is increasing, even in the industrialised countries. On the other hand, the emerging new biomedical technologies are influencing the control of vital human functions (notably in the fields of procreation, genetics and neuroscicnces). This has resulted in a challenge to human rights, encapsulated in the formula - 'Towards grcatcr freedom, OR, towards the acceptance of greater risks'.
