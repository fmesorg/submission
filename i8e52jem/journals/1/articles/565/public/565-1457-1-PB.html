				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Background:</strong> This study aimed to provide an understanding of  the relationship between the ethical climate at the workplace and job  satisfaction among nurses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Methods:</strong> 210 nurses working in selected wards in the Tehran University of  Medical Sciences were asked to fill out questionnaires on their work  environment and level of job satisfaction. The data collection tools included a  questionnaire to obtain demographic data, the Olson moral climate questionnaire  and Minnesota job satisfaction questionnaire. The data were analysed using SPSS  software version 14.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Results:</strong> We found a significant positive relationship between the ethical climate and  the level of job satisfaction among the nurses. Among the demographic  variables, the working shift, income level and type of duties allocated had a  significant relationship with job satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Hospital managements should pay attention to the factors influencing  job motivation among nurses, including the ethical climate of the work  environment.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Organisations are units of the community that both  affect the environment and are affected by it. Organisational ethics is a set  of principles that promotes similar behaviours among the organisation's staff,  and helps the organisation and staff solve problems caused by conflicts within  the system, such as personal tensions and disputes related to job  responsibilities <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joolaee S, Jalili HR, Rafii F, Hajibabaee F, Haghani H.

					The ethical climate in healthcare settings is defined  as "organizational specific conditions that facilitate the discussion on the  patients' health problems and their solutions, and provide a framework for  ethical decision-making in the clinical environment." Researchers have  suggested that the promotion of an ethical climate in the workplace enables  employees to better cope with ethical stress and other causes of  dissatisfaction, and may increase their level of job satisfaction <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fogel KM.

				<p>
					Employees'  job satisfaction has been shown to be reflected in their attitudes towards  their work. Those who are satisfied with their work have a positive attitude  towards it, while those who are dissatisfied have a negative attitude <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Robins A.

A  positive ethical climate is also associated with high levels of job  satisfaction in terms of attitudes to payment, professional progress and  colleagues.

				<p>
					This  study aimed to determine the relationship between the ethical climate at work  and job satisfaction among nurses in a university hospital in Tehran.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<h5>Population and sample</h5>
				<p>
					The  study sample consisted of 210 nurses working in the emergency, surgery and  internal medicine wards, and the cardiac care units (CCUs) and intensive care  units (ICUs) of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). All were  graduates with either BSc or MSc degrees in nursing.
				</p>
				<h5>Sampling technique</h5>
				<p>
					The study used stratified sampling with proportional  allocation. The wards were selected according to the number of nurses working  there. The sample from each ward was selected randomly (using the lists of  nurses working there).
				</p>
				<h5>Instruments</h5>
				<p>
					A  demographic form, the Olson moral climate questionnaire <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Olson LL. Ethical climate as the context for nursing retention. J Illinois Nurs. 2002;99 (6):3-7." id="15">(15)</a> and the Minnesota  job satisfaction questionnaire <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ben-Bakr KA, Al-Shammari IS, Jefri OA. Organizational commitment, satisfaction, and turnover in Saudi organizations: a predictive study. JSocio-Economics. 1994; 23(4): 449-56." id="16">(16)</a> were used to gather data. The moral climate  is taken to reflect the ethical climate in professional settings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  demographic form included questions on age, gender, education, type of  employment, level of income, marital status and the current ward assigned.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Olson moral climate questionnaire, which uses a Likert scale, contains 26 items  on the organisation's moral climate. Each question has five options: "almost  never" (score=1), "rarely" (score=2), "sometimes" (score=3), "often" (score=4)  and "almost always" (score=5). The questions concern five factors, including  "communicating level with the colleagues" (items 1, 10, 18 and 23), "patients"  (items 2, 6, 11 and 19), "managers" (items 3, 7, 12, 15, 20, 24), "physicians"  (items 5, 9, 14, 17, 22 and 26) and "hospital" (items 4, 8, 13,16, 21 and 25).  The higher the score, the more positive was the moral climate at work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Minnesota job satisfaction questionnaire, which also uses  a Likert scale, contains 23 questions on the participants' working conditions.  Each question has five options: "very satisfied" (score=5), "satisfied"  (score=4), "do not know" (score=3), "dissatisfied" (score=2) and "very  dissatisfied" (score=1). The higher the score, the higher is the level of job  satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  questionnaires were designed after a review of the literature, in consultation  with colleagues and experts in the field.
				</p>
				<h5>Ethics review</h5>
				<p>
					The  research proposal was approved by the ethics committee of the Tehran University  of Medical Sciences and permission for the study obtained from the School  Research Committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Data collection and analysis</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The  researcher handed the questionnaires to the unit heads, who distributed them  among the nurses in their units. The participants were provided with  information on the goals of the study and assured of the confidentiality of the  personal information they would be providing.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  data were analysed using the statistical programme SPSS version 14.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					90%  of the respondents were women. The respondents' ages ranged from 22 to 55  years, the average age being 30.8. 61% were below 31 years of age. 207 (98.6%) had a bachelor's degree and 3 (1.4  %) had a master's degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of  the 210 nurses, 28.1% worked in the ICU, 26.2% in the surgery ward, 23.3% in  the internal medicine ward, 11.9% in the CCU and 10.5% in the emergency ward. Table 1 shows the frequency distribution of the  demographic characteristics of the nurses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of  the 210 nurses, 58.1% described their income as "average", 34.8% as  "unfavourable" and 5.7% as "favourable". There are 3 missing values (1.4%).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  mean and standard deviation of the Olson moral climate questionnaire results  for the investigated units was 3.36&plusmn;0.69, and the mean and standard deviation  of job satisfaction among the nurses was 3.17&plusmn;0.63.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pearson's correlation co-efficient showed a significant positive correlation between the  moral climate at work and job satisfaction among the nurses (r=0.39, p&le;0.001)  (Table 5).
				</p>
				<p>
					The Scheffe  test did not show any association between job satisfaction among the nurses and  working shift (p=0.02) (Table 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) showed a significant positive  association between income level (p&lt;0.001) and job satisfaction among the  nurses (Table 3).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Scheffe test showed a significant association between job satisfaction and the  type of duties allocated (p=0.02) (Table 4).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					The study  found that the more favourable the ethical climate, the higher the level of job  satisfaction reported by the nurses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Considering  the relationship between the ethical climate at work and job attrition, Hart  found a significant relationship between a poor ethical climate and job attrition.  Factors such as the number of patients, the adequacy of the nursing staff, and  supervision of nursing activities also influenced change of job or career <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hart SE. Hospital ethical climates and registered nurses' turnover intentions. J Nurs Scholarsh. 2005;37(2):173-7." id="17">(17)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to El&#199;i and Alpken, the pursuit of self-interest by employees has a negative  influence on work satisfaction, whereas working with the team's interest in  mind, social responsibility, and professional codes have been found to have a  positive impact <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="El&ccedil;i M, Alpkan L. The impact of perceived  organizational ethical climate on work satisfaction<em>.  J Bus Ethics</em>. 2009;84:297-311." id="18">(18)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  study by Jaramillo et al found that the ethical climate has a positive effect  on a salesperson's satisfaction, which, in turn, leads to a lower employee  turnover, greater organisational commitment, and better job performance <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jaramillo F, Mulki JP, Solomon P. The role of ethical climate on salesperson's role stress, job attitudes, turnover intention, and job performance. J PersSelling Sales Manage. 2006 Summer; 26(3):271-82." id="19">(19)</a>.  Olson considers the ethical climate an organisational variable which can be  managed and modified in order to improve the work environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethical climate provides a basis for ethical  decision-making in organisations. When healthcare organisations enable their  employees to talk to others about difficult issues, such as those faced by  nurses in the care of patients, and allow them to feel that they can consult  their colleagues, managers or clinicians, they create conditions which promote  ethical thinking, ethical dialogue, hope and problem-solving. The work  environment affects the behaviour and beliefs of the employees; hence, the  work environment must be designed to strengthen relations between nurses and  physicians, and to increase job satisfaction <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Olson LL.

				</p>
				<p>
					Among  the demographic variables, the income level and type of duties allocated to the  nurses had a significant statistical relationship with job satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was a significantly positive association  between the nurses' income level and the level of job satisfaction. This result is consistent with other studies.  Manookyan et al found that nurses' income was directly related to their job  satisfaction <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Manookyan A, Razi P, Monjamed Z, Faghih Zadeh S.

				</p>
				<p>
					As  for the type of work allocation among the nurses, those who worked in a team  had a higher level of job satisfaction than those who worked individually. This  suggests that there is a synergy in team work <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fayaz Bakhsh H. Teamwork [Internet].

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The results of our study indicate that hospital  managements should pay more attention to the factors that motivate nurses and  give them job satisfaction. Valuing the nursing profession, allowing scope for  job diversification, and maintaining a respectful relationship with nurses all  make nursing more productive and provide nurses with opportunities to improve  their performance. The direct relationship between the ethical climate of the  workplace and the job satisfaction of the nurses covered by this study  highlights the necessity of considering measures that might strengthen the  ethical climate. One way of promoting the ethical climate of the nurses'  workplace and increasing their job satisfaction is to establish a code of  nursing ethics, disseminate the provisions of the code, and monitor and  evaluate its implementation.
