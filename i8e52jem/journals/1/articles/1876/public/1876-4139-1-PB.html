					<em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em> is in now in its tenth  year of publication. It has been years of voluntary effort and the commitment  of a few, on a shoestring budget, that have seen the journal through. Bringing  out each issue has been demanding. The editorial board is still voluntary and  there is no full time staff. We still share an administrative office and our  income is mainly from subscriptions. Things haven't got easier over the years.  We have been helped by the occasional grant from an institutional donor.  Overall, it has been an uphill struggle all the way.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wrote to 12 editors in this field around the  world to find out how they survived financially. They are:
					<br />
					Robert Veatch, Director, Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, USA,
					<br />
					Gregory Kaebnick, Editor, <em>Hastings Center Report,</em> USA, <br />
					Bette-Jane Crigger, Editor, <em>IRB: Ethics &amp; Human Research</em> (a Hastings Center  publication), USA, <br />
					Udo Schuklenck, Co-Editor <em>Bioethics and Developing World Bioethics,</em> South  Africa, <br />
					Julian Savulescu, Editor, <em>Journal of Medical Ethics,</em> UK , <br />
					Richard Nicholson, Editor, <em>Bulletin of Medical Ethics,</em> UK, <br />
					Arthur Caplan, Center for Bioethics, University of Pennsylvania, USA,
					<br />
					Leslie LeBlanc Executive Editor, <em>The Journal of Clinical Ethics,</em> USA, <br />
					Darryl Macer, <em>EUBIOS Journal of Asian and International Bioethics,</em> Japan, <br />
					Lynley Anderson, Editor, <em>New Zealand Bioethics Journal,</em> New Zealand, <br />
					Merle Spriggs, Editor, <em>Monash Bioethics Review,</em> Australia, and <br />
				Deborah Zion, Editor, <em>Monash Bioethics Review,</em> Australia. </p>
				<p>
					We asked them questions on the general structure of  funding available to the journal, the nature of academic affiliation, their  attitude towards advertising and raising non-subscription funds, the strategies  they adopted to increase circulation, and how they handled potential conflicts  of interest. On another note, we asked about their experiences and financial  fallouts of putting up journal content on line . A collation of responses of  the nine editors who replied is detailed below.

				<h4>Sources of funding and associated  ethical dilemmas</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<em>Journal subscriptions:</em> These alone accounted for the  major chunk of the income of the medical ethics journals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Contribution and grants:</em> Individuals, private philanthropic organizations  made these contributions along with a limited number of corporations some of  which were health related. Mechanisms suggested to avoid conflict of interest  were:
                        <ol type="a">
                        <li>Editorial staff should not be involved in fund raising;</li>
                        <li>Funders  should not have any control over the content of the publication, and</li>
                        <li>Industry funding should make up only a small portion of overall revenues.</li>
                        </ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Advertising in journals:</em> If journals carry advertising these must not be  allowed to influence editorial decisions. Editors must have full responsibility  for advertising policy and must ensure that existing standards for  advertisements are enforced. Journals should not be dominated by advertising  but editors should be careful about publishing advertisements from only one or  two advertisers.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Funding problems</h4>
				<p>
					The usual sources of funds were subscriptions,  grants (institutional or industry), and advertisements. Resources were usually  available in terms of administrative space and support, and in voluntary work  in peer reviewing articles, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subscriptions alone accounted for the major chunk  of the income of medical ethics journals. <em>The Kennedy Institute of Ethics  journal</em> and <em>The Journal of Clinical Ethics</em> derived all their income from  subscriptions. They did not accept advertising. Gregory Kaebnick writes that  <em>Hastings Center Report</em> does get non-subscription funds: "The shortfall is  managed through unrestricted charitable contributions. Individuals, private  philanthropic foundations, make those contributions, along with a limited  number of corporations, some of which are health-care related. A small  percentage of funders come from industry, and they are periodically lost  because of material published in the journals." This raises important  concerns about conflicts of interest that accompany large contributions or grants.  Each journal's way of coping with this problem is described below.
				</p>
				<p>
				The editorial board of <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em> recently reexamined their own attitudes towards advertising and conflicts of  interest. A pharmaceutical company offered to distribute a CD containing all  volumes of <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em> produced between 1993 and 2000. It would  have the right to distribute the CD to any doctor around the country without  changing its format or jewel case. </p>
				<p>
					Eighteen editorial board members were asked to vote.  Eleven members voted for the offer, four against, one preferred to remain  neutral and two did not vote.
				</p>
				<p>
					An important argument in support of the offer was  that if a product had been produced for sale, and someone wanted to buy it (be  it a pharmaceutical or anyone) and in turn distribute it to a target audience  of physicians, the product could not be withheld, because it was produced to be  sold.
				</p>
				<p>
					The arguments against accepting the offer were: any  association with a pharmaceutical firm amounted to promoting the company as the  latter was piggy-backing on the journal's credibility; it was like taking an  advertisement.
				</p>
				<p>
					This exercise brought to the fore the difficulties  of accepting or denying associations, whether overt or implied. It made us  aware that a pure 'black or white' stand was unacceptable. The most appropriate  ethical stand needed to be defined and periodically redefined together by the  editorial board, readers and publishers.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a similar note, Leslie LeBlanc writes:  "here in the US, there is still discussion regarding who 'owns' medical  ethics, and to align ourselves with one institution rather than another might  constrain us in ways that we don't want."
				</p>

				<h4>Other strategies and resources</h4>
				<p>
					Udo Schuklenk suggests that circulation can be improved  by consciously marketing the journal to western institutional subscribers and  charging them a substantially higher fee. Other suggested strategies are to  sell bulk subscriptions to members of ethics committees, offering a budget  price for subscriptions of large groups, and special issues for special  audiences.
				</p>
				<p>
				At <em>IME,</em> we have tried giving free sample copies for  two or so issues &mdash; in the hope they get converted to paid subscriptions &mdash; with  limited success. </p>
				<p>
					Deborah Zion suggests that if a publisher takes  over the journal, this might provide some funding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lynley Anderson of <em>New Zealand Bioethics Journal</em> says "We are fortunate enough to be based at the University of Otago and  the work of all four members of the editorial board of the Journal is funded by  their departments so that helps keep our costs down." Similarly the  Hastings Center has full-time staff available to work on the journals though  their editorial board members are volunteers.
				</p>

				<h4>About content going online</h4>
				<p>
					There has been a lot of debate on the pros and cons  of making <em>IME's</em> content available free on the Internet. On the upside, this  leads to increased readership, easy searching and retrieval of articles. On the  downside, there are concerns that the online edition could cannibalise the already  small print subscriber base, and fears of copyright violations. We launched our  website on <a href="http://www.medicalethicsindia.org" target="_blank">www.medicalethicsindia.org</a> with hesitation and  caveats. We find these thoughts reflected around the world.
				</p>
				<p>
				One person who is clearly thinking digital is  Darryl Macer of the University of Tsukuba, Japan, who has put all of <em>EJAIB's</em> content on-line and has done so for six years. He admits to losing sales as a  result, but believes that being on-line has the maximum impact on readership. </p>
				<p>
					Lynley Anderson of <em>New Zealand Bioethics Journal</em> plans to put the journal's contents pages and an article index on the web, but  not the articles themselves. To access to the articles, the reader would still  have to subscribe. Gregory E. Kaebnick, of <em>The Hastings Center Report,</em> writes:  "We do not now make the <em>Report</em> available online, but we have been  considering the possibility of going online. If we do, we will either make the  Report available online only some time after the print version is out, or  restrict access to the online <em>Report</em> to subscribers. I am not aware of any  online publication that makes money."
				</p>
				<p>
					Bette-Jane Crigger of the Hastings Center has  similar views: "It's difficult to know whether making full text available  online helps or hurts small publications&mdash;finding data on the question has  proven very difficult. But we are wondering the same thing, since we are  preparing to put both journals of the Hastings Center online over the next two  years or so. One idea we are discussing is to make abstracts freely available,  but restrict access to full text to paying subscribers. We are thinking through  the logistics of just how to do that and what implications it may have for the  hardcopy publications. Now, full text of most articles is available online  through commercial services with which we have contracts. They provide modest  royalties every time an article is downloaded."
				</p>
				<p>
					Leslie LeBlanc of <em>The Journal of Clinical Ethics</em> plans  an interesting variation: "Overseas subscribers would pay a reduced fee  and receive only the password (that is, no paper copies of the journal) for  that fee, saving shipping time and shipping costs. This way, we would be making  our journal more available to those overseas who might not otherwise be able to  afford it, either because of limited budgets (in third-world countries) or  because the added shipping costs make the price hard to justify."
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, she has articulated some peculiar ethical  problems with the internet: "Many subscribers understand that it is  ethically and legally inappropriate to photocopy journal articles and to  distribute them or use them for classes unless they pay a copyright fee; but  because there is a perception that "everything on the Web is free,"  many otherwise sophisticated and ethical individuals believe it is completely  appropriate to print articles from the Web and distribute them, sometimes  without attribution, in ways that they would never think appropriate with a printed  journal." She adds that in the US, many journals sell their mailing lists  of subscribers to any individual or organization that is willing to pay for  them. She believes this is counterproductive and unethical, and her centre does  not sell or trade subscriber lists even though it may be profitable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally Robert Veatch gives some hope; they do make  some money after all: "Our journal is technically owned by Johns Hopkins  University Press so they set all our policies about Internet access. We have  not considered making our journal available on line free, but many universities  have subscriptions to the entire package of Johns Hopkins journals and we get  some income from those fees."
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, there seems to be no clear consensus  or panacea for funding issues or about going online. The issues of logistics  and the dynamics of the print production process seem to vary with geography  and economy. While the developed world does enjoy better access to resources,  and more institutional and overseas subscribers, the problems and dilemmas they  face are similar to those in the developing world. For a developing country  journal of medical ethics, the choices are harder. Since these journals provide  the only platform for ethical thought and debate, it is vital that they be kept  alive. But at what cost?
