					<strong>Kidney transplants: some  realities</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Iread with  much interest the discussion on kidneytransplant and whether the sale of  kidneys should be legally permissible <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S: Ethical issues and the Indian scenario. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 41-43." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kyriazi H: The ethics of organ selling: a liberatarian perspective.

				</p>
				<p>
					A young man coming  from a middle-class Amritsar family needed a kidney transplant. He was admitted  to a government hospital in Chandigarh. The donor was the patient's mother. It  did not work. He was advised another transplant. He got admitted in a private  hospital where the kidney transplant specialist and his colleagues enjoyed a  very high reputation. There was no suitable donor in his family now. The kidney  had to be purchased. The hospital had a network for the purpose &mdash; legal at the  time. The donor was a poor Bengali from Delhi. He was paid only a small part of  what was charged, and the rest went to the doctors' network.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient died. The  father alleged that the donor had not been tested for AIDS and that he most  likely had the disease. There was no post-mortem examination. An enquiry  ordered after much agitation held that no kidney donor had been tested for AIDS  in this hospital. A police case was registered. The doctor concerned got  anticipatory bail from the high court. The father too went to the high court  only to find that the file on the case had been 'misplaced'. The father was  reportedly offered a large sum of money for dropping the matter but refused  saying he would not sell his dead son. Ultimately, however, the costs of the  litigation forced him to give up the fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					The kidney trade  continued to flourish in the same hospital, even after the practice was  declared illegal. Poor people would sell their kidneys and the rich would buy  them to save their lives. I was told that magistrates would attest affidavits  in which a donor said (for instance) that he was a long-time domestic help of  the patient (without actually having been one even for a day) and was donating  a kidney out of affection for his employer. Members of the committee which  clears donations from non-relatives would plead helplessness in the face of an  affidavit attested by a magistrate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ram Nath (not his  real name) is a worker in a woolen mill in Amritsar. He is poor but is insured  under the employees' state insurance scheme towards which deductions are made  from his wages. His wife needed a kidney transplant. The case was referred to  the Post Graduate Institute, Chandigarh. No one in the husband's family could  become a donor though willing because of different blood groups. From the  wife's family one could, but the person was not willing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ram Nath was  desperate to save his wife. He was in debt up to his neck because reimbursement  of the medical bills would take very long. Still, he somehow managed a suitable  kidney for his wife, from a poor man like himself, by paying a price which I  believe was much smaller than in the 'normal' kidney black market. The post  kidney transplant expenses have accumulated to more than Rs 60,000. Ram Nath  does not know what to do because all our pressure on the Punjab government to  release money has not borne results so far. Despite all odds, he is hopeful  that his wife will live because there is his trade union to help him, the  kidney problem having been overcome.
				</p>
				<p>
					Commenting on another  matter, Arun Bal in his editorial <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bal Arun: A doctor's murder. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 39." id="5">(5)</a> rightly differentiates a profession from  commerce, and goes on to say that in a profession, including the medical  profession, "profit is a secondary motive." I feel that even as a secondary  motive, it will result in many unethical practices. The idea of profit should  be divorced altogether from the medical profession, in fact from all services  of this type. Government doctors should have reasonably good salaries and  private doctors should aim at earning more or less equivalent amounts as  salaries of corresponding categories of government doctors.
