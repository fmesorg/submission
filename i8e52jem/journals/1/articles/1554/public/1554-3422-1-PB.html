				<h4>Mapping the human  genome</h4>
				<p>
					Medical science and technology have made great strides in recent times. The  ethical values amidst the various achievements have to be evaluated as science  tends to progress in isolation. In a recent conference of the WHO, in Tokyo, in  which I was also privileged to participate representing India, some important  decisions were made. Most of the nations were represented and included leading  medical scientists and researchers. A declaration on medical ethics which is  now known as the 'Tokyo Declaration' has come out as a product of this  conference.

					Discussion of human genetics is dominated  today by the efforts now under way on an international basis to map and  sequence the human genome. Such attention is warranted by the scale of the  undertaking and its expected contribution to knowledge about human biology and  disease. At the same time the nature of the undertaking concerned as it is with  the basic elements of life, and the potential for abuse of the new knowledge  which the project will generate, are giving rise to anxiety. The conference  agrees that efforts to map the human genome present no inherent ethical  problems but are eminently worthwhile, especially as the knowledge revealed  will be universally applicable to benefit human health. In terms of ethics and  human values, what must be assured are that the manner in which gene mapping  efforts are implemented adheres to ethical standards of research and that the  knowledge gained will be used appropriately, including in genetic screening and  gene therapy.

				<h4>Do technical advances  dehumanise the patient?</h4>
				<p>
					Public concern about the growth of genetic knowledge stems in part from the  misconception that while the knowledge reveals an essential aspect of humanness  it also diminishes human beings by reducing them to mere base pairs of  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This misconqption can be corrected by education of  the public and open discussion, which should reassure the public that plans for  the medical use of genetic findings and techniques will be made openly and  responsibly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some types of genetic testing or treatment not  yet in prospect could raise novel issues, for example, whether limits should be  placed on DNA alternations in human germ cells because such changes would  affect future generations, whose consent cannot be obtained and whose best  interests would be difficult to calculate. The conference concluded, however,  that for the most part present genetic research and services do not raise  unique or even novel issues, although their connection to private matters such  as reproduction and personal health and life prospects, and the rapidity of  advances in genetic knowledge and technology, accentuate the need for ethical  sensitivity in policy making.

				<h4>Disclosure without  consent</h4>
				<p>
					It is primarily in regard to genetic testing that the human genome project  gives rise to concern about ethics and human values. The identification,  cloning, and sequencing of new genes without first needing to know their  protein products greatly expand the possible scope for screening and diagnostic  tests. The central objective of genetic screening and diagnosis should always  be to safeguard the welfare of the person tested: test results must always be  protected against disclosure without consent. Confidentiality must be ensured  at all costs, and adequate counselling must be provided. Physicians and others  who counsel should endeavour to ensure that all those concerned understand the  difference between being the carrier of a defective gene and having the  corresponding genetic disease. In autosomal recessive conditions, the health of  carriers (heterozygotes) is usually not affected by their having a single copy  of the disease gene; in dominant disorders, what is of concern is the  manifestation of the disease, not the mere presence of the defective gene,  especially when years may elapse between the results of a genetic test and the  manifestation of the disease.

				<h4>Clinical application</h4>
				<p>
					The genome project will produce knowledge of relevance to human gene therapy,  which will very soon be clinically applicable to a few rare but very burdensome  recessive disorders. Alternations in somatic cells, which will affect only the  DNA of the treated individual, should be evaluated like other innovative  therapies. Particular attention by independent ethical review committees is  necessary, especially when gene therapy involves children, as it will for many  of the disorders in question. Interventions should be limited to conditions  that cause significant disability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The modification of human germ cells for  therapeutic or preventive purposes would be technically much more difficult  than that of somatic cells and is not at present in prospect. Such therapy  might, however, be the only means of treating certain conditions, so continued  discussion of both its technical and its ethical aspects is therefore  essential. Before germ- line therapy is undertaken, its safety must be very  well established, for changes in germ cells would affect the descendants of  patients.

				<h4>Responsibility of  researchers</h4>
				<p>
					Genetics researchers and therapists have a strong responsibility to ensure that  the techniques they develop are used ethically. By insisting on truly voluntary  programmes designed to benefit directly those involvedm they can ensure that no  precedents are set for eugenic programmes or other misuse of the techniques by  the state or the private parties. One means of ensuring the setting and  observance of ethical standards is continuous multidisciplinary and trans-  culture dialogue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need of developing countries should  receive special attention to ensure that they receive their due share of the  benefits that ensure from the human genome project. In particular, methods and  techniques of testing and therapy that are affordable and easily accessible to  the populations of such countries should be developed and disseminated whenever  possible.
