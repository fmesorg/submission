				<h4>Some general remarks</h4>
				<p>
					As in Albania, so in India, the use of written consent in  medical practice is of relatively recent origin. Before the advent of European  medical education in India, I am not aware of any written consent obtained by  medical doctors before performing invasive procedures on their patients. In  this respect, Albanian doctors were far in advance, registering informed  consent in court five centuries earlier <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vyshka G, Seferi A, Myftari K, Halili V. Last call for an informed consent: confused proxies in extra emergency conditions. Indian J Med Ethics 2014 Oct&ndash;Dec;11(4): 252-4." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The recent moves in India for placing truly informed consent  from patients on record was motivated more by a sense of ethical propriety than  by the fear of litigation. The latter remains relatively infrequent when  compared to the incidence in other more "advanced" countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					As in Albania, so in India, cultural difficulties are  formidable. Rampant illiteracy, total dependency of the poor on those in power  in our villages and the dominance of <em>panchayats</em>, leads the powerless  villager to delegate rights, including decisions on such matters as clinical  trials and epidemiological studies, to local leaders, nullifying the concept of  informed consent by the individual. Even within families, women tend to leave  decisions on interventions and operations on themselves to their husbands or  male elders in the family, meekly placing their thumbprints or signatures as  directed.

				<h4>The case study</h4>
				<p>
					Informed consent was obtained from the patient's eldest son  for the major operation on the brain tumour.
				</p>
				<p>
					As has been rightly pointed out  by the authors, the deterioration in the patient's clinical condition on the  7th postoperative day was unusual in two respects.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Surgery on a  cerebral tumour is usually followed by swelling at the site of surgery and  around it. This swelling, if severe, causes confusion in the mind of the  patient and produces abnormal drowsiness &ndash;a slow and progressive event.
					</li>
					<li>
						In this case,  the deterioration in the reported patient's condition was sudden and was due to  hydrocephalus.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We are not told of the sequence of events from the  development of somnolence on the seventh day to deep coma at midnight. The  decision was made at 2 am to insert a shunt into the brain to drain the  abnormal collection of cerebrospinal fluid.
				</p>
				<p>
					The controversy revolves around whether it was right to have  obtained the consent of the only relative present when this decision was made.  The eldest son was not available then.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some relevant facts need to be  considered.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						In the  surgeon's opinion, this was a life-saving operation on a patient in deep coma.
					</li>
					<li>
						Consent of the  patient was not available in view of the coma.
					</li>
					<li>
						The relative  available in the hospital was presumably an adult (this is not specifically  stated in the report).
					</li>
					<li>
						After initial  hesitation, the relative signed the consent form on behalf of the comatose  patient.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is standard  practice that for life-saving operations, consent is obtained from the relative  available by the patient's bedside. Attempts at obtaining consent from other  relatives would entail a delay that could prove fatal to the patient.
					</li>
					<p>
						<em>When  no relative is available, the practice in Indian hospitals is for the surgeon  to certify the life-saving nature of the surgery, inform the administrative  head of the institution and proceed to perform the surgery in the best interest  of the patient. In effect, the surgeon provides the legal consent for the  surgery.</em>
					</p>
					<li>
						The next  morning after the operation, this relative "withdrew his approval".
					</li>
					<p>
						I am not aware  of the legal status of such withdrawal of consent <em>after the event.</em>Certainly  it is illogical since the surgery has already been performed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Differences of  opinion between relatives must be sorted out between themselves, the treating  doctors and the institution playing no role in this event.
					</p>

					Ethical pitfalls
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors list two ethical pitfalls.
				</p>
				<h5>Emergency of the situation</h5>
				<p>
					This decision can only be made by the treating physician or  surgeon and is offered as his considered opinion to the patient, relative(s).  This opinion is accompanied by a recommendation for corrective action and the  likely consequences of such step(s). Questioning this decision later is fraught  with danger as it amounts to offering an opinion without being present at the  time and without being in full possession of the facts.
				</p>
				<h5>Availability of a competent  decision-making relative</h5>
				<p>
					It is assumed that the relative looking after the patient's  welfare in the hospital in the middle of the night is a competent authority to  grant consent. In 2014, with the universal availability of telephone  facilities, it should not take more than a few minutes for this relative to  consult others &ndash; in this instance, the eldest son &ndash; if such a need is felt.
				</p>
				<h5>A third pitfall</h5>
				<p>
					Not listed as such but posed under the heading "Ethical  pitfalls" is the question of the medical specialist bypassing the decision made  by the relative by the patient's bedside on the ground that the relative cannot  understand midnight explanations.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is foolhardy for a medical attendant to take this step.  Just as this relative's consent is valid reason to proceed with surgery, the  relative's refusal to permit surgery is also valid. Under such a circumstance,  the medical specialist has two options: a) to inform the person who had earlier  given consent (in this case, the eldest son) and obtain a directive on the  telephone, to be later confirmed in writing b) to inform the head of the  institution and follow his/her instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors suggest two other  solutions.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Obtaining an  informed consent approved and signed initially when the first operation is  proposed in anticipation of a complication. This is debatable on two major  grounds. First, complications are often unexpected. In this case, hydrocephalus  was a remote possibility. Second, it would be necessary to discuss in detail  each of several possible complications and obtain written consents for the  treatment of each of them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Doing away with  the obtaining of informed consent for life-saving procedures. "Seeking informed  consent for a life-saving procedure is senseless. Doing so will further increase  the confusion of the proxies, who have little time to understand in emergency  conditions and thus to decide, and will increase the chances of the case ending  in litigation." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vyshka G, Seferi A, Myftari K, Halili V. Last call for an informed consent: confused proxies in extra emergency conditions. Indian J Med Ethics 2014 Oct&ndash;Dec;11(4): 252-4." id="1">(1)</a>. This is unethical and illegal in India.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					A definitive solution would be to obtain (i) the names,  telephone numbers and addresses of those authorised to permit invasive tests  and treatments when the patient is admitted to hospital, and (ii) a statement  permitting the relative present at the patient's bedside to grant permission  for treatment (including surgery) in an emergency.
