				<h4>Are we making asses out of racing horses in
				medicine?</h4>
				<p>
					This question was asked by a thinking medical faculty member
					(a rare breed!) in a national institution. As usual, the majority of
					medical teachers were too 'busy' and missed it. Of those who did
					read the newspaper report, a minuscule few dared to air their
					views on the subject. Some medical teachers whose neurons
					still had intact myelin sheaths reacted positively. But it did not
					register for the vast majority with atrophy from disuse.
				</p>
				<p>
					This indifference is not abnormal, as health policy has never been
					an important agenda item in this country. Our nervous system
					is not used to reacting to health issues. The medical profession
					has failed to influence health policy. It is content to participate
					in programmes like pulse polio drives and observe international
					health days and those of some popular diseases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health policy should be a topic of public debate. After all,
					it concerns the health of the citizenry. Since we do not feel
					concerned, discussion is restricted to the cognitive domains of a
					few health officials who rise to their own level of incompetence
					according to Peter's principle. Then there are rotating bureaucrats
					who by sheer chance get the opportunity to warm the chair of
					the health department. There was a time when health ministers
					were chosen from among eminent doctors. The less said about
					today's politicians, the better.
				</p>
				<p>
					But one cannot blame only the bureaucracy. Medical activism
					has become an endangered species. The medical profession
					looks askance at 'ambulance chasers' because it does not want
					its doings and 'undoings' examined under a microscope. It is
					unfortunate that those who should be charting the health
					course of the country have hardly any sensitivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students entering medical colleges on merit are considered
					to be the cream of the student population. Unfortunately they
					do not get any opportunity to refine and demonstrate their
					skills. Instead of teaching them how to use their intelligence to
					solve problems the present system converts their brilliance to
					mediocrity. As skills are hardly put to use they eventually start
					rusting.
				</p>

				<h4>Medical teachers are responsible</h4>
				<p>
					Our medical teachers should share some blame for this. They did
					not cherish individuality and freedom of thought.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unfortunate that medical teachers have mortgaged their
					brains. Most are content to deliver 10 lectures per six-month
					term. Many senior teachers do not teach at all, though they have
					teaching assignments on paper. In 25 years of medical teaching,
					I am yet to see a departmental head or a dean devoting even
					one hour a week to pure teaching. Some medical teachers are
					'out of circulation' because they are busier with administrative,
					academic, university or political work, which for them is more
					important than teaching. There are some privileged ones who obtain various kinds of leave when their lecture series starts.
					One popular escape is known as 'oblique practice': teaching
					timetable planners write two names against each assignment,
					and the senior teacher always has a junior 'assistant'. When it
					comes to self-assessments, both will claim to have conducted
					the same classes. They even manage to get awards for 'ideal'
					and 'best' teacher. If such is the aptitude and attitude of medical
					teachers what altitude is expected from them?
				</p>
				<p>
					Those entering medical teaching today are mostly mediocre,
					ineffective communicators with neither knowledge of the
					subject nor teaching skills. They choose teaching because they
					cannot do anything else - even after having been gifted medical
					degrees. Those who have never run a race themselves become
					in charge of the stud farm. An average teacher stays in service
					for 30-35 years. Imagine the impact of inefficient teachers on the
					many batches of students handled by them. A whole generation
					of brilliant students is affected and afflicted with mediocrity.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we do not wake up to correct this malady, our young colts and
					mares, with the potential to win races, will be reduced to asses.

				<h4>Subscription number 001</h4>
				<p>
					I was surprised to receive a copy for which I was given a
					subscription number 001 for the state of Bihar. I had seen a
					specimen copy of the journal in our college library and found it
					very interesting and worth subscribing to.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it is the subscription number which has made me think and
					write about the lack of medical ethics awareness (although many
					doctors may be subscribing to other medical ethics journals
					and also reading them). People in this state are among the most
					deprived in India. It is a state where private practice is allowed
					and this has led to the worst conditions in health institutions.
					In our hospital, patients who are admitted think it a boon if
					they escape death. The worst medicine is practised in this
					institute. We doctors have no sense of responsibility towards
					patients and in turn patients and their attendants have no
					faith in government doctors here. Prescriptions are irrational,
					patient input is very low and output even low for emergency
					admissions.
