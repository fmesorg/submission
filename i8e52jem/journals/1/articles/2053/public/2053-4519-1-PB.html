				<h4>Consent for intimate  examinations</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty students are huddled around a patient trying to auscultate a cardiac  murmur. Others try to percuss the chest of a patient with emphysema, oblivious  of the patient's agony each time the plexor strikes the pleximeter. An elderly  gentleman complaining of difficulty in passing urine finds that all the  students in the department will perform rectal examinations to feel his  enlarged prostate, apparently unaware of the discomfort this could cause. The  primigravida in the pangs of labour finds she is subject to a succession of  students estimating the dilatation of the os in a per vaginal examination.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such memories came back to me when I read an article on the ethics of having  medical students learn through intimate physical examinations <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Coldicott Y, Pope C. The ethics of intimate examinations-teaching tomorrow's doctors. BMJ 2003;326: 97-101." id="1">(1)</a>. Students  responding to a questionnaire described how they had performed intimate  examinations, including on sedated patients, without consent; often, many  students examined the same patient. The report generated a heated debate on the  ethics of such examinations for teaching purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
					How many medical colleges in India even have written policies and guidelines on  the subject? Once I asked a class of third-year medical students what they  understood of medical ethics. Eight out of 20 said they had never heard of the  term. What would their experiences be on learning how to conduct physical  examinations?
				</p>
				<p>
					This blase attitude is common in our outpatient departments. Students are  enthusiastic about developing their skills even as they ignore the patient's  perspective. Today, people challenge the notion that such practices can be  justified because of the need to train students. Patients cannot be used as  teaching aids without their consent. They must be treated with dignity.
