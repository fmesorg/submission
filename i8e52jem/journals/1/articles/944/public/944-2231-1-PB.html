				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to investigate
					the viewpoint of fertile Iranian women on gestational surrogacy.
					A convenience sample of 230 fertile women was invited to
					participate in the study and 185 consented. Data were collected
					via a 22-item scale that assessed the viewpoints of the participants
					in five domains related to gestational surrogacy. The viewpoints
					reported by the women were positive. However, a significant
					percentage of them believed that commissioning couples are not
					the biological owners of the baby, religious barriers need to be
					overcome prior to legal barriers, children born through surrogacy
					may face emotional issues, and the adoption of children may be a
					better option than surrogacy. The negative views of the women on
					some key aspects make it clear that public education is needed to
					increase the acceptability of gestational surrogacy.

					Iran is an Islamic country in which gestational surrogacy has
					attracted the attention of many infertile couples seeking
					a solution to their problem. It should be noted that the
					majority of the Iranian population consists of Shiite Muslims
					and most Shiite scholars have accepted this form of ART <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Aramesh K.

					Iran currently boasts of approximately 50 in vitro fertilisation
					(IVF) clinics, one of the highest numbers in the Middle East
					and similar to the number of such clinics found in Egypt. Iran
					is the only Muslim country in which IVF using donor gametes
					and embryos has been accepted by the religious authorities
					and passed into law by parliament. It may be mentioned that
					despite religious acceptance, all types of surrogacy, including
					gestational surrogacy, were not legal in Iran and there is no
					approved law in Iran for any type of surrogacy <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Aramesh K.

					Little empirical research has been conducted in Iran to explore
					public opinion on gestational surrogacy or the acceptability
					of this intervention among infertile and fertile women. In their
					study, Sohrabvand and Jafarabadi found that less than half
					of the infertile couples have an adequate knowledge of ART
					methods and a small number accept gestational surrogacy
					<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sohrabvand F, Jafarabadi M. Knowledge and attitudes of infertile couples about assisted reproductive technology. Iran J Reprod Med. 2005;3(2):90-4." id="21">(21)</a>. The viewpoints of others, especially fertile women, greatly
					influence infertile women's use of gestational surrogacy. There
					have been no previous studies that investigate gestational
					surrogacy from the perspective of fertile Iranian women. This
					study aims to address this gap in the current research.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted between
					March and September, 2009. The participants were recruited
					through the Al-Zahra Hospital, which is affiliated to the
					Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. This hospital is a major
					centre for gynaecological services in the East Azerbaijan
					Province, a northwestern province of Iran, and one of the
					main centres for ART services. A total of 230 fertile women
					were invited to participate and 185 consented to enroll in the
					study (acceptance rate=80%). The inclusion criteria included
					having at least one child or being pregnant at the time of data
					collection and being 18 years of age or older.
				</p>
				<p>
					The participants were asked to complete a written
					questionnaire, which consisted of three sections. The first
					section pertained to the demographic data and the second
					to the maternal history. The third section consisted of a 22-
					item scale aimed at investigating the participants' attitudes
					to gestational surrogacy, which was considered under five
					domains, including legal and religious issues (7 items),
					conditions for the use of surrogacy (4 items), children born
					through surrogacy (5 items), surrogate mother (2 items), and
					tendency to use surrogacy (4 items). Most of these items were
					derived from relevant studies conducted in the past <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Besharat MA, Hossein-Zadeh Bazargan R.

					However, some items were added on the basis of the expertise
					of the research team and also, to ensure that the questionnaire
					was culturally appropriate. Each item was rated on the basis
					of a five-point Likert scale, with 1="completely disagree" and
					5="completely agree". The scores for each item ranged from
					1 to 5. A higher score for an item indicated a more positive
					view of gestational surrogacy with respect to that item. The
					questionnaire was reviewed by 15 academic staff members
					from the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences and revised
					accordingly in order to enhance the validity of the content.
					The test-retest reliability of the scale was established (0.92)
					following a pilot study that included 25 fertile women.
				</p>
				<p>
					For data collection, two of the researchers visited the selected
					hospital daily to invite women who met the inclusion criteria
					to participate in the study. Women who chose to participate
					and were literate completed the questionnaire alone. However,
					for women who chose to participate and were illiterate, the
					researchers conducted a private interview in which they read
					out the questionnaire to the women and completed it on the
					basis of their responses.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee
					of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. All participants
					were free to participate voluntarily in the study and informed
					consent was obtained prior to enrolment in the study. Statistical
					analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for
					Social Science (SPSS), version 17.0.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					All the women who participated in the study were Muslim and
					married. The mean age and mean length of marital life were
					30.6 (7.7) years and 9.38 (8.47) years, respectively. Over 90%
					of the women were housewives and 25.4% had a university
					degree. While 67.5% had at least one child, the others were
					pregnant.
				</p>
				<p>
					The women's responses to each item of the questionnaire
					are presented in Table 1. In general, their views on surrogacy
					were positive, but there were some important exceptions.
					A significant percentage of the women believed that
					commissioning couples are not the legal parents. The majority
					thought that surrogacy should be the last resort and that
					adopting a child is a better solution for infertile women who
					want a child. A majority were of the opinion that children born
					through surrogacy should not be informed about their birth
					history and that if they were, they could experience emotional problems. A significant percentage of the women reported that
					they would not recommend gestational surrogacy to infertile
					women. Religious barriers were identified as a major challenge
					to the acceptability of surrogacy and most of the women felt
					that these barriers needed to be addressed prior to addressing
					legal barriers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					This is the first study to investigate the perspectives of fertile
					Iranian women on gestational surrogacy. Overall, the majority
					of the respondents viewed gestational surrogacy positively. This
					research complements previous research carried out in Iran to
					explore the perspectives of infertile women. Sohrabvand and
					Jafarabadi demonstrated that 95% of infertile couples in Tehran,
					the capital of Iran, had a negative attitude towards gestational
					surrogacy <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sohrabvand F, Jafarabadi M.

					unacceptable option for infertile couples. In addition, in a study
					conducted in Turkey, only 24% of the infertile women surveyed

				</p>
				<p>
					Despite positive attitudes in each of the five investigated
					domains, some aspects of gestational surrogacy were not to
					the liking of the participants. The women's knowledge of the
					legal and religious aspects of gestational surrogacy was limited,
					and raising awareness could possibly raise the acceptability of
					this procedure. A considerable percentage believed that the
					surrogate mother, and not the commissioning couple, should
					be the legal guardian of the child. Also, the participants were
					of the opinion that religious barriers should be resolved prior
					to undergoing the procedure. According to the rules, the
					child that is born should be delivered to the commissioning
					couple <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Poote AE, van den Akker OBA. British women's attitudes to surrogacy.

					gestational surrogacy, or other types of surrogacy, in Iran.

					The results of this questionnaire indicate the need for further
					education of the community on the religious aspects of
					gestational surrogacy, as well as the need for government
					regulation of this procedure. Evidence demonstrating the
					benefits of surrogacy and dispelling the fear that children born
					through surrogacy may experience emotional problems could
					be important in generating support for gestational surrogacy.
					This, in turn, could play an important part in promoting
					changes in legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The participants in the study believed that while children born
					through gestational surrogacy should be informed about
					their birth history, this knowledge may give rise to emotional
					problems. Infertile women in Iran have expressed similar
					concerns in previous research <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rahmani A, Sattarzadeh N, Gholizadeh L, Sheikhalipour Z, Allahbakhshian A, Hassankhani H.

In another study conducted by Van Den
					Akker, the majority of the mothers of children born through
					surrogacy reported that their children's mental and physical
					health and development were appropriate <a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="van den Akker OBA. Psychosocial aspects of surrogate motherhood. Hum Reprod Update. 2007 Jan-Feb; 13(1):53-62. doi:10.1093/humupd/dml039" id="32">(32)</a>. The differences
					in the beliefs of Iranian women and western women regarding
					potential harm to children born through surrogacy suggests
					that the former may lack information, which gives rise to
					unjustified concerns.
				</p>
				<p>
					The participants had positive attitudes towards surrogate
					mothers and did not believe that they were devoid of dignity
					or virtue. Kilic et al found that 58.3% of infertile Turkish
					women who had no objection to surrogacy approved of only
					their sisters, family members and friends being the surrogate
					mother <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kilic S, Ucar M, Yaren H, Gulec M, Atac A, Demirel F, Karabulut C, Demirel O.

					respondents would accept only their family members and
					friends as the surrogate mother <a class="reference" href="#thirtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Stern JE, Cramer CP, Garrod A, Green RM. 2002.

					reported that surrogate mothers were no different from other
					women in terms of the social support they received, the quality
					of their attachment to the child, and their attitude towards
					pregnancy <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fischer S, Gillman I. Surrogate motherhood: Attachment, attitudes and social support. Psychiatry. 1991 Feb;54(1):13-20." id="34">(34)</a>. These results showed that the attitude towards
					surrogate mothers is positive in Iran and could contribute to
					the acceptance of gestational surrogacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					A considerable percentage of the participants in the study
					would not recommend surrogacy to infertile women and
					preferred adoption. Kilic et al reported that 59.6% of infertile
					Turkish women had a positive attitude towards adoption,
					and only 24% viewed gestational surrogacy favourably <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kilic S, Ucar M, Yaren H, Gulec M, Atac A, Demirel F, Karabulut C, Demirel O.

					This is consistent with a study by Baykal et al, who found that
					only 15.1% of infertile Turkish women consider surrogacy
					acceptable <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baykal B, Korkmaz C, Ceyhan ST, Goktolga U, Baser I.

Similar attitudes were documented by
					Rahmani et al , who found that the majority of infertile Iranian
					women (59.9%) would not recommend surrogacy, with 32.8%
					preferring adoption to surrogacy <a class="reference" href="#twentyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rahmani A, Sattarzadeh N, Gholizadeh L, Sheikhalipour Z, Allahbakhshian A, Hassankhani H.

					This study has certain limitations. Although the attitudes of
					fertile women were investigated, those of others, particularly
					men, were not. In addition, the study was undertaken in a single
					hospital, limiting the generalisability of its findings to other
					areas of Iran. Due to the lack of availability of a validated scale,
					a researcher prepared the instrument that was used. Therefore,
					this scale was not validated by factor analysis. This scale will
					undergo validation in future studies.
