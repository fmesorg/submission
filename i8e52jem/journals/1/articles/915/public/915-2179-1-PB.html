				<h4>Void in the sphere of wisdom: a distorted picture of homosexuality in medical textbooks</h4>
				<p>
					Homosexuality is not a new issue in western medical literature;  													but an empathetic approach to it in the medical literature in  													India is a recent phenomenon <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao TS, Jacob KS. Homosexuality and India. Indian J Psychiatry. 2012 Jan; 54(1):1-3." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kalra G. Breaking the Ice: IJP on homosexuality. Indian J Psychiatry. 2012 Jul; 54(3):299-300." id="2">2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Patel VV, Mayer KH, Makadon HJ. Men who have sex with men in India: A diverse population in need of medical attention. Indian J Med Res. 2012 Oct; 136(4): 563-70." id="3">3)</a>. Equality in providing healthcare is not being practised, as evidenced by homophobia  													among doctors <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Geddes VA. Lesbian expectations and experiences with family doctors. How much does the physician's sex matter to lesbians? Can Fam Physician.1994 May;40:908-20." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Harrison AE, Silenzio VM. Comprehensive care of lesbian and gay patients and families. Prim Care.1996 Mar;23(1):31-46." id="5">5)</a>, more so in the Indian sub-continent  													where religious and social biases contribute to denying proper  													healthcare to the homosexual - as well as the lesbian, bisexual  													and transgender - community. The attitudes of young medical  													students are more amenable to change, and can be better  													oriented towards providing equitable healthcare, irrespective  													of the sexual orientation of patients <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kalra G. Pathologising alternate sexuality: shifting psychiatric practices and a need for ethical norms and reforms. Indian J Med Ethics. 2012 Oct- Dec;9(4):291." id="6">(6)</a>. Here the question  													arises: "What does our curriculum teach about sexuality issues?"
				</p>
				<p>
					We highlight the misleading information given in the  													textbooks widely followed by the students of the West Bengal  													University of Health Sciences. The most affected subjects are  													physiology, psychiatry and forensic medicine. According to  													the physiology textbook, in puberty "there develops attraction  													to opposite sex." <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mahapatra AB. Reproductive System. In: Essentials of Medical Physiology. 3rd edition. Kolkata: Current Books International; 2007. p. 363-84." id="8">(8)</a>. This clearly promotes heterosexuality  													as the only norm. Some forensic science textbooks state  													that homosexuality is an "offence", homosexuals "may be  													psychologically imbalanced", and they are "egoists", who  													"disregard society" and pose a "social, moral and psychological  													problem". <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mukherjee JB. Medicolegal aspects of sex and sex related offence. In: Karmakar RN, editor. Forensic Medicine & Toxicology. 4th edition. Kolkata: Academic Publishers; 2011. p. 567-695." id="9">(9)</a> The term "crime of homosexuality" has been used and "treatment of homosexuality" has been suggested <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mukherjee JB. Medicolegal aspects of sex and sex related offence. In: Karmakar RN, editor. Forensic Medicine & Toxicology. 4th edition. Kolkata: Academic Publishers; 2011. p. 567-695." id="9">(9)</a>.  													Some books say "AIDS infection is commonly transmitted by  													unnatural sex acts with the homosexuals" <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mukherjee JB. Medicolegal aspects of sex and sex related offence. In: Karmakar RN, editor. Forensic Medicine & Toxicology. 4th edition. Kolkata: Academic Publishers; 2011. p. 567-695." id="9">(9)</a> and call sodomy  													"a sexual offence" which is most popular and widely practised  													among homosexuals <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nandy A. Sexual offences and sex perversions. In: Principles of Forensic Medicine including Toxicology.3rd edition. Kolkata: New Central Book Agency (P) Ltd; 2010. p. 687-720." id="10">(10)</a>. This portrays same sex behaviour as  													an inferior form of sexuality. In spite of a long debate on the  													controversial term 'gay bowel syndrome' as it indicates a link  													between homosexual activity and gastro-intestinal disease, it  													is still referred to in a standard microbiology textbook <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ananthanarayanan R, Panicker CKJ. Enterobacteriaceae II: Shigella. In: Textbook of Microbiology. 8th edition. Hyderabad: University Press;2009.p.283-87." id="11">(11)</a>. A widely followed textbook of psychiatry uses terms like   "crossgender homosexuality" and "ego-dystonic homosexuality" <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahuja N. Sexual disorders. In: A short textbook of psychiatry. 6th edition. New Delhi: Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd;2006. p.132-6." id="12">(12)</a>.

					We suggest substantial revision in the undergraduate medical  													syllabus and textbooks as these are the main sources of  													knowledge for doctors. If distorted information is provided  													from the start of their medical education, any seminars or  													discussions will be in vain. An unbiased discussion of concepts  													like sexual behaviour, orientation, identity, sex and gender are  													much needed. Specific diseases which affect homosexuals  													must be highlighted rather than providing the "treatment  													guidelines of homosexuality" <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ranade K. Medical response to male same-sex sexuality in Western India: An exploration of 'conversion treatments' for homosexuality[Internet]. Health and Population Innovation Fellowship Programme Working Paper, No. 8. New Delhi: Population Council; 2009[cited 2013 Apr 11]. Available from: http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/wp/India_HPIF/008.pdf" id="13">(13)</a>. Policy makers, educationalists,  													authors and thoughtful readers must come forward to fill this  													void in the sphere of wisdom and forge a better patient-doctor  													relationship.
