				<h4>Issues in Medical Ethics (5)</h4>
				<p>
					Your editing of the special issue of Humanscape was very nice! It will definitely help to carry the message of medical ethics to a wider section - an enlightened one - of our society. We can expect more activity in this field in future. It will be interesting to know the feed-back from the non-medical readers of that magazine,
