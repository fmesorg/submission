				<h4>Doctors  and the CAT scam</h4>
				<p>
					With  the arrest of Ranjit Singh, the CBI exposed an enormous racket in papers for  management and medical entrance examinations. Some interesting bits of  information given to the press by CBI 'sources': Ranjit Singh is a qualified  doctor. Some 150 doctors are reported to have been involved, acting as touts  for Singh; several of them were formerly his clients. The medical entrance  examination question papers cost between Rs 10 lakh and 12 lakh. The service  was promoted by word of mouth, by satisfied 'students' and their parents who  found it cheaper than paying donations to private colleges. His list of clients  included a large number of doctors with whom he had an unwritten agreement that  they would prescribe medicines manufactured by his pharmaceutical company Redon  till their wards completed the course. Redon registered a turnover of Rs 60  crore in its first year. Singh is reported to have made Rs 100 crore a year  through the CBSE medical exam papers alone.

					What do  you get if you combine Ajanta&ndash;Ellora, Mahabaleshwar and the Konkan coast with  20,000-odd medical specialists and hi-tech tertiary care hospitals?
				</p>
				<p>
					On November  19, 2003 the Medical Tourism Council of Maharashtra was formally launched in  the presence of health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar, chief secretary Ajit  Nimbalkar, medical education secretary G S Gill, FICCC-WRC chairman Sushil  Jiwrajka and union minister of state for commerce and industry S B Mookherjee.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  point: Maharashtra has a 'winning combination' of tourist destinations and  world-class healthcare facilities which can provide treatment at one-fifth the  cost in western countries. The medical tourism industry is expected to grow at  30 % annually. Public hospitals are also a part of the deal. Khanvilkar  declared that the government was upgrading these hospitals to attract the  middle-class medical tourist.

				<h4>Need  to protect nurses in hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					The  Delhi High Court has admitted a petition seeking registration of an FIR against  Shanti Mukund Hospital, GTB Hospital and their doctors for allegedly failing to  take proper care of a nurse who was raped and blinded by an employee of the  Shanti Mukund Hospital in September 2003. The National Commission for Women  (NCW) had held both hospitals guilty of medical negligence and called for  cancellation of Shanti Mukund's licence. The victim was left unattended for  hours after the rape became known, and eventually referred to the GTB hospital  which delayed treatment. The NCW also issued recommendations for protection of  nurses.

				<h4>Code  of ethics for hospitals in Andhra</h4>
				<p>
					Private  nursing homes and hospitals in Hyderabad will now have to follow a code of  ethics requiring them to standardise their rates, make their billing  transparent, counsel patients and follow clear procedures for diagnosis and  treatment. The code is to be followed by all the 450 institutions registered  under the Andhra Pradesh Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association's  Hyderabad and Rangareddy district branch. Inpatients must be told why they are  being admitted, results of preliminary tests, plan of treatment and the  estimated cost.

				<h4>HC  directive to review Nursing Homes Registration Rules</h4>
				<p>
					The  Delhi High Court has asked the Delhi state government to review the Delhi  Nursing Homes Registration Rules, 1993, to improve services offered by ICUs in  nursing homes in the state. It also asked the government to implement the  recommendations of an expert committee on nursing homes. These recommendations  cover space, drugs, equipment and staff requirements in nursing homes and ICUs,  including specialist ICUs. The committee was formed after the doctors and  management of Sunderlal Jain Charitable Hospital were held liable for the death  of a patient in the ICU.

				<h4>Tooth  extraction or heart surgery?</h4>
				<p>
					How  much could it cost to get some teeth extracted? Well, it could be Rs 1,16,777,  if you happen to be the dependant of a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL)  employee. That is the bill handed over by a Kolkata-based employee for getting  his son's teeth extracted at the private Suraksha Hospital. The hospital says  the extraordinary charge is because the patient developed complications and had  to be shifted to the ICU.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  result at BSNL: a circular stating: 'It is imperative that a thorough analysis  be made... regarding empanelment of hospitals and the rates applicable there.'

				<h4>The  state of public hospitals in Kolkata</h4>
				<p>
					If  private hospitals charge exorbitant rates, the state of government hospitals in  Kolkata is surely of far more concern. A number of reports in the Telegraph in  October and November describe scenes of patients dying for want of care, or  because the necessary drugs and equipment are not available. Touts lurk in the  hallways and everything, from drugs to a hospital bed, is available at a price.  The government responded by suspending doctors, cutting pay, and other such  punishments. Aggrieved patients attacked doctors, sending them on strike, and  naturally, political parties have made use of the situation. www.telegraphindia.com

					The  Maharashtra University of Health Sciences has prevented 12 medical colleges in  the state from admitting new students and asked them to re-apply for  recognition when their infrastructure meets the guidelines of the Medical  Council of India. These include two government-run colleges, five ayurvedic  colleges, one homoeopathic college and one dental college.

				<h4>Doctor  commits suicide</h4>
				<p>
					The  apparent suicide of Dr Vinod Gobind Baramera, a resident MBBS doctor, has  triggered off discussion on the stress faced by medical students who must cope  with long working hours and the emotional attachment to patients in distress.  This is worse for students coming from small towns or underprivileged  backgrounds, who may have difficulty in socialising with urban and well-off  students.

				<h4>Nepal  hospital regulations: can we have an update?</h4>
				<p>
					In July  2002, the Nepal government announced plans to regulate health services  effective from January 2003. This was announced at a workshop organised by the  Ministry of Health in Kathmandu on 'Review of criteria for private health  institutions in Nepal'. The guidelines laid down include the following: (i)  Medical professionals would not be allowed to work at more than two  institutions. (ii) Private hospitals and nursing homes would have to provide  facilities for emergency, outpatient and surgery services, among others. (iii)  Hospitals with over 100 beds would have to have a blood bank. (iv) Charges would  be determined by a committee formed by the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					Institutions  would be required to display, for the general public, information about their  services, names of attending doctors and their academic qualifications,  available health equipment and manpower, and the fees charged. Institutions  registered as research centres would have to carry out research on a minimum of  two new subjects in a year.

				<h4>Bangladesh:  how to reduce long lines at public hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Over  1,500 people visit outpatient departments at the Dhaka Medical College  Hospital, Bangladesh's largest hospital, every day. Two medical officers in  each department struggle to provide treatment of some sort to the crowd,  despite the shortage of equipment and drug. The rush is regulated by brokers  who direct patients to the same doctors' private chambers for speedy  treatment&mdash;where these patients, who are the poorest of the poor, will have to  pay. Patients who need inpatient treatment must give a bribe to get a bed. All  this happens under the nose of the hospital authorities.

				<h4>When  in doubt, take it out</h4>
				<p>
					When  the Pakistan Medical Association investigated an epidemic of abdominal pain and  other symptoms from what seemed to be a water-borne disease, it came up with  surprising results. Doctors in Chokera village near Sargodha had not identified  the cause of the problem, but that did not stop them from making some money by  performing appendectomies on more than 120 people.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  local health officer expressed inability to comment on the cause of the problem  and also avoided comments on the surgery conducted by private medical  practitioners.

				<h4>Sri  Lanka: healthcare workers' strike</h4>
				<p>
					Some  80,000 Sri Lankan healthcare workers went on strike demanding salary increases,  paralysing work in public hospitals in the island.
				</p>
				<p>
					This  was the latest of a series of strikes in 2003 beginning with registered medical  practitioners, doctors, nurses, paramedics, technicians and minor staff, mostly  over salary anomalies. They crippled services&mdash;resulting in a few deaths from  lack of medical attention&mdash;and prompted the mobilisation of hundreds of soldiers  to help out in state hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Trade  union activists called the use of the armed forces a violation of the  Constitution and a repression of trade union rights. Others expressed anger at  the striking medical staff and supported the government's use of unarmed  soldiers to help poor patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patient  rights groups such as the National Movement for the Rights of Patients support  an arbitration process for the Health Ministry and trade unions to settle  disputes and prevent recurring strikes by healthcare workers.

				<h4>Missing  girls</h4>
				<p>
					The  continued skewing of the child sex ratio in India has shocked demographers and  policy-makers. Calculated as the number of girls per 1000 boys in the age group  of 0&ndash;6 years, the ratio declined from 945 girls per 1,000 boys in the 1991  census to 927 in the 2001 census. (It was 976 in 1961.)
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  2001 census, four states&mdash;Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat&mdash;had less  than 800 girls per 1000 boys. The reason: an epidemic of sex-selective abortion  supported by cheap ultrasound machines used for sex determination, used even in  remote areas despite legislation.
				</p>
				<p>
					These  'missing girls' essentially means that millions of medical consultations  leading to abortions have taken place with the active connivance of the medical  community, who make a quick buck out of them, says Dr Puneet Bedi, a  Delhi-based gynaecologist.
