				<p>
					After the International Conference on Population and
					Development in Cairo in 1994, the debates around
					how to effectively reduce the population of the
					country became very civilised. Everybody began talking
					about the issue of human rights of women and denouncing
					the programme that targeted thousands of them with forced
					sterilisations and other contraceptive procedures. It seemed
					that the days of coercive measures to acquire the required
					family size, were gone.
				</p>
				<p>
					We in women's groups, who had been shouting ourselves
					hoarse about the atrocities of the family planning (FP)
					programme, were assured that target orientation was a thing
					of the past (to be forgotten) and that the days of consent,
					with the focus on larger issues of reproductive and sexual
					health, had arrived. Soon the FP Programme was rechristened
					the Family Welfare programme, and people and
					government functionaries started trying to figure out what
					exactly had to be different in the newly started Reproductive
					and Child Health (RCH) Programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, it did not take long for reality to surface. The
					motives of the population control programme being handled
					by the RCH programme soon started becoming visible. Under
					the garb of meeting the "unmet need" of contraceptives,
					harmful, long-acting, hormonal injections were made
					available in the open market and then through serviceproviding
					non-governmental organisations. Of late there has
					been talk of introducing them in the state-run hospitals as
					part of the RCH programme. Targets for sterilisations
					continued and for most government functionaries they
					remained a reality.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally we had the first ever national population policy
					which was passed at the centre without much debate and
					which was followed or preceded by various state level
					population policies <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India: National Population Policy 2000. New Delhi, 2000." id="1">(1)</a>. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
					began the trend and Maharashtra soon followed. None of
					these state policies minced any words while stating their
					intentions and motives and the measures they would take to
					achieve the reduction in population.

				<h4>The Maharashtra state population policy</h4>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra state population policy, announced in
					March 2000, stresses the 'small family norm' to achieve
					overall targets for reduction of the fertility rate, birth rate,
					infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate. Various
					methods suggested include awarding those who help the
					state achieve its targets, though most methods are about
					punishing those of the populace who fail to adhere to the
					requirement of the small family <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of Maharashtra: Maharashtra State Population Policy March 2000. Mumbai." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those who dare to have a third child after May 2001 will
					not be entitled to many government schemes, many
					allowances if part of the state machinery, and the freedom to
					contest elections for local governance bodies. A subsequent
					government order stated clearly that the third child thus born would not be entitled to food and other subsidised
					goods offered under the public distribution scheme. These
					families would not also be entitled to as many as 50
					government schemes meant for the needy <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Maharashtra to come down hard on that third child. The Indian Express. September 2000" id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Apart from these restrictive measures, the policy talks of
					other measures like improving the services of the health
					system by awarding discipline and good behaviour of health
					providers; strict implementation of some of the existing acts
					like the Child Marriage Act and the Prenatal Sex
					Determination Techniques Act; assessing government
					functionaries and panchayats for their performance in family
					planning and awarding subsequent rewards and
					punishments to them; and forming various committees and
					councils under the able guidance of the chief minister, the
					deputy chief minister and even the "Honourable Chief
					Minister's wife" and the "Guardian minister's wife"!
				</p>
				<p>
					So here we have it all laid bare for us. The targets, the
					process of rewarding and the methods of disincentives and
					punishments all continue. Families (in actuality women) will
					now be forced to accept whatever family planning methods
					are made available because producing more than two
					children can be suicidal for the whole family. Thus the policy
					ensures that there will be no need for coercion for acceptance
					of contraceptive methods. The coercion to not produce, of
					course, continues.
				</p>
				<p>
					The aim of the family planning programme has been
					controlling numbers, particularly the numbers of the poor.
					This policy, by penalising the poorest of the poor, in fact
					states this most clearly. Further, in doing so, it does not at all
					tackle the problem that it presumably set out to solve &mdash;
					that of scarcity (at least as stated by most proponents of
					population control). Their understanding of the population
					problem itself is, however, problematic.
				</p>

				<h4>The population "problem"</h4>
				<p>
					As kids we have all gone through the misery or joy of solving
					'arithmetic sums' of the kind: "It takes one person eight
					days to build a wall. How many days would it take to complete
					the task if three persons worked on it?" Or the more complex
					version of this kind of problem: "Ten men and eight women
					consume a bag of wheat in five days. If women eat half as
					much as men, how many days would three men and fifteen
					women take to finish the same bag?"
				</p>
				<p>
					The idea was to simplify real-life situations to teach some
					mathematical concepts. Or else how can we just talk of so
					many men doing a task or consuming something without
					talking of the differences within all these people? This same
					logic is, however, applied in descriptions of realities, of life
					and the world of adults whenever there is any discussion
					about the issue of population.
				</p>
				<p>
					The argument is simple. The world has a finite quantity of
					resources ('x). The current population ('y') will consume
					the resources in 'z' days. But with the current rate of
					population growth ('r'), imagine how soon the world would
					run out of its resources! The logic and the presentation isso similar to what all of us have learned in our maths that the
					only possible solution appears to be reducing 'r'. Arrest
					population growth to postpone the end of the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					But pause and think if this is the reality or if a very simplified
					version of it in which the blame of the situation is being
					placed squarely on the shoulders of those who do not
					consume at the same rate but may have large numbers. The
					poor 'who breed irresponsibly' are being made scapegoats
					of in this strident plea to save the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					The statement can be reformulated to suggest an alternative
					solution. If the population increases at the rate 'r', what
					should be the rate of consumption so that the same resources
					last for 'z' days? The mathematical solution now would be
					to reduce the rate of consumption. Even if the number of
					people increased at the same rate, the resources could last
					longer if the existing people and the new additions consumed
					less. Of course, the social implications are very different,
					and these are bypassed in the debate on the population
					problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					When talking of a population policy there is no mention of
					patterns of resource consumption, of how much can be
					consumed, of issues like the vast and continuously growing
					difference in how many resources are used by whom. We do
					not even question whether everyone is consuming at the
					same rate, and has the same access and right to use them in
					the same way. There is an inherent assumption that all people
					are equivalent in their use of resources, so the stress is only
					on controlling numbers through "small families".
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The "solution" sought</h4>
				<p>
					The present population policy document goes ahead to not
					only control numbers by advocating the small family norm
					but also to ensure that those whose numbers are sought to
					be reduced do not get what is their due from the state and
					the society to survive. Those living below the poverty line
					(which itself is at a level at which survival is not possible)
					are being denied the wherewithal to survive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not granting food under the already restricted public
					distribution scheme, not allowing access to other welfare
					schemes of the government, withholding advances and
					allowances due to all employees of the State - these are
					some of the measures that are going to accomplish nothing
					but make the destitute even more so and thus automatically
					reduce their numbers even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					How much of the problem of scarcity are we going to
					address by controlling in this manner the use of resources
					by people who anyway consume even less than the
					prescribed bare minimum is a question unasked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The policy is blind to the findings of many studies all over
					the world:
				</p>
				<p>
					The cause of poverty is not too many people in the family, although poverty could be a reason for large families.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that children of the poor do not survive to live as healthy adults is one of the reasons for giving birth to more children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reduced access to basic needs would only increase the child mortality rate, especially that of the girl child.
				</p>
				<p>
					Along with cultural reasons for strong son preference, this
					practice exists in a situation in which there is welfare available
					for the older population and the son's family remains the
					only support mechanism.
				</p>
				<p>
					A policy to reduce family size by reducing access to a
					marginally better life sends the message: the "solution" to
					the current problem is to eliminate those who need help.
					Prevent the poor from being born, and prevent those already
					born, from surviving.
				</p>

				<h4>The question of medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					What is the role of the health care system, of individual
					doctors and other medical professionals in this scenario?
					According to the code of medical ethics formulated by the
					Medical Council of India <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council Of India: Code Of Medical Ethics. Declaration" id="4">(4)</a>, the principal objective of the
					medical profession is to render service to humanity with <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council Of India: Code Of Medical Ethics. Declaration" id="4">(4)</a>
					full respect for the dignity of man.
				</p>
				<p>
					The honoured ideals of the medical profession imply that
					the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to
					individuals but also to society.
				</p>
				<p>
					This means opposing draconian measures like the
					Maharashtra population policy for the good of society and
					its overall health, particularly for the health of those who are
					already marginalised and weakened by various economic
					and social forces. In a society with an ever-widening gap
					between the 'haves' and 'have nots', as welfare measures
					are curtailed, unemployment and the resulting poverty
					actually force people to give birth to more children, people
					should not be further penalised for their poverty. It is our
					responsibility to build a healthier society that looks after
					the needs of all those who constitute it.
