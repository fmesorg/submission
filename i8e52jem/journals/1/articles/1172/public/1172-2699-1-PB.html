					In recent years, the  medical community the world over has witnessed increasing emphasis being placed  on the ethics of medical practice. Both clinicians and researchers are now  expected to be aware of and work within defines ethical guidelines. For  research involving human subjects, it is becoming mandatory to get formal  approval from institutional or national ethical review  committees to ensure that ethical standards are met. This is becoming necessary  to secure funding from agencies and also for acceptance for publication in  reputed scientific journals. In the clinical setting, hospitals, patients and indeed  physicians themselves are now looking towards ethics consultation services and  hospital/clinical ethics committees to help resolve ethical and moral dilemmas  emerging in the dispensation of health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a consequence of the recent increase in its significance in  clinical practice and research, bioethics has emerged as a part of medical  education both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels through much of the  world. In Pakistan, at the Aga Khan University (AKU), Karachi, bioethics has  been a part of the undergraduate programme for over a decade. Although AKU  medical college graduates have had formal education in bioethics, the majority  of residents and faculty at this university, being graduates of other  institutions, have had no exposure to bioethics. Other health-care staff like  nurses also suffer from the same handicap.
				</p>
				<p>
					Acknowledging this deficiency, a diverse group of health care  professionals at the Aga Khan University formed the Bioethics Group (BG) in  1997. The motivating force behind the move was Dr Farhat Moazam, then professor  of surgery and the Associate Dean, Post Graduate Medical Education. For some  time, Dr Moazam had been highlighting ethical dilemmas encountered in  clinical practice. She encouraged the discussion of articles on ethical issues  in journal clubs, and brought out ethical aspects of care in morbidity and  mortality meetings and at ward rounds, thus informally raising awareness of  such issues among residents and faculty.
				</p>
				<p>
					The original Bioethics Group, with Dr Moazam as the Chair,  drew its voluntary membership from the faculty of the medical and nursing  schools. Among its founding members were a surgeon, a physician, an  anesthesiologist, a clinical psychologist, a nursing instructor, a  neonatologist and a social scientist. Four years down the line, six of the  members of the original group are still serving on the group, while a lot of  'new blood' has also been added.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group had the following broad objectives: to assist in  providing education in health-care ethics to faculty, residents and interns,  and hospital staff; to conduct research on bioethical issues, and to assist  staff faced with ethical dilemmas in the decision-making process.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group has been convening on a fairly regular basis at least  twice a month for its two-hour luncheon meetings since it first met on June 20,  1997. These meetings are used as opportunities for self development as well as  to plan activities to further the group's objectives.

				<h4>Self education</h4>
				<p>
					Since none of the members of the BG had any formal training in  bioethics, one of its priorities was, and still remains, self-education. Time  is set aside in each meeting to discuss an article or any current issue  highlighting an ethical dilemma and analysing it in light of the principles of  bioethics. At present the BG is reviewing research guidelines formulated by the  Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), keeping the  Third World perspective in mind. It is compiling a catalogue of suggested  changes to be sent to CIOMS for consideration in the guidelines' ongoing  revision. Such exercises have helped the group develop a deeper understanding  of research ethics in the context of the developing world. At a more formal  level, Dr. Moazam took a year's sabbatical in 1999 to obtain a Master's in  Bioethics at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, VA, USA.

				<h4>Ethics Grand Rounds</h4>
				<p>
					Ethics Grand Rounds are a valuable educational exercise for  highlighting the principles of bioethics and raising awareness on ethical  issues. The BG introduced the rounds at the University in 1998. 'Death with  Dignity' was the catchy title of the first Grand Round. The audience was given  an opportunity to grapple with end-of-life decision making processes and the  issues at stake in such situations in this part of the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					These Grand Rounds have become a regular feature with  participation from medical and nursing students, faculty, residents and  interns, nursing staff and the hospital administrators. The format is quite  interactive. A composite case is constructed from facts taken form an actual  clinical situation that had posed an ethical dilemma in the past. A resident  briefly presents the case to the audience. Following this presentation are  talks by two speakers, BG members or invited faculty, who take 15 minutes each  to bring out two usually conflicting views on the matter. The audience is then  invited to participate and usually an intense discussion ensues for the next  hour or so. A summation by the moderator wraps up the session. According to the  feedback received, audiences have found the case scenarios realistic and the  discussion useful and relevant. One parameter of these sessions' popularity is  the fact that various hospital departments cancel their regular teaching  sessions and meetings so that people can attend the Ethics Grand Rounds.

				<p>
					List of Bioethics Grand Rounds: March 1998: Death with dignity;  May 1998: The critically-ill neonate: a right to live; August 1998: The patient  with cancer: to disclose or not?; December 1998: Kidney for sale; March 1999:  Whose rights? confidentiality vs. the right to know; September 1999: Down's  dilemma; December 1999: Whose life is it anyway?; March 2000: Between the devil  and the deep blue sea; August 2000: Research in the developing world; March  2001: Consent: how informed is informed?; September 2001: "Doctor, please  don't tell my mother she has cancer!" The right to know vs the right to  say no.

				<h4>Newsletter</h4>
				<p>
					The BG has been publishing a newsletter since July 1998. Evolved  from a one-page photocopied version to a more formal 6-8 pager printed format,  the newsletter is circulated among the departments, faculty and staff of AKU  and also mailed to interested individuals outside the institution. It contains  news of upcoming events and reports on the BG's activities. The BG encourages  individuals to express their opinions on burning ethical issues and  controversies through the newsletter. The newsletter is funded by the Dean's  office and prepared entirely by BG members with no professional help in the  designing and publishing process. Without dedicated secretDefault Font help,  members have often found it difficult to meet publishing deadlines with the  result that the newsletter has come out rather irregularly.

				<h4>Ethics consults</h4>
				<p>
					One of the group's original objectives had been to provide advice  on moral issues encountered during patient management. As its activities became  well known, the BG found itself receiving more and more 'moral queries'. Among  the initial tasks was, and still remains, the screening out of management  issues or financial concerns which are perceived as 'ethical dilemmas'. The BG  received its first formal Ethics Consult in November 1999. This consult  concerned the management of an 18-year-old boy with Down's Syndrome,  irreversibly quadriplegic for several months and ventilator dependent. His  family wanted to disconnect him from the ventilator and take him home, while  the physician insisted that this was tantamount to murder. With no formal  experience in handling such consults, the group took on this as a challenge.  After several days of interviews and deliberations, it came up with advice that  was accepted by all parties involved in the conflict, including the family,  physician and hospital. In August 2001, a formal ethics consultation service  was started by the newly established Hospital Ethics Committee (HEC). Interestingly,  many HEC members dealing with ethics consults are also long-standing members of  the BG.

				<h4>Capacity building</h4>
				<p>
					One of the logical outcomes of BG-related activities by its  members has been the development of individual capacities in the field of  bioethics. The group has effectively become the 'resource pool' of bioethics  for the University and for other institutions as well. Several of the BG  members serve on the Hospital Ethics Committee and on the Ethical Review  Committee. The University's curriculum committee has also asked BG members to  help in the incorporation of bioethics in the problem-based learning modules.
				</p>

				<h4>Exporting bioethics</h4>
				<p>
					Other institutions have also expressed interest in developing  bioethics-related activities at their campuses in collaboration with BG. One  such institution is the Ziauddin Medical University (ZMU), Karachi. The first  combined Ethics Grand Round held at ZMU was a resounding success, and other  similar rounds are planned. BG is also interacting with ZMU to develop their  institutional guidelines for ethical research, and to establish their ERC. A  group of interested faculty is being formed at ZMU to carry on the work  independently. Similar projects are being discussed with other institutions  also.

				<h4>National guidelines for  ethical review of research on human subjects</h4>
				<p>
					The BG, along with AKU's Ethical Review Committee, organised a  workshop on ethical issues of health research in developing countries from July  22 to 27, 2001. There was close collaboration with the Harvard School of Public  Health, the Pakistan Medical Research Council (PMRC) and the Indian Council of  Medical Research. At the end of the workshop, one day was devoted to deliberate  upon forming ethical guidelines for Pakistan. A core group formed from among  the BG's members is now in the process of preparing a draft of the proposed  national guidelines which will be sent to the PMRC for nationwide circulation  and wider input. It is hoped that through this draft will emerge the national  guidelines.

				<h4>The future</h4>
				<p>
					In the four years of its existence, BG has brought about an  appreciable change in the way people look at and handle ethical issues in the  clinical setting at AKU. It has evolved and implemented educational strategies  to raise the general awareness of bioethics among students, health-care  providers and the hospital administration. Its manpower and experience have  helped establish other ethics-related committees at the institution. Finally,  it has developed linkages with other institutions in the city. Till now, the  group has developed through self-education and 'on the job training'. It is  perhaps time to consider formal training in bioethics for its members, towards  establishing an indigenous bioethics programme at AKU. At present all members  of the BG are fully employed in other clinical, administrative or academic  activities; bioethics is a voluntary activity. Perhaps in the future the BG  could have permanent as well as part-time members so that more ambitious  projects could be taken on. If the University is ready to commit itself in this  direction, the BG could in fact be a forerunner of a bioethics centre at the  AKU in the foreseeable future.
