				<h4>Ward  boys are better surgeons</h4>
				<p>
					The civic administration has ordered an inquiry into the complaint that ward  boys at Bhabha hospital, Bandra, Mumbai were suturing the wounds of patients  and administering local anaesthesia with the full knowledge of doctors. Dr  Shirish Borkar had taken his carpenter to the hospital for treatment where he  was shocked to see a ward boy suture the head wounds of another patient. The  medical officer on duty told Dr Borkar that the ward boy would, in fact, do a  better job than a doctor.

				<h4>Touts  in the morgue</h4>
				<p>
					At Mumbai's busiest morgue in JJ Hospital, the grief of families struggling for  the release of their loved ones' bodies is a goldmine for gangs of touts.  Families waiting for bodies towards the end of the day, when doctors stop  performing postmortems, are told that they can get the bodies released if they  pay Rs 4,000&mdash;or wait till the next day. The touts say they must pay Rs 1,000 to  doctors to deal with the bodies urgently, Rs 400 to the person who sews up the  body and the rest to various other people to expedite the procedure. The dean  of the hospital said the touts are not linked to the hospital.

				<h4>Public  relations</h4>
				<p>
					When a  Mumbai surgeon recently imported a state-of-the-art machine, he hired a public  relations agency, which drummed up the needed media coverage for Rs 50,000.
				</p>
				<p>
					Public  relations agencies say that the number of doctors on their client rolls has  increased sharply. Doctors pay between Rs 25,000 and several lakh for services  ranging from printing brochures to managing national campaigns. But it is a  small charge for specialists when the investment bears returns.

				<h4>AIDS  patient treated badly</h4>
				<p>
					A doctor at Mumbai's Cooper Hospital slapped and abused a patient after he  discovered she was HIV positive. Two days later, the patient died of medical  complications.
				</p>
				<p>
					'I  agree that there are many hospitals which treat patients shabbily and we are  trying to create more awareness amongst doctors and the class 4 staff, but  things are much better than what they used to be a few years ago,' said Dr Alka  Gogte, Director, Maharashtra District AIDS control society.

				<h4>Accused  doctors surrender</h4>
				<p>
					Two medical practitioners who had been absconding after being accused in the  Bilkis Bano gang rape and massacre during the Gujarat violence surrendered  before the chief judicial magistrate of Ahmedabad. Dr Arun Kumar and his wife  Dr Sangeeta Prasad were found guilty of not conducting proper medical and  postmortem tests on the rape and murder victims. The Central Bureau of  Investigation found that they did not even bother to take the victims to the  hospital for the postmortem and 'haphazardly conducted the tests at the scene  of crime'.

				<h4>Practice  without a degree</h4>
				<p>
					A survey on health care in Udaipur, Rajasthan, found that 41% of those in the  private sector had no medical degree, 18% had no medical or paramedical  training at all and 17% had not even graduated from high school. In private  clinics or practices, 68% of patients were given an injection and 12% were  given a drip compared with 32% and 6% in public facilities, respectively. On an  average 45% of medical or paramedical personnel were absent from government run  sub-centres and 36% were absent from primary health centres. The sub-centres  were closed 56% of the time during their regular opening hours, discouraging  people from walking an average of 1.4 miles from their village.
				</p>
				<p>
					'These  data paint a fairly bleak picture: villagers' health is poor; the quality of  public service is abysmal; private providers&mdash;unregulated and for the most part  unqualified&mdash;provide the bulk of health care in the area,' say the researchers.

				<h4>Petition  against OTC sale of mifepristone</h4>
				<p>
					The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission directed the state government to  stop over-the-counter sale of mifepristone on the grounds that it violated the  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act. The commission asked the government  to ensure that the drugs were dispensed only on the prescription of doctors  authorised to conduct MTPs and working at centres approved by the Director of  Health Services. It also asked the government to prosecute drug manufacturers,  medical practitioners and retailers violating the law.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  commission's orders were in response to a petition filed by Dr S G Kabra who  pointed out that the pills were freely sold over the counter. The State Drug  Controller admitted that drug shops in Kota, Banswara and Jhalawar were found  selling mifepristone without the prescription of a gynaecologist. The  commission also took note of Dr Kabra's assertion that criminal interference  with women's bodies was not recorded or reported when they were treated for  life-threatening complications in regular hospitals after the drug was  administered.

				<h4>Need  to document evidence of torture</h4>
				<p>
					The need to properly document evidence of torture was highlighted at a training  programme for medical practitioners organised by the Indian Medical Association  and the Torture Prevention Centre, India, in Kochi.
				</p>
				<p>
					K  Narayana Kurup, former acting chief justice of the Madras High Court, told  doctors that honestly recording their findings of injury in postmortem findings  would assist courts in arriving at the truth in custodial crime. Some members  of the medical profession were not up to the standards expected of them in  giving true postmortem certificates and recording injuries inflicted on the  victim.
				</p>
				<p>
					S D  Singh, Honorary Director of the Torture Prevention Centre, India, said health  professionals could be a link between the needs of the victims and the legal  system.
				</p>
				<p>
					A panel  discussion on 'Examination of torture victims and diagnosis' and 'Treatment  management of torture victims and medical testimonials' was held on the  occasion.

				<h4>Call  to relax clinical trial regulation</h4>

					Drug companies are pressuring the Indian government to relax regulations on  clinical trials to capture lucrative outsourcing contracts from the West.

					The  Confederation of Indian Industries is calling for 'automatic approvals of all  phases of clinical trials', if applications are not cleared within a stipulated  time frame.

				<h4>IMA  call to legalise off-label prescription</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Medical Association has sought legislative changes allowing doctors  to make off-label prescriptions of drugs 'as long as unflinching medical  literature has given them confidence for such therapy'. 'Doctors write  off-label prescriptions in the best interest of patients, but they have a  responsibility to interpret information received from any source before making  clinical decisions,' the association said. Amendments to the Indian Medical  Council Act two years ago made off-label prescribing illegal.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  controversy over off-label use of drugs grew after a drug company was accused  of promoting the anti-cancer drug letrozole for the treatment of infertility in women.

				<h4>Demand  for right to health care</h4>

					The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a coalition of voluntary organisations, has urged  political parties to support its demand for a National Public Health Act, codifying  right to health.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  present, India spends about 0·9% of its gross domestic product on health care,  compared to the average of 2·8% spent by some less developed countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to a World Bank study published in January 2004, nearly 82% of all health  spending in India is private. It also pointed to health inequities such as the  poorest 20% getting only 10% of subsidies, while the richest 20% capture 33%.

				<h4>Nepal  cabinet passes a directive on abortions</h4>
				<p>
					Maya Thakuri died of abortion-related complications three months before the  Nepal cabinet passed a directive laying out conditions under which hospitals  can perform abortions. This follows on a two-year-old law that makes abortions  legal in certain situations. Under the new directive, only registered medical  institutions and doctors with valid licenses can perform abortions which can  only be done with the woman's consent, and only if the foetus is less than 12 weeks  old. In cases of incest and rape, abortions are allowed up to 18 weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Till  the directives are finalised, the regulations enforced and the law followed,  women's rights activists say, there will be more unnecessary deaths of women  like Maya in under-equipped and clandestine clinics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women  in urban areas have always had access to safe abortion, without the fear of  criminal sanction. As they can afford it, they get discreet and safe medical  attention.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although  specialists say sex-selective abortions are not as common in Nepal as in China  or India, it is a growing phenomenon and could be one of the unforeseen  consequences of partial legalisation of abortion without proper guidelines and  enforcement.

				<h4>Fake  homeopaths in Pakistan</h4>
				<p>
					The increasing number of fake homoeopath doctors in North West Frontier  Province is of concern. About 200 clinics operate in Peshawar city alone. These  unauthorised 'clinicians' lure patients through stickers pasted on walls and in  buses, offering guaranteed treatment for all sort of ailments at an affordable  cost. They get their degrees from privately-run institutions which lack  classes, qualified teachers, proper courses, laboratories and other  infrastructure required in a medical college.

				<h4>Pakistan  petition calling for a ban on the organ trade</h4>
				<p>
					A fresh petition seeking a legislative ban on the sale and purchase of kidneys  and other human organs was moved with the Lahore High Court.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advocate  M D Tahir had filed a petition in 2002 referring to the sale of kidneys by  about 400 people of Kot Momin in Bhalwal. He had submitted that villagers were  operated upon at a private hospital in Rawalpindi and paid Rs 40,000 each. Each  kidney was later sold for Rs 400,000. The court directed the Punjab government  to submit a reply to the contents of petition. The petition is still pending.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his  new petition, Mr Tahir has stated that the trade in human body parts,  particularly kidneys, has spread to Mianwali, Vehari, Faisalabad, Sheikhupura,  Hafizabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore where a mafia of doctors and their agents is  engaged in buying kidneys from the poor for a low price and selling them to the  affluent at exorbitant prices. He stated that the mafia had developed contacts  abroad and rich people from other countries were paying exorbitant prices for  kidneys. The petitioner said members of the National Assembly and the Punjab  legislature were maintaining a criminal silence over this inhuman trade.

				<h4>Pakistan:  syringe re-use to inject cows</h4>
				<p>
					A letter to The <em>Lancet</em> from Pakistan comments on the widespread practice of  health care workers circulating used syringes for re-use to inject cows with  oxytoxin. This puts all those handling the used syringes at risk of blood-borne  infections such as HIV and HBV. The writers urge WHO, UNICEF, and the  Government of Pakistan to take immediate steps to educate health care workers  and the general public about the dangers of uch practices.&nbsp;

				<h4>US  doctors and execution</h4>
				<p>
					Dr Sanjeeva Rao used to look after the inmates at a US state prison. After the  state started using lethal injections in 2000, he monitors and helps execute  the process. If the prisoner's heart monitor does not flatline after the  injections are given, Dr Rao orders for more poison.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some  critics say that doctors who participate in executions violate the most  fundamental tenet of medical ethics, while others say that lethal injections,  the almost universal form of execution in the US, can be performed humanely  only by medical professionals. About 25 US states allow or require doctors to  be present at executions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  American Medical Association's ethics code says that 'a physician, as a member  of a profession dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so,  should not be a participant in a legally authorised execution,' forbidding  prescribing drugs, supervising prison personnel, selecting intravenous sites,  placing intravenous lines, administering injections and pronouncing death.  However, a survey found that more than 40% of doctors would be willing to  perform at least one of the forbidden activities.
