				<h4>Ethics and morals in India's immunisation programme</h4>
				<p>
					The national project of paediatric vaccination has been  													interrogated from various ethical standpoints. However, as  													the authors of this study point out, most of those ethical  													deliberations have focused on ways to develop more  													appropriate and context-sensitive measures for interventions,  													and have critiqued the healthcare provider's utilitarian  													relationship with the client.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this article, the authors present the findings of a qualitative  													study that mapped the ethical notions of care providers, and  													also the moral values that govern the outlook of parents. The  													study was conducted in select areas in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  													Given the heightened awareness among parents about the  													process and consequence of immunisation, these two higher  													literacy states have had episodes of resistance to state-driven  													vaccination programmes. While the media has had a role to play  													in making vaccine-induced mishaps part of public knowledge,  													people were also seen to stay away from vaccination on the  													advice of their general practitioners and practitioners of  													alternative systems of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors noted in this study that among the authorities  													interviewed, there was a high moral tone attached to the  													process of immunisation. The intensity with which universal  													immunisation was vouched for was often seen to outweigh  													the necessity of taking proper consent from the parents. In  													fact, for several healthcare workers, consent was equivalent  													to a disruption of the process and needed to be done away  													with. The fact that the workers were severely chastised by  													their departmental seniors if vaccination targets were not met  													also played a part in making the immunisation drive more  													aggressive. When parental consent was taken, it was done so  													only to avoid any legal complications in the future, and not  													because of any ethical imperative on the part of the healthcare  													worker. Parents were seen to accept the overtly paternalistic  													roles of the caregivers. Some parents were seen to 'give in' to  													vaccinations because all others in their neighbourhood had  													done so, since nobody wanted to be a deviant. Caregivers were  													also seen to play up this aspect; hesitant parents were told that  													they owed this to their children and they would be blamed by  													the children later if they were not vaccinated.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors explore a critical area in the area of   paediatric  													immunisation and methodically document how societalparental  													moral views work alongside the ethical notions of  													caregivers to make an immunisation programme succeed or  													fail. Given India's thrust towards paediatric immunisation,   this study offers valuable insights into the politics of ethics at work  													in this space.

				<h4>Patient privacy and confidentiality in crowded hospital emergency rooms</h4>
				<p>
					Respecting the privacy of patients and ensuring confidentiality  													are regarded as essential obligations of healthcare institutions.  													However, almost no hospital has private or semi-private  													sections in its emergency departments. Consequently, patients  													who are admitted here stand the highest risk of having their  													privacy compromised. This article presents the results of a  													study designed to understand how patient privacy and overall  													patient satisfaction can be bettered in hospital emergency  													departments. As part of the intervention, the emergency  													department staff was oriented towards coping with the  													situation within the given resources.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study was conducted in the emergency department of a  													hospital attached to an urban academic medical college in  													a country in South East Asia. It was crowded and chaotic, and  													many patients were treated in the hallway since beds were  													always full. The interview schedule attempted to understand  													patients' perspectives on physical privacy, informational privacy,  													decisional privacy and proprietary privacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					After the interventions, there was a significant positive  													difference in the reporting of patients regarding their  													perception of privacy and confidentiality in the emergency  													department. The authors conclude by listing the factors that  													can work towards making the emergency department/room a  													patient-sensitive place: a well-planned re-organisation of the  													physical space of the emergency room, sharing of responsibility  													by the management towards ensuring these changes, bioethics  													training of staff, and ethics consultations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors cite several other studies which have also   shown  													how redesigning of physical spaces can increase the sense  													of privacy of patients. Small efforts like separating each   bed  													with a curtain can also have a positive impact on the   patient.  													Similarly, mandatory use of a low tone when discussing  													treatment options or informing the patient of the   diagnosis/  													prognosis, avoiding taking a patient's history when other   patients are close by, not discussing medical cases in corridors,  													and not shouting instructions to nurses, were seen to add   up  													to a significant positive difference. The authors end by   asking  													institutions to emphasise patient-centred healthcare as a   top  													priority and to invest in building an ethical environment   and  													climate to improve the quality of care in emergency wards.
				</p>
				<p>
					The scenario of crowded hospitals and mismanaged  													emergency rooms is overwhelmingly familiar in India. This  													study can throw light on how we could become more sensitive  													to patients' needs even while keeping in mind the limited  													resources available in an emergency room.

				<h4>The ethics of designing paediatric consent forms</h4>
				<p>
					As full, conscious and voluntary informed consent of a research  													participant is accorded utmost primacy, the 'consent' of a child  													is an even more sensitive and complex issue. In most cases,  													the parent is the authorised guardian to consent on the child's  													behalf; however, ethics should inform the design of a child's  													assent form, drafting withdrawal clauses and sharing the child's  													data with the parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this study, 65 assent and consent forms exclusively for  													paediatric research were reviewed to find the gap areas  													and suggest best practices. Based on the findings, the  													authors suggest that in longitudinal and biobanking studies,  													researchers should re-contact children once they have matured  													and take their consent for the continuation of use of their data;  													other genres of studies could do with a 'broad consent' of  													the parents. Coding data rather than anonymising it is always  													better since it allows one to contact a participant at a later  													stage, if ever deemed necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors note that conflict in withdrawing from a study is  													also a serious area of concern. The question is: who decides to  													withdraw? Consent forms should clearly state whether, when a  													participant withdraws, they would consider the decision of the  													mature child (even if it is opposed to what the parents want)  													as final; or whether only the decision of the parent (irrespective  													of what the child wants). Also, forms should make clear what  													happens if participants want to withdraw and not have their  													data used<em> after</em> the data has been anonymised.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was found that, in several cases, the research team promised  													parents access to part or whole of the child's data and also the  													results of future routine tests. This posed an ethical problem.  													For instance a child might not want her parents to know the  													results of her pregnancy test or drug use. Researchers should  													think through such issues and, if needed, take the assent of  													mature children before sharing their data with their parents,  													and this should be clearly mentioned to the parents at the start of the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study was designed to develop certain best practices in  													designing consent and assent forms. It also sought to orient  													researchers to think through these issues in a nuanced manner,  													and to not treat everybody under the age of 18 as incompetent  													and lacking in autonomy. The authors conclude with the appeal  													that best practices can improve consent forms and facilitate  													context-based approaches to ethical norms in paediatric  													research.

				<h4>Effectiveness and ethics of physician incentives</h4>
				<p>
					There are managerial and ethical issues to tackle when it comes  													to physician incentives. While the former largely concern the  													effectiveness of the incentive system, ethical concerns primarily  													revolve around the issue of professional ethics and how  													incentives may unduly influence a physician while treating the  													patient, and lead to over- or under -provision of services.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors state that financial as well as non-financial  													incentives play a role in the healthcare system and the  													management should balance the incentives in such a way  													that maximum benefits accrue to patients, institutions and  													doctors. They refer to Max Weber's description of four types  													of incentives -- traditional, self interest, affective and shared  													purpose -- and suggest that these can be used to explain  													incentives in the healthcare system as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the traditional approach. physicians may find it an incentive  													that they get to work in an organisation and be part of a  													group and its tradition. Financial incentives focus chiefly on  													self interest and should be used with caution as they have  													tremendous potential to introduce conflicts of interest and  													undermine trust in the physician-patient relationship. Affective  													incentives are useful in situations where physicians work  													as a community and where peer pressure can be effective  													in motivating them to perform better. The flip side of this  													approach is that too much peer pressure can have an adverse  													effect on physicians. The shared purpose approach is based on  													the goals of the healthcare organisation being in alignment  													with the physicians' sense of purpose. The success of this model  													depends on how incentives can be formulated in a framework  													where the hospitals' goals of good patient outcomes, better  													population health, and reduced costs are in tandem with  													the physicians' goals of patient welfare, autonomy and social  													justice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors argue that the shared purpose model works  													better than the traditional, affective or self interest   models.  													It promotes the sense of ethics, responsibility and moral  													agency among physicians, as they identify with the   incentives  													system, rather than it being imposed on them. Even the   shared purpose approach needs to be integrated judiciously with the  													other approaches, depending on the history and culture of   the  													organisation, and the context in which the incentive system   is  													being implemented.

				<h4>The open access debate</h4>
				<p>
					The production and distribution of scholarly work through  													peer reviewed journals is not a simple business. There are  													multiple stakeholders involved, ranging from the funding  													agencies donating money for the research, the universities  													and organisations that support the researchers and produce  													a conducive environment for research, the authors of articles,  													the publishing houses bringing out journals, and the libraries  													which purchase, organise and store these articles for research  													and teaching purposes. The widespread use of the Internet and  													digital publishing altered the stability of the system, and as a  													result, publishing houses started experimenting and developed  													a business model of digital rights management, restricting  													access to only those who could afford to pay for articles.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this debate, Wolpert argues that restricted access  													undermines the very purpose of research. The limited access  													policy has not only affected readers but also the   researchers  													or authors whose primary intention of publishing is to be  													widely read and quoted -- for their research findings to be  													disseminated. Both government agencies and charitable  													foundations want the research built on their investments to  													be widely accessible and not just limited to a few. This   has led  													them to look out for alternate avenues of publications such   as  													open access databases and open repositories of peer   reviewed  													articles. Models of revenue generation such as payment  													of a publication fee by the authors, and research grants or  													institutions financially supporting the publishing of   journals, are also being tried out. The author refers to the Bethesda  													Statement on Open Access Publishing to note that the   tradition  													of researchers publishing their work without expectation of  													financial gain, and the new technology of the World Wide   Web  													and Internet will make open access a reality in the near   future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Presenting the opposing view, Haug looks at the downside of  													free and "rampant" open access publishing. The author discusses  													the "author pay" model in which authors pay to get their  													articles published in journals. She refers to unethical practices  													by publishing houses, fuelled by the pay-for-publishing  													model. For example, publishers may claim to have a peer  													review process without having one; they may not preserve the  													digital archives, and they may lower the standards of scientific  													publications while not adding to scientific knowledge. The  													author acknowledges that this system allows authors who are  													not able to publish in the highest ranking journals to publish  													their research. However, the author is disturbed by the fact that  													many such publishing houses which are nothing more than  													"online posting services" that have undermined the meaning of  													the terms "international", "scientific" and "peer reviewed" journal.  													The author cites the example of Elsevier that had published six  													"fake journals" sponsored by pharmaceutical companies which  													were made to look like journals. She reaffirms the significance  													of transparency in the publishing business so that readers  													are assured of the quality, significance and originality of the  													research they read.
