				<p>
					The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA), attempting to enforce the  ruling by the Supreme Court, issued an order in the end of December 1996  prohibiting the pharmaceutical trade from honouring prescriptions from doctors registered  under one discipline including drugs from any other discipline. The FDA has  also warned members of the pharmaceutical trade that any violation of the order  would invite prosecution under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and/or the  Indian Penal Code.
				</p>
				<p>
					The FDA in Gujarat was the first to issue such orders. The  health department, Government of Gujarat, has banned the practice of different  forms of medicine by any doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra health secretariat is under pressure to  implement a similar ban but fears an immediate collapse of its primary health  centres where 25% of the doctors have trained in ayurveda. As doctors with MBBS  are reluctant to go to rural and tribal areas, the state government has  downgraded some class II posts in tribal areas and appointed class III  ayurvedic doctors. These doctors are given short-term crash courses in  pharmacology before they are allowed to man their centres.

				<p>
					The Press Guwahati (PTI) transmitted this report on 2 December 1996: In a volte  face, controversial heart surgeon Dhani Ram Baruah, who claimed to have  transplanted a pig's heart to a human being on December 15 here, today denied  the transplantation saying he only repaired two holes in the patient's heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					Official sources, quoting the doctor, said today as the holes  were repaired Dr Baruah did not have too use the animal's heart as planned  earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the inquiry committee appointed by the Assam  government to look into the controversy, today visited the Dr Baruah Heart  Institute and Research Centre at Sonapur near here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though the doctor initially fended off the investigators, he  relented when told the team was accompanied by a magistrate.
				</p>
				<p>
					On December 18, the hospital staff did not allow the inquiry  committee into the hospital. Dr Baruah also refused to meet it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Incidentally, apart from personally telling journalists that he  did transplant the pig's heart, Dr Baruah had claimed the same in a television  interview. He has invited the local medical fraternity to challenge him at the  world conference of heart surgeons in Barcelona, Spain, in July, according to a  local English daily, <em>The  North-East Times,</em> today. He told the paper over telephone yesterday he  planned to present his patient, Mr Purna Saikia (32), along with his papers in  Barcelona if he was fit by then.
			  </p>
				<p>
					Reacting to the doubts over the authenticity of his claim, the  doctor said he could keep an isolated heart of an animal beating for hours in  his laboratory.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, the patient's relatives complained to journalists  they were not being allowed to either see him nor enter the hospital premises.

				<p>
					Amidst a raging controversy in medical and lay circles, the  Assam government has ordered an official inquiry into whether a pig's heart was  actually transplanted into a human being at a hospital near Guwahati last  Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>
					The so-called 'unique surgical feat' was claimed to have been  carried out successfully by Dr Dhaniram Baruah assisted by a team of 16 doctors  including two veterinary surgeons at his heart institute and research centre  located at Sonapur, about 25 km from Guwahati. The patient was one Puna Saikia  (32) from Golaghat.
				</p>
				<p>
					What made the event highly suspect in the eyes of most of the  medical fraternity as well as the local media was that Dr Dhaniram Baruah had  rung up newspapers and news agencies well before the operation asking for  reporters and photographers to be present to record the 'historic feat.'
				</p>
				<p>
					While most of the media expressed scepticism given the elementary state of cardiac facilities available in the northeastern region,  two local newspapers made a media circus out of the so-called transplant  operation.
			  </p>
				<p>
					These two newspapers not only published 'curtain raisers'  boosting Dr. Baruah a day before the operation but also published photographs  of the patient and the pig on the operating table while the surgical procedure  was being carried out. Pictures of the patient recovering after surgery were  also published.
				</p>
				<p>
					The published accounts, however, did not make it clear whether a  pig's heart was actually transplanted into the patient. It would appear that  what was actually performed was an operation to repair a hole in the heart  ventricle. Dr Baruah himself and other doctors associated with the so-called  'transplant' would give only evasive replies to media queries after the first  reports were published by the two newspapers.
				</p>
				<p>
					What made matters worse was that a national news agency picked  up the reports in the local newspapers and circulated them both nationally and  internationally.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rival newspapers quoting other cardiac specialists here termed  the 'pig-to-man' heart transplant operation a hoax and fraud. Dr Baruah had  earlier received much all-India publicity by claiming to have invented a new type  of heart valve and an artificial heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was also in the news last August for confining three  engineers of a medical equipment company at gunpoint in his heart institute  demanding compensation of Rs. 8.5 lakh for allegedly supplying defective  equipment. Following a complaint by the company, police obtained an arrest  warrant for Dr. Baruah who obtained anticipatory bail. He was chargesheeted in  the case at the end of November.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reputed cardiologists here have termed Dr Baruah's claim of  having transplanted a pig's heart into a man as a hoax and a publicity stunt.
				</p>
				<p>
					"In the entire north-eastern region there are no  facilities even to carry out an angiogram. Patients have to travel to Delhi or  Madras for a heart by-pass operation. How can this man claim to have  transplanted a pig's heart into a man? What facilities does he have in his  institute?" asked an eminent cardiologist.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Such claims give a bad name to the medical profession as a  whole and Indian scientists in particular," said Dr. A. K. Baruah, Principal  of the Guwahati Medical College and himself an eminent cardiologist. "This  is nothing but a publicity stunt." Several other cardiac specialists  expressed similar views, some even questioning Dr. Dhaniram Baruah's  professional credentials.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, the news of the pig-to-man transplant came out  even as it was reported that the British government had put off the first  scheduled transplants of pig organs into human beings for fear of animal  viruses being carried over into humans. Alarmed by the uproar over the whole  affair, the Assam Government ordered an enquiry into whether a pig's heart was  actually transplanted into a human being.
				</p>
				<p>
					The enquiry committee, comprising Dr. Ramesh Verma, joint  director of health K. N. Das and Professor of Cardiology B. K. Das of the  Guwahati Medical College, visited the Dhaniram Baruah Heart Institute and  Research Centre on Wednesday to begin their investigation.
				</p>
				<p>
					They were denied entry at the gate. Dr Baruah and other doctors  at the institute also refused to meet the enquiry team saying they were too  busy attending to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Baruah has also threatened to slap a Rs. 50 crore suit  against the national news agency concerned for allegedly 'misreporting' the  surgical procedure carried out. The agency, however, says it had reported on  the basis of a press release issued by Dr. Baruah.

				<p>
					It is as if it had never happened. Called a fraud by the State Government,  Dhani Ram Baruah withdrew his fantastic claim that he had 'successfully  transplanted the heart of a pig in a man'. Today, barely a fortnight after the  outcry died down, the doctor is back to his experiments.
				</p>
				<p>
					His guinea pig is 32-year-old Purna Saikia; whom he advertised  as the recipient of a pig's heart. Today, Saikia lies unconscious in 'Heart  City', Baruah's heart care centre at Sonapur, 20 km from Guwahati. Baruah has  got the family to sign another 'bond' which permits him to perform a second  transplant of a pig's heart.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to his relatives, Purna was quite hale and hearty  before the mysterious 12-hour operation that Baruah conducted on 15 December.  "On 15 December, we were treated to a meal of pork and rice," recalls  Someshwar. "The hospital cook told us the meat was from the pig killed for  the heart."
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, Saikia's family is worried. "On 21 December we were  informed that his condition had become serious and that he had lost  consciousness. We have not been permitted to see him again," says  Someshwar, Purna's eldest brother.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Saikias are middle-class farmers from Golaghat in Upper  Assam. Purna is the third of five brothers. Afflicted with a congenital heart  problem, he seems to have been the victim of typical apathy with which doctors  regard poor patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was a newspaper advertisement which drew the Saikias to  'Heart City'. "After a preliminary check-up, Baruah admitted him and a  few days later we signed the first bond for the operation," says Prafulla  Gogoi, a relative. Curiously, Baruah did not think it necessary to explain to the  Saikias what a 'pig heart transplant' meant.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Saikias say they paid Baruah Rs. 1, 00,000 for the  operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite several attempts Baruah could not be contacted. His  hospital is heavilv guarded and no outsider is allowed access.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health Minister Kamla Kalita, in his statement to the State  Assembly, said on 23 December that the Government 'was examining all legal  possibilities so that adequate action can be taken against him for trying to  sansationalise the issue'.

					Three doctors who had claimed to have transplanted pigs organs in a patient  were arrested late on Thursday (9 January) night. The doctors, Dhani Ram  Baruah, Jonathan Ho and C. J. James, were produced before the court of the  chief judicial magistrate of Kamrup on Friday where their bail pleas were  rejected.

					Counsel for Dr. Baruah said that his (Dr. Baruah's) action was  not covered by the organ transplantation act as it covered human organs while  in this case, pig's organs were involved. The transplantation was done in good  faith and the consent of the relatives of the patient was obtained.
				</p>
				<p>

				<p>
					Talking to the reporter from <em>India Today</em> after  transplanting a pig's heart into Purna Saikia, Dr. Dhani Ram Baruah said,  "Medical science has taken a giant leap forward." Baruah claimed he  used a secret solution of chemicals that blinds the immune system. Saikia's  heart was treated with the magic solution for 30 minutes, washed and then  implanted in the 15 hour operation, Baruah explained. Baruah disowned a  subsequent statement which said that he had transplanted a pig's heart, stating  that the confession was signed only because they threatened to close down his  hospital if he did not do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>India Today</em> learned that Drs. Baruah and Ho have  achieved infamy in the past. They implanted heart valves made of animal tissue - developed by Dr. Baruah - in 12 patients in Hong Kong in 1992. A year later  six patients died. The <em>Asian  Medical News</em> reported  that 'grave concerns were expressed over the the implantation'.
			  </p>
				<p>
					When Dr. Baruah was asked about the ethics of his  transplantation of the pig's heart, he said angrily: "To hell with  controversies. I will go ahead with what I am supposed to do."

				<p>
					The death of 32-year-old Purna Saikia following a controversial pig-to-man  heart, kidney and lungs transplant surgery done by Dr. Dhani Ram Baruah along  with his associates Dr. Jonathan Ho of the Hong Kong-based Prince of Wales  Medical Institute and Dr. C. S. James, raises the basic issues of public  morality, professional ethics and the challenges facing law enforcement agencies  in a fast changing technological environment. Dr. Baruah and his colleagues  have since been arrested by the local police for alleged violation of the  Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. Findings of the postmortem done on  the body of Saikia by a medical team are not available yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					The veracity of Dr. Baruah's claim that the patient died a week  after the operation can be proved only by the post-mortem results. Dr. Baruah  has also claimed that he had the consent of the patient for the pig heart transplant  but this does not absolve him of the responsibility for the serious  consequences of the surgery which was plainly illegal as the law does not  permit transplantation of an animal organ in a human being. On his part, Dr.  Baruah has asserted that the operation was not only successful but also unique  and that the patient had responded to the treatment well. He has attributed  Saikia's death to secondary causes arising from infection. The public uproar  over Saikia's death has predictably caused much embarrassment to the Government  and the State Health Minister has even suspected 'fraud' on the part of the  doctor in performing the operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The episode has naturally attracted worldwide attention for  obvious reasons. As the eminent cardiac surgeon, who is heading the Madras  Medical Mission, Dr. K. M. Cherian, says, lack of transparency on the part of  medical professionals in conducting new experiments could pose a serious threat  to public health. A North American organisation planned to undertake transplantation  with transgenic pigs, but according to the latest information, it has postponed  the experiment. The acceptance of the animal organ by the human body is yet to  be fully established.
				</p>
				<p>
					In view of the revolutionary strides made in cadaver  transplantation and cardiac surgery, controversial experiments should be  overseen by a technical committee of specialists to ensure that the law is not  violated. Professional and government-run institutions should also be vigilant  in protecting the public interest by taking penal action against unscrupulous  and misguided professionals. Political intervention to protect the guilty can  only harm the medical profession. The Guwahati episode should be an eye-opener  as the legal and ethical issues it raises need to be addressed by the  specialists and the authorities. The future of transplant surgery hinges on the  response of the professional and government agencies in guiding its development  on the right course.

				<p>
					After being released on bail, Dr. Dhani Ram Baruah claimed he  would prove his achievement before the international medical community. Dr.  Baruah said Puma Saikia had died seven days after the transplant operation due  to bacterial infection he had acquired earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					He announced his plans to travel to Barcelona and Sydney to  present his achievements before cardiac surgeons. He claimed that his success  lay in preventing hyperacute rejection of the pig organs using his antigen-suppressing agent. He felt that his experiments with xenotransplantation should  not stop just because there were chances of infectious disease being  transferred to the patient. "If any unknown virus is transferred to human  beings from pigs, the virologist can take care of it," he stated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Baruah alleged that there was an international consipracy to  undermine his achievement. He said he would seek the permission of the Indian  Medical Council to perform more such operations.

				<p>
					Three-and-a-half-year-old Altamash Shaikh swallowed a 50-paise coin whilst playing with his friends. His parents panicked although  Altamash did not complain of any uneasiness. They rushed him to a general  practitioner who advised an x-ray. Following his advice, he took him to the  Linkway Nursing Home and Polyclinic situated at Link Road, Behrambaug  (Jogeshwari, Mumbai) and approached Dr. Amar Singh in the x-ray department.  The report confirmed that there was a coin in the stomach. "We were very  concerned," said Altamash's father, Akbar. Shehnaz, Altamash's mother,  says she asked Dr. Singh whether giving their son bananas or an enema would  help bring the coin out. He turned down their suggestion and insisted they go  in for endoscopy. The parents hadn't yet decided what to do and were still waiting  for their relatives to advise them when Dr. Shankar Sawant went ahead with the  procedure. Dr. Renuka Anvekar anaesthetised their son after coercing them to  consent, say the Shaikhs.
				</p>
				<p>

				<p>
					Medical authorities have warned a private eye hospital in Hyderabad where  doctors were using students of a local blind school as guinea pigs in  transplant surgery, ostensibly to restore their sight.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) directed the L V  Prasad Eye Institute to stop further experiments on the blind which it says are  in violation of ethical guidelines for experimenting on humans.
				</p>
				<p>
					The institute has so far used eight blind boys in an experiment  to find out if injecting brains cells of aborted foetuses into the retina  restored their sight that was lost due to a progressive disease called  retinitis pigmentosa. The doctors claimed to have obtained clearance from a  local ethical committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					While there is no documented evidence of any of the boys  regaining their sight, the doctors wanted to try this technique on 20 more  patients when ICMR put a stop to the project.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Institute carried out its project in collaboration with some  institutions in the United States where such experiments involving foetal cells  are not permitted. India, incidentally, has no law governing the use of foetal  cells for research.
				</p>
				<p>
					According Dr Tara Prasad Das who performed the transplant, 14-week-old foetuses needed for the experiment were made available by the  Government Maternity Hospital in Hyderabad.
				</p>
				<p>
					The experiment involved extracting the neural cells of the foetus  and introducing these behind the retina of blind persons through tiny holes  made in their eye balls. The idea was that growing neural cells would replace  the defective retinal cells of the patient, resulting in restoration of vision.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not known if animal studies were ever done and whether  animal data had compelling evidence to warrant human trial, an ICMR official  said. It is also not known how the institute obtained the mandatory consent of  the patients who cannot see what they sign.
				</p>
				<p>
					The L V Prasad Eye Institute had earlier been in trouble over  export of blood samples of its patients to an American agency under the garb of  foreign collaboration. These exports, which were without official permission,  were also stopped by ICMR which is the nodal agency for clearance of any  foreign collaboration involving transfer of human material.

				<p>
					In a statement issued to clarify its stand on an experiment  being conducted on the blind by the L V Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) in  Hyderabad with the US assistance, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)  said such trials were not ethical and similar experiments would not have been  allowed in the US.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Hyderabad institute was recently in the news for conducting  tests on several patients affected by retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary  disease, using a new clinical method where foetal tissues were used for  transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ICMR said however, that it does not have the authority to  stop an experiment, unless it funds or sponsors the project. "The Council  came into the picture only when the Institute submitted a new research proposal  for financial support under the Indo-US collaborative programme," the  statement said.
				</p>
				<p>
					All international/joint research proposals that ICMR get is  first examined by technical experts or subject specialists and finally by a  high-powered committee under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The  proposal by LVPEI was considered by the high-powered committee, but not  approved on the grounds that '.. .undertaking such clinical trials on Indian  subjects for an experimental procedure which was not being carried out on the  US subjects was not ethical and hence not acceptable.' This decision was later  communicated to the principal investigator of the proposal.

				<p>
					The physician-patient relationship has undergone a massive  change. No longer is a patient treated with care and compassion by the  physician despite the astronomical increase in the consulting fee. For the doctor,  the patient is just another nameless person to be subjected to a series of  queries and tests.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is indeed a pity that most doctors have forgotten their  primary responsibility towards the patient. The sacred trust reposed by the  sick and helpless patient in the doctor is commercially exploited to the hilt  by the entire system of medical practitioners, diagnostic professionals,  surgeons, nursing staff and others. Most in the medical profession are just  interested in acquiring wealth at the cost of the ignorant patients. In this  pursuit the physician is least bothered if the patient is put to needless  surgical and diagnostic procedures and 'therapeutic overprescription.
				</p>
				<p>
					These practices have alienated the doctor from the patient who  now views this 'unsympathetic group as one to be visited only in desperation'.

					Bravo to the M. P. government for stopping the private practice of medical  doctors in cities. But let us see how long the government can and really  sustain it or the situation will deteriorate to having the cake and eating it  too when the medical doctors in cities will earn with their salary the 'non-practising allowance' (which should be stopped anyhow) and have (illegal)  private practice secretly. Or the medical doctors will just 'feed' the authori  ties and politicians and get the decision reversed. But I really want to dispel  the following delusion in the mind of some that 'this... would lead to an  exodus of talent from the ranks of government doctors' (as said by the  President of the Government Doctors' Association -- who else -- vested interest  and trade unionism are transparent here). My honest reaction as a common Indian  is: Good riddance. Go. Resign, and hundreds will apply to replace the so called  'talent' (to do practice of what type is an open secret).

				<p>
					Wards with rows of empty beds, a doctor living in a mortuary and  perfectly healthy 'patients' checking in for 'treatment'. These are some of the  more startling aspects of two of the hospitals owned by the Mahatma Gandhi  Memorial Trust in Navi Mumbai.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MGM Medical College and four associated hospitals were  recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) in 1994. MCI rules require  periodic inspections to ensure that these hospitals have all the appropriate  facilities for medical students. Several of these facilities are either missing  or lying unused at these institutions. And it is only on the eve of an  inspection from the Mumbai Vidyapeeth that the authorities launch their  operation to maintain the minimum bed-occupancy level.
				</p>
				<p>
					One such inspection was scheduled on January 16. When <em>Express Newsline</em> visited the hospitals on  January 15, there was feverish activity. 'Patients' were being brought in to  fill rows of empty beds. A hospital employee was seen luring prospective  patients. "If you know of anyone who's ill, bring them along. A child's  bloated stomach, fever, cough, even a scratch on the leg will do," he  said. Twenty workers from a construction site in Nerul were picked up in this manner.  A few of these patients seemed genuinely ill, the others looked hale and  hearty. The 'patients' were paid Rs. 50 each and provided free breakfast and  meals for their service. The deals are made through a Nerul-based agent.
				</p>
				<p>
					MGM dean, S. D. Nadkarni and director S. N. Kadam denied that  such pre-inspection activities were carried out.
				</p>
				<p>
					The charade does not end at importing patients. On January 15, <em>Express Newsline</em> photographer Neeraj Priyadarshi  took pictures of a building which, a board proclaimed, was the mortuary. But  when the <em>Newsline</em> team went there again later,  the mortuary was nowhere in sight. In its place was the residence of Dr. Anil  S. Mane. R. C. Sharma, the officer on duty said a resident doctor was being  allowed to live in the premises earmarked for a mortuary. "We do not have  permission to conduct post-mortems here. So bodies are sent to Panvel for the  purpose. So we don't really need a mortuary." The exception, of course,  being the day when the university inspectors come calling. (<em>Express  Newsline</em> has  published photographs of the mortuary-turned-residence under the caption  'Death and life'.)

					Sharma admitted that at any given time, at the most, only 150 of  the 550 beds are occupied. On January 18, there were barely 11 patients in the  150-bed Gynaecological and Paediatric Hospital at Kalamboli and 56 in the 550-bed Kamothe Hospital.

					The advances of medical technology have not only helped doctors in the  diagnosis of very complicated diseases but have also provided them an avenue to  make quick bucks. The situation has disproved the theory that when competition  exists, prices come down. Huge sums are being invested in the setting up of  diagnostic centres and the only way to earn returns is by ensuring a regular  flow of referrals from doctors through the practice of paying a commission to  them.
				</p>
				<p>
					When certain tests are advised, the doctor directs the patient  to specific diagnostic centres and insists that the tests be done there. A  computerised tomographic (CT) scan can cost anything from Rs. 2000 upwards and  a bulk of this goes back to the doctor as a kick-back fee.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some members of the medical fraternity have attempted to raise  the issue and get the government to take action. Chief nephrologist of Apollo  Hospitals, Dr. M. K. Mani, informed the Medical Council of India about these  unhealthy practices more than a year ago. The Medical Council confirms that  fee-splitting is an offence. But till such time as action is taken the  virulence of the kick-back virus will continue to worsen.

					Seven insurance  medical practitioners of Employees' State Insurance Scheme (ESIS) hospitals...  were arrested on Saturday by the city police for allegedly misappropriating  government money to the tune of thousands of rupees.

					A Glasgow surgeon  became the first doctor in Britain infected with HIV to receive the all-clear  to resume surgical practice. The West Glasgow NHS Trust set up a special  working committee to consider patient safety as well as medical, ethical and  legal issues. This landmark decision by the Trust gives hope to infected health  workers. No British health worker has ever transmitted HIV to a patient. There  is much more likelihood of a worker catching the virus because of the exposure  to blood from an infected patient.
