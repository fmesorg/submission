				<h4>Aarogyasri: strengthening the private healthcare sector</h4>
				<p>
					The Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme was launched by Andhra Pradesh (AP) in   2008. It was designed to extend healthcare coverage to all people   living below the poverty line (BPL). Its need was especially felt   because the growing private healthcare sector left the poor outside the   ambit of medical care. AP had already become the state with the highest   out-of-pocket medical expenditure in the country. This tailor-made   insurance scheme required a premium of Rs 250 per family unit and   offered a total reimbursement of Rs 1.5 lakh per person or family.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, it was soon seen that instead of strengthening government   hospitals in the urban and rural networks, the scheme enabled a number   of private and corporate hospitals to be empanelled. In official   documents the scheme was touted as a unique public-private partnership,   but the distribution of cases between the two sectors was skewed.   Private health workers functioning within the system were expected to   facilitate referral of BPL patients from rural to urban hospitals, but   usually diverted cases from government to private hospitals. Reports   indicated that corporate hospitals preferred attending to only high-cost   cases that did not require lengthy post-operative care, and less   'risky' surgeries; all others were referred to government hospitals,   making the latter a "dumping ground" for critical cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the light of the widespread prevalence of such unethical   practices, the authors point out, the Aarogyasri scheme has actually fed   into the private healthcare sector, even as primary and secondary   healthcare are put on the backburner. Aarogyasri has become a populist   scheme promoting the interests of the corporate health industry, which   in turn has aggravated the medicalisation of society in complex ways.

				<h4>Training for reduced maternal mortality</h4>
				<p>
					Maternal mortality ratios in less developed countries like India and Bangladesh are high. Following the adoption of the Millennium   Development Goals-5 by several nations, many steps have been taken to   tackle this issue in these countries. Taking off from the premise that   post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) is one of the leading causes of maternal   deaths, and that in developing countries traditional birth attendants   (TBAs) attend to most of the deliveries, this study was designed to   train TBAs to better manage PPH. Conducted across six rural districts in   Bangladesh, TBAs were taught to use misoprostol, a uterotonic used to   control PPH. One advantage of misoprostol is that it can be kept at   normal room temperature, making storage much easier in settings like   rural Bangladesh. The other component is 'Quaiyum's mat' or the   absorbent delivery mat used to measure the amount of blood a woman loses   during childbirth and decide if she runs the risk of PPH. The study   employed a pre- and a post-training questionnaire to test the TBAs'   knowledge and their retention of the training. The results were found to   be satisfactory. The results also indicated that after training, many   more TBAs were using misoprostol and preventing PPH. The authors add   that the training also warned the TBAs against using the drug casually   and equipped them to evaluate the dosage and timing effectively. The   authors make a case for what the WHO describes as "task shifting"&ndash; a   process of delegation wherein tasks are shifted to less specialised   personnel depending on the situation and necessity &ndash; and integrating   TBAs into the existing healthcare system. At the same time, they note   that drugs like misoprostol have often been misused for inducing or   hastening labour. While it is important to arrest PPH in homebirths,   there are concerns about making labour-inducing drugs widely available   and part of normative practice.

				<h4>Qualitatively examining the "maternal migration effect"</h4>
				<p>
					This article looks at what it identifies as the "maternal   migration effect": when women from low socio-economic countries migrate   to countries that offer universal healthcare access, what happens to   their maternal care and maternal health. The authors discuss this in   terms of sub-Saharan African women entering the UK and coming within the   ambit of the National Health Service (NHS).
				</p>
				<p>
					The study uses the "three delay" model:  (i) delays in the   decision to seek care, because of perceived or actual barriers to   acting; (ii) delays from inadequacies in infrastructure needed to reach a   medical facility, such as ambulances and road systems; (iii) delays in   care at the facility, because of the lack of skilled birth attendants,   technological equipment and medical supplies. The women routinely faced   such barriers in the African setting. The authors looked at the barriers   when accessing the NHS.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the NHS, the barriers were at times culturally and   psychologically constructed. The authors identify three levels of trust &ndash; mistrust, distrust and feigned trust. The practice of explaining   procedures prior to taking consent was sometimes seen as reflecting the   provider's indecisiveness, and led to a decline in trust in the doctor's   abilities. Some white doctors were found to exhibit racial bias.  The   use of different languages often caused a gap in trust, even when   interpreters were available. Language problems led to a host of other   difficulties. Explaining the need for prenatal screening for foetal   abnormalities was often understood as a confirmation of an abnormality;   this in turn created stress for the woman. For women migrating mid-way   in their pregnancy, delay in stage-1 in their own setting adversely   affected their care-seeking behaviour in the subsequent stages.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors suggest that the "maternal migration effect" creates a   scenario where women make their choices based on their prior experience &ndash;limited or even non-existent -- with facility-based care. As migrants,   they are likely to adjust slowly to the new culture. This study is   important in the Indian context with growing rural-urban migration. Poor   migrant women often remain outside government health services.

				<h4>State health schemes abused</h4>

				<p>
					There have been reports of scams in Chhattisgarh and Bihar in   which health insurance provided by the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana   for BPL people is used by private practitioners to conduct unnecessary   hysterectomies.  "Beneficiaries" &ndash; several in their twenties &ndash; have   reportedly said that public facilities turned them away, but private   providers convinced them to have a hysterectomy, most of which were not   indicated. This points to a host of problems: from the apathy of the   state to unethical medical practice, to the extremely low premium placed   on the health of women, especially the poor and uneducated. The fact   that this happened under a state health insurance scheme also   underscores the fact that mere implementation of schemes will never work   without strict regulatory protocols for providers, and awareness   amongst users. The editorial also urges medical associations to take   note of these gross violations and take steps towards addressing them.

				<h4>Islamic institutional fatwas and their views on medical and research confidentiality</h4>
				<p>
					This article investigates what fatwas issued by Islamic   institutions say about the ethics of confidentiality in medical practice   and research. The authors studied fatwas issued by 14 Islamic juristic   councils at the international, regional and national levels, like Dar   al-Ifta al-Massriyyah in Egypt, Islamic Fiqh Academy in India, Fatwa   Committee of the National Council for Islamic Affairs in Malaysia and   Islamic Religious Council of Singapore, etc. They found only one fatwa   specifically on medical confidentiality, which was issued by the   International Islamic Fiqh Academy. The most comprehensive guideline   relating various aspects of Islam and medicine came in 2005 when the   document 'International ethical guidelines for biomedical research   involving human subjects &ndash; Islamic view' was published by Islamic   Organization for Medical Sciences (IOMS) and the Islamic Medical   Association of North- America (IMANA), based on the IIFA fatwa.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Fiqh council's fatwa focuses on two areas within the principle   of confidentiality: the obligation to maintain confidentiality and the   circumstances in which it is appropriate to breach it. While the first   aspect is mentioned without much detail, the second point is elaborated   on, with examples of specific situations where an infringement of   confidentiality may be made. These are based on three Islamic   principles: prohibition against backbiting; the duty to protect secrets,   and protection of information by way of demonstrating loyalty.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors conclude that there is insufficient guidance from   these councils on confidentiality. Most fatwas only mention it briefly   but they lack the specificity needed to address this complex subject.   They suggest that this may be due to the relative newness of the area of   medical ethics and research confidentiality, particularly in Islamic   countries. Moreover, the descriptions of cases permitting a breach of   confidentiality seem to be based only on the logic of "public interest   overrides individual interests". The authors argue that the issue of   medical confidentiality should be thoroughly explored from the Islamic   point of view so that it is able to guide Muslim practitioners, should   an ethical dilemma arise.

				<h4>Achieving patient safety in India</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial traces the history of discussion on inadequate   patient safety in India and suggests a five pronged strategy which can   be used to tackle this continue problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospitals in India were brought under the purview of the Consumer   Protection Act, 1986. However, many cases continue to be reported. The   writer suggests that there is a trend of 'defensive' medication by   doctors and increased litigation, with a consequent increased cost in   health care. Naming and blaming an individual makes it more difficult to   fix systemic problems, which are exacerbated by the general<em> 'laissez faire' </em>attitude   pervasive in Indian society. The editorial suggests addressing the   issue of patient safety by formulating standard operating protocols for   medical treatment and procedures. It suggests a long-term strategy,   based on learning from the West but modified for the Indian context.   This is important with the introduction, in the 12th Five   Year Plan, of universal healthcare, which will result in massive growth   of the system, and more chances of harm if measures to ensure patient   safety are not implemented. Against this background, the five-pronged   strategy discussed by the editorial is:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Advocating for and helping in creating systems for recording, learning and reporting on service quality and adverse incidents;
					</li>
					<li>
						Speeding up the implementation of proven interventions for patient safety, like the hand hygiene and surgical checklist;
					</li>
					<li>
						Empowering patients and working with groups like the Patient Safety Alliance;
					</li>
					<li>
						Capacity building and training  among youth at undergraduate   level using the WHO curriculum on patient safety though distance   education mode, and
					</li>
					<li>
						Undertaking further research on the issue.
					</li>

				<h4>The cultural and social dimensions of suicide in a Mumbai slum</h4>
				<p>
					Suicide has a peculiar position in India. The victim is the   perpetrator and if s/he survives, s/he faces both social stigma and   criminal prosecution. This study employed a cultural epidemiology   framework to understand the social determinants of suicide in an urban   slum in Mumbai. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods,   researchers interviewed the closest relative and a distantly related   person of the deceased. A total of 50 pairs of interviews found that   tension, sadness, various behavioral problems, marital conflict and   financial problems were the most frequently reported causes of suicide.   However, as the article reports, relatives often did not agree on the   'cause' of suicide. When mental illness was a possible factor,   differences of opinion were greater. The explanations were also   influenced by relationship of respondents to the victim. Further the   responses were also shaped by what is considered socially acceptable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study highlighted the consistencies and discrepancies within   explanations of suicide within a community. The authors emphasize the   need to look at the complexity of social and cultural determinants to   complement a purely psychological approach to understanding suicide.   Despite the limitations of the study, more such studies are needed.   Suicide should be treated as a problem that requires both   demystification and ethical and sensitive interventions.
