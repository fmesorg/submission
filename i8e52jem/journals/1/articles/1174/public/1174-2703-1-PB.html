					The  relationship between the press and doctors is difficult to define.  Whereas doctors are not allowed, according to their code of ethics, to  advertise or talk to the press, one routinely finds gross violation of  these rules. One newspaper in this city carries, at least twice a week, a  health- or disease- related story, usually written in 'human interest'  style. I find this a significant difference between this newspaper and  its parent newspaper in Bombay (unless things have changed recently).  Indeed, more and more newspapers have started aping this, clearly an  indication of what people like to read.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus we  have articles with titles like 'first.&mdash; done in city' or '&mdash; will save  lives'. Photographs of the patient are, of course, included so that it  adds to the authenticity &mdash; while patient privacy takes a backseat.  Physicians, otherwise rather busy professionals, somehow manage to find  time to talk to the press. That many of the statements are unscientific and  even ridiculous at times seems to be irrelevant.

					This  and other related topics were the subject of a dissertation by a  colleague of mine at The Institute of Law and Ethics in Medicine course  at the National Law School of India University. Her findings and discussion  were interesting, but I cannot divulge them as I hope to see a paper from  her in the pages of this journal in the near future.

					However,  what is clear is this: doctors can now safely write for the lay press,  according to a judgement passed by the Karnataka high court recently. The  Karnataka Medical Council saw red in 1997 when they noticed an article in  the lay press by a noted vascular surgeon in Bangalore. They immediately  hauled him up, stating that the article in the newspaper amounted to an  advertisement. The surgeon then approached the High Court where Mr Justice  RV Raveendran decided that the article was clearly meant to educate the  public and could not be misconstrued as an advertisement. No payment was made  for an advertisement; nor was there any solicitation of patients, noted  the judge. The matter written on would fall into the purview of 'matters  of public health', he added. As someone who has written in the newspaper  on matters of health in the past, I am relieved.

					Some  months ago I had written, "Nothing ever happens in Bangalore." Well,  it appears I was wrong. Chittaranjan Andrade and BS Srihari of the  NIMHANS have been awarded the 2001 IgNobel award for their research that  school children in Bangalore pick their noses. For those unaware of the  awards, they are awarded by the journal Annals of Improbable Research (<a href="http://www.improbable.com/" target="_blank">www.improbable.com</a>) for research that 'cannot and  should not' be repeated. 'A Preliminary Survey of Rhinotillexomania in an  Adolescent Sample.' (J Clin Psychiatr 2001; 62: 426-431) was the  paper &mdash; and rhinotillexomania refers to digging one's nose! Two hundred  school-going children were interviewed to learn the exciting fact that it  is a common habit.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I  accept that research findings can be useful on unexpected occasions and  while I am certainly not the best of referees in psychiatry, surely there  is something wrong with such research. This is similar to a news report in  October last year that the ICMR had given a grant to a group of  scientists to measure the average length of the Indian penis. I look  forward to comments from readers, especially those who disagree with me.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is  not to say that NIMHANS does only such research. A report in <em>The Times of  India</em> states that not only is Bangalore the country's IT capital and garden  city, it is also its suicide capital. From 426 suicides in 1990, the number  increased to 1,938 in 1999, clearly a serious matter. It appears  alcoholism is an important fcator. The WHO, taking notice of the  increase, has initiated workshops to educate and sensitise the public  about this epidemic and ultimately devise strategies for suicide  prevention.

					Many  medical professionals have felt offended at being equated with businessmen and  shopkeepers while their patients are likened to consumers, according to the  Consumer Protection Act. Where will this lead us? You might get an idea from a  patient of ours who recently demanded her money back because she believed that  the investigations ordered ('ordered', to use the American term; I personally  prefer the term 'requested', which is more polite if less used, but with  essentially the same meaning) by her physician were not indicated clinically.  What next? Money-back guarantee if the surgical biopsy is inadequate for  opinion? 100% success to be promised after surgery? We need to get rid of this  department-store mentality. I have already seen: "Do one test  (investigation) and get the other done free." Rather like a pizza  joint.

					A physics  post-gradauate (my teacher's son) writes to me about my Letter on the ethics of  publishing, that this phenomenon occurs in his field too. The "publish or  perish" aspect has resulted in many useless papers being published. With  reference to my statement about not wanting to be a co-author because I  disagreed with the conclusions, he states that most of the papers that he  collected during his literature search had no proper conclusion! Truly, in  medicine, we are rather more lucky, it would seem.
