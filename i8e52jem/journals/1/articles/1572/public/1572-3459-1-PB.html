					Special issue of <em>Humanscape</em> 1997; 4: 1-42
				</p>
				<p>
					Focussing on a broad range of  topics, this journal has striven to uphold standards and highlighted fearlessly  our existing deficiencies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The special issue on medical ethics is edited by Dr. Amar  Jesani. The essays on this subject occupy 33 of the 42 pages and include  analysis of euthanasia (Kannamma S. Raman), organ transplantation (Sanjay  Nagral) and the facilities provided for health care in the public sector  (Rashmi Lakshminarayana). The latter essay brings out forcefully the declining  interest shown by the central government and those in most of our states in  providing for the health and treatment of our poorest citizens. The table showing  the availability of dispensaries and health centres in our states is especially  revealing. Kerala is the only state where 90% of villages have a dispensary  within two kilometres and 47% have a health centre in the same range. Contrast  the figures for a state such as Maharashtra, where our rulers claim that they  are enlightened. Dispensaries are avaiiable within two kilometrcs to just 22.3%  of viliages and health centres in the same distance to just 7% of villages! It  is a matter of considerable surprise that corresponding figures for Bihar are  25% and 31%. The data analysed in this essay demands careful study and  corrective action.

					Rama Baru discusses 'philanthropy for profit' - an apt title for  an essay dealing with our private and 'charitable' hospitals. Whilst no one  grudges the need for private hospitals to make a profit, when this is done  after availing themselves of tax concessions on the basis of professed concern  for the poor and through the misuse of the same high technology equipment thus  imported, the failure of our regulatory agencies becomes especially worrying.  Take this essay together with that by Sunil Kaul (' If one were to attempt a  classification of quacks, it may be well to start with senior professors...')  and you are made well aware of the lack both of rationality and ethics in  medical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is the solution proposed by Thomas George (eliminate the profit  motive and stop private practice) feasible?
				</p>
				<p>
					The closing section provides two accounts by the relatives of  patients of their experiences with doctors. In both instances mcdica!  negligence has been alleged, Navin Shah, settled in USA, discusses the role of  litigation. It is a pity that the last page, entitled Human Index, has not been  exclusively devoted to facts from Indian medicine. These would have proved  especially effective in underlining the contents of many of the preceding  essays.

				<h4>The gravest show on earth: America in the age of AIDS. Burkett Elinor, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 1995. 399 pages.</h4>

				<p>
					(This book is available at the library of the American Center, Mumbai.  362.1969792/BUR)
				</p>
				<h5>Introduction</h5>
				<p>
					This is an  extraordinary account of the evolution of our understanding of the disease produced  by the virus that destroys immunity in humans. It contains the fruits of seven  years of research on the subject. For anyone interested in learning the truth  on this disease, this is a book that must be read.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will get some idea  of the quality of what is on offer from the first and second paragraphs under  'Acknowledgements':
				</p>
				<p>
					No individual ever  authors a book alone. Books, like ideas in them, reflect a complex series o f  interaclions, relationships and experiences that form a unique consciousness.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three of the  individuals whose influence is stamped most heavily on this work are dead.  Enrique, Juan and Miguel shared their deaths with me. In doing so they offered  me the profound gift of a series of lessons in fear, pain and morality, as well  as the courage and grace about which so much is written. Mostly they taught me  about honesty - for when your life is narrowing to fewer and fewer weeks, and  to increasingly confined spaces, truth emerges from the ruins of banality with  extraordinary clarity. If I no longer mince words. it is because I have  learned, in the most profound way, that there simply isn't any lime.
				</p>
				<h5>Truth - sacrificed to other interests</h5>
				<p>
					Burkett shows how easily truth becomes a casualty of competing interests;  commercial, political and scientitic. She provides details on several  individuals. The story of Larry Kramer-- novelist and playwright, fund-raiser  for those suffering from AIDS and self-appointed consciencekeeper with a  genius for converting friends into opponents - is fascinating.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her narrative of the  'discovery' of the AIDS virus by Robert Gallo championed by American media and  politicians - and demonstration of how credit was snatched away from the true  hero, Luc Montagnier of France, by Gallo; is just one of the fascinating  glimpses offered by her of what went on behind the-scenes. She also describes  how Jonas Salk (of the vaccine fame) provided incomplete information on his own  researches on HIV in such a manner that his company's stock prices kept moving  upwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					She tells of how Henry  Heimlich (famed for his maneuver to free the airway of an ingested obstructing  agent) touted the malarial plasmodium as a cure. She weaves the different  threads of her narrative deeply and effectively.
				</p>
				<h5>Transmission of HIV virus from dentist to patient</h5>
				<p>
					The story of Kimberly  Bergalis (in Chapter Eight entitled The immaculate transmission) is especially  stomach turning. This girl, who was a virgin, had never used drugs or received  a blood transfusion, when she developed AIDS. The infection was eventually  traced to the removal of two of her teeth by Dr. David Acer, a homosexual  dentist, two years earlier. Acer tested positive for HIV and developed AIDS.  Even after this information became public knowledge, reporters continued to ask  whether her hymen was intact and whether there was proof that she had never had  anal penetratton. Others called her a slut and worse. On her death from AIDS,  her parents were sent obnoxious letters, one of them stating: 'Thank God the  bitch is dead. She got what was coming to her.'
				</p>
				               
				<h5>Capitalising on AIDS</h5>
				<p>
					The chapters dealing  with the 'AIDS gravy train' shock the reader in the manner that the author  fully intended. That individuals - including scientists - and corporations  should do everything in their power to profit from the AIDS industry leaves us  numb. Consider just some of the spheres which have spawned venality:  researchers flying from one conference to another - almost always in five-star  hotels in exotic locations, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical trades,  manufacturers of condoms and other such accessories, AIDS and bereavement  counselors, AIDS spokespersons and activists heading large Issues in MEDICAL  ETHICS Vol. 5 No. 3 Jul-Sep 1997 organisations. The book is amply documented.  The section listing and describing her sources covers twenty-two pages.</p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>If you look for sentimentality in this book, you will be  disappointed. If, however, you are searching for the facts behind the masks,  camouflages and cover-ups, you've opened the correct volume.

					A few years ago on a visit to the Western Coalfields Hospital at  Chandrapur I was asked to demonstrate upper gastrointestinal endoscopies on  patients at the hospital, all of whom were coal miners. I was surprised to find  a large number of these patients suffering from severe gastritis and peptic  ulcers and naturally wondered whether their exposure to coal dust could in  anyway be responsible for this. I inquired with the local doctors who confirmed  the high incidence of these diseases but were themselves not sure whether this  could be related to their occupation. I realized how poorly equipped and  trained we were as medical professional to identify possible occupational  sources of disease and I am sure all of us from whichever field of medicine  encounter such situations in our practice. In a sense this is a failure on our  part to sensitize ourselves to a very important aspect of our patients'  problems which has major social, legal and financial implications
				</p>
				<p>
					It is against this background that the above books written by  doctors and health activists who are not full time occupational health  practitioners, but are working voluntarily in the field, form an important  contribution to an area in which there is very little written in proportion to  the problem in India.
