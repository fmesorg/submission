					Patient  autonomy is an accepted principle in medical ethics, In actual practice, this  important principle is usually either ignored or only partially accepted, particularly  in the Indian context. Informed consent is probably the most important concept  flowing from the doctrine of autonomy. In the Indian context, informed consent  was practically nonexistent till the Consumer Protection Act was made  applicable to the medical profession. Now, both doctors and patients are  becoming more aware about this concept, and patients are better informed of  their rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					This  increasing patient awareness seems to have created confusion and panic in the  medical profession, and has also made the medical profession defensive.  Informed consent is seen more as a legal requirement than an ethical  obligation. A review of the various legal issues and the case law may remove  the confusion.
				</p>
				<p>
					An adult patient has complete autonomy over his body when he can consent to any  form of' medical treatment without fear of being vetoed by someone else. Any  procedure done without consent would amount to battery and assault. However,  complete patient autonomy gets restricted in certain circumstances. For  example, despite accepting the notion of complete patient autonomy, courts all  over the world are reluctant to legally accept active euthanasia.
				</p>
				<p>
					Valid consent is necessary before any medical treatment. Such consent can be  implied, as in the case of a general physician's treatment involving physical  examination and administering injections. The consent practiced in Indian  hospitals particularly in public hospitals &mdash; in which patients being admitted  are asked to sign a form stating that they are willing for any form of  treatment, is a blanket consent of questionable legal validity. To give  informed consent to treatment of any nature, the patient must have the required  information.
				</p>

				<h4>True and informed  consent</h4>
				<p>
					Courts  in India and other Commonwealth countries have long differentiated between true  and informed consent. The concept of true consent was enunciated by British  courts in Sidway v Board of Governers of the Royal Bethleham Hospital ( 1985) 2  WLR 840. A patient operated upon for back pain suffered paralysis due to spinal  cord injury and sued the hospital and surgeon for not informing her of the risk  before surgery. The court held that the risk was agreed to be less than one per  cent and since there was a responsible body of medical opinion who would have informed  the patient in similar terms as those used by the surgeon, the latter was not  negligent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Blythe v Bloomsbury Health Authority (1993) 4 Med L. Rev. 15 1, the patient  complained that the doctor had not disclosed all the risks of Depo Provera. The  court held that the doctor is not obliged to explain all possible risks of a  treatment in responding to a general inquiry from the patient. As in Sidway,  the courts held that the general test of medical negligence &mdash; as explained in  Hunter v Hanley by Lord President Clyde and later in Bolam v Friern Hospital by  Macnair J (1957) &mdash; would apply to the legal question about consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Indian courts have followed the same principle over the years. This is  evident from L. B. Joshi v T. R. Godbole SC AIR pg 183- 187 and Ram Bhiharital  v Dr. Srivatsava AIR I985 MP pg I57- 158. However. American and Canadian courts  have taken a more liberal 'patient oriented' view compared to the 'doctor  oriented' approach of British and Indian courts. In Canterbury v Spence (1972)  464 F( sd) 772 the court gave more importance to the 'reasonable' patient than  to the 'reasonable' doctor. In this case the patient had suffered temporary  paralysis following surgery for back pain. The court held that all possible  risks should be explained to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact in Hatcher v Black, Lord Denning cautioned British courts against the  dangers of following the American concept of informed consent. In this case a  singer was operated for a thyroid nodule and suffered a temporary change in  voice. She sued the doctor for non-disclosure of all the facts. In Arato v  Aveon (1994) 6 Med L Rev 230, the Supreme Court of California held that the  concept of informed consent required disclosure of all material facts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, courts in some commonwealth countries have started accepting the  American concept of informed consent. In Roger v Whitaker (1992), an Australian  court held the doctor guilty for not disclosing the risk of symphathetic  opthalmitis in the normal eye after surgery on a diseased eye.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can a doctor conduct a procedure or operate in the absence of consent in the  best interests of the patient? Again on this point there is diversity of  opinion between American and Canadian courts on the one hand and British and  Indian courts on the other. In the Canadian case of Malette v Shulman (I991) 2  Med L. Rev 162., a road accident victim required a blood transfusion. The  doctors were informed that her belongings contained a Jehovah 's Witness card  requesting that no blood products be used in her treatment. However, in view of  the patient's deteriorating condition, the doctor went ahead with the blood  transfusion. Thc Ontario Court of Appeal held that the doctor was guilty of  trespass. In Thor v Supreme Court ( 1994) Med L Rev 220 the Supreme Court of  California held that a prisoner who was quadriplegic but mentally competent  cannot be kept by force on a life support system.

				<h4>Lack of consent not  always a constraint</h4>
				<p>
					On the  other hand, in India, Dr Thomas v Smt. Elisa, AIR 1987, the court held that the  doctor was guilty of' negligence for not operating on a patient with life-  threatening peritonitis following a perforated appendix only because the  patient was not in a condition to give consent and the relatives were not  available. The court held that it is the doctor's ethical and legal duty to  treat the patient to best of his ability; lack of valid consent is not a  constraint in life-threatening situations. This view was reiterated by the  Indian Supreme Court in Paramanand Katara v Union of India.
				</p>
				<p>
					British courts have adopted a flexible approach to the question of patient's  unfettered autonomy. For example in Re F( 1989) 2 WLR 1025, a 36- year- old  female patient in an institute for the mentally handicapped formed a sexual  relationship with a male inmate. The court allowed the institute to do a  tubectomy with the view that the patient was incapable of managing other forms  of contraception or of handling the consequences of pregnancy and childbirth.  In many cases the courts have allowed the hospital and doctors to stop  life-support systems in patients of Permanent Vegetative Status (PVS).
				</p>
				<p>
					It is obvious from the cases quoted here that the case law on informed consent  remains inconclusive, with a wide diversity of opinion amongst various courts.  This is more so in the Indian context, as we have various disciplines of  medicine. Many disciplines like Ayurveda have very few standardised therapeutic  systems. Therefore, informed consent even with good intentions becomes a  practically difficult proposition.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result of the confusion and panic on informed consent, doctors are  scurrying to prepare various 'legally foolproof' consent forms. A signed  consent form of any nature neither guarantees a doctor protection against legal  action nor ensures patient satisfaction. It merely demonstrates that some  process to exchange information was followed. Wrangling about consent forms  does little to advance the debate about the ethical aspect of informed consent.  The medical professional's paranoia about medico- legal cases has given birth  to ethically questionable notions such as the Informed Request, a patient has  to request the doctor for the treatment or surgery &mdash; and this is supposed to  remove the necessity of informed consent!
					<br />
					Fully informed consent is probably never attainable. A sick person by the very  nature of his or her illness has lost some measure of autonomy. The immense  complexities of modern medical technology and drugs and their many possible  side effects can never be explained to the nonmedical person: many are not even  known to the medical profession. Intraoperative and postoperative pain is  difficult to predict, as there are various determinants like the patient's pain  threshold, state of' his illness, age, cultural background and psychological  status. There are no precise words to communicate the extent and quantum of  pain. Pain remains beyond communication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Communication forms the soul of the concept on informed consent. However,  communication is something which is not taught to medical students. A study in  Australia found that 66 per cent of complaints of medical negligence arise  following poor or improper communication. The majority of complaints received  by consumer associations in India are following such a communication breakdown  between doctor and patient. Modern medical science and prognosis of various  diseases are based on probabilities. A patient of' diabetic foot gangrene can  be told that he has a 20 per cent chance of limb salvage following  re-vascularisation. What the patient really wants to know is whether he is  likely to be in that lucky 20 per cent. Modern science cannot guarantee this  and this usually forms the nucleus for a breakdown in communication. The  patient's expectation is natural. Therefore, improving medical graduates'  communication skills should form the basis of better informed consent. A  'biohumane' rather than a 'biopositivist' medical profession is the need of the  hour. Communication is an art as well as a science.
				</p>

				<h4>The concept can be  abused</h4>
				<p>
					It is  also necessary for patients and consumer groups to realise that every illness  or disease has a 'price'. No treatment is without side effects. The  benefit-risk ratio of every treatment is important. A patient with a fractured  neck femur, in spite of excellent treatment with ultra modern implants, is  likely to have some restriction of hip joint movements. This cannot and should  not form the basis for non-disclosure of risk and lack of informed consent.  Abuse of the concept of informed consent is detrimental to the long- term  interest of the country's health care system. Therefore patient education  should form part of strategies followed by consumer groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					The debate about informed consent needs to move away from the legal aspect to  the domain of ethics where it really belongs. Unless ethical standards in the  profession are enforced, medico-legal aspects of informed consent will continue  to haunt doctors.
