					The October 1996 issue, on this page, carried  a one page appeal-cum-explanation of our dilemmas arising out of the  financial constraints under which we produce this journal. It was titled <em>'A Search for Revenue'.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					We publish this financial statement for two  reasons:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						because we believe that every reader is  part of our endeavour to usher in the rightful place for ethics in our society;
					</li>
					<li>
						we believe that transparency is crucial in  such an endeavour.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					<em>Issues in Medical  Ethics </em>(IME) is brought out  by collective and voluntary efforts in all aspects of work involved. The Forum  for Medical Ethics Society (FMES), a registered non-profit voluntary  organisation, does not even have an office of its own, and no other  infrastructure whatsoever. We have been acutely aware that without basic  infrastructure, our volunteers may soon bum out, creating a crisis for this  venture. For the first three or four years, there was a real problem in  generating revenues to meet deficits. In order to find a solution to these  problems we had several rounds of discussion, and last year we grudgingly  decided to accept advertisements for generating additional resources so that we  could do justice by the commercial agencies performing backbreaking tasks  without payment to compensate them as we should.
				</p>

				<h4>Meeting ends</h4>
				<p>
					You must have observed  in the issues published in 1997 that we have not been successful in generating  any additional revenues through advertisements. Perhaps the standards set for  accepting advertisement by us have been found to be too high by companies  interested in inserting advertisements. Our need for generating revenues for  the journal through advertisements remains. We need help from those of you who  have experience in this field
				</p>
				<p>
					The year 1997 was not a disappointment. Our appeal  for increase in number of subscribers and donations was taken seriously by many  of you. Some of you made an extra effort to enrol more subscribers by directly  approaching friends, or by going around in the conferences and meetings  collecting subscriptions for the journal. We are specially grateful to Dr.  Pramod Dukle of Panjim for his Herculean efforts on our behalf. Some of you  directed us to potential donors whom we approached with some success. As a  consequence, you will be happy to learn that this year we have succeeded  in balancing our income and expenditure.
				</p>

				<h4>Statement of income  and expenditure April 1,1996 to March 31,1997</h4>
				<p>
					Income from  subscriptions Rs. 44,188
				</p>
				<p>
					The number of paid subscribers of the journal  for the year 1997 (Volume 5) jumped from 300 to 600. Although the relative  increase in the number of subscribers is impressive, in absolute numbers the  level of circulation of the journal is a far cry from what we should be  achieving with over 1,000,000 registered doctors of all systems of medicine in  practice in India.

					<strong>Donations</strong> We thank the following for making donations to  the IME / FMES:

					We print about 1,000 copies of each issue.  This number will be increased from October 1997. Obviously, the cost of the  printing the journal is low, and that is not because prices are low. The credit  for this remarkable feat goes to two agencies: .
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						Messrs.       Parkar Arts, who have been doing the layout and page-making of the       journal and much more, free of cost.
					</li>
					<li>
						Messrs.       Chintanakshar Graphics, who have not only been printing the journal at       cost price, but have been delivering copies on time. They also helped us       by printing 5,000 copies of the brochure of this journal free of cost.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Our thanks to both these organisations and all  individuals who have stood by this journal.

				<p>
					For the first time, our account book shows a  modest surplus. If we can generate more funds, we would like to start  compensating Messrs. Parkar Arts and Messrs. Chintanakshar Graphics, at least  in part, for their extraordinary services to us.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Life Subscriptions :</strong> Rs.71,920
				</p>
				<p>
					We now have sixty-six life subscribers. These  funds are included under Liabilities in the balance sheet and have been  invested in fixed deposits. We can only use the interest earned.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Donation to corpus  from eight persons :</strong> Rs. 8,253
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><strong>Towards stability</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					As is evident, due to  the voluntary support received and increase in subscriptions, we have overcome  the critical period faced last year. The move from survival to stability needs  even greater effort than that expended during the past five years.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>We need to aim at the  following:</h4>
				<p>
					Subscriptions 5,000
				</p>
				<p>
					This number will ensure viability of the  journal.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Increase       in the amount in our corpus to Rs. 10,00,000. This will help us obtain       professional help to further improve the quality and contents of the       journal
					</li>
					<li>
						Infrastructure:       The Forum for Medical Ethics and its journal need a furnished and equipped       (telephone, fax, computers) office of its own in Mumbai. (At present we       operate from a member's residence.)
					</li>
					<li>
						There       is a need to build the Forum for Medical Ethics Society as a democratic       association of doctors and all others interested in improving medical and       health care ethics in India.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					None of the above is possible without  collective effort.
				</p>
				<p>
					We welcome contributions towards each of the  above needs. Most of all, we request volunteer effort to sustain our endeavour.
