				<p>
					Six years since the passing of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, recognising brain death, only 28 cadaver kidneys have been transplanted in Mumbai. Why is our cadaver organ transplant programme in such a sorry state?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The definition of death</h4>
				<p>
					Most doctors are uncomfortable with the idea of declaring brain death and hesitate to explain it to deceased patients' families, preferring to wait till cardiac arrest occurs. This is
					a disservice to those needing organ transplants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the definition of brain death is specified only in the context of the transplant law. Doctors often interpret
					this to mean that brain death should be declared only if the deceased's organs will be donated. If not, the person is
					continued on 'life support' till cardiac asystole. This creates
					confusion and stress. For example, a family was told that
					their loved one was no more, and then asked if they would
					like to donate her organs. When they decided not to donate,
					they were told the body could not be taken immediately;
					they were legally required to wait for cardiac arrest to occur.
					This made them wonder whether the brain death diagnosis
					was correct, and reinforced their decision against donation.
				</p>

				<h4>System flaws</h4>
				<p>
					Cadaver transplants have not been promoted by the medical
					profession. Doctors not directly connected with
					transplantation programmes have often advised against
					organ donation, even when families inquire about the
					procedure. This broadcasts their lack of faith in the medical
					system. Some nephrologists agree to transplant from
					unrelated living donors instead of suggesting that the
					patient register for a cadaver kidney. Finally, hospital
					authorities ignore instructions to report brain death cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Efforts to promote cadaver organ transplants have also
					back-fired because of doctors' thoughtlessness. It is
					important to give the family time to come to terms with
					their loved one' death before suggesting organ donation,
					but doctors are known to tell the family about the death
					and ask them to consider organ donation in the same breath.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some donor families have wrongly been billed for the
					donation process. Such lapses harm the programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					The time involved in the organ donation process can be a
					deterrent, especially in medico-legal cases. A patient was
					admitted for cerebral trauma following an accident, and
					declared brain dead. Before the organs could be retrieved
					the body had to be taken to the police station and then for
					post mortem. Couldn't post mortems be avoided when the
					cause of death is not controversial? Could postmortems for
					patients of donor families be done on a priority basis?
				</p>
				<p>
					Some families ask for monetary compensation or waiving
					of hospital charges as a condition to donation. Such incentives could help increase donations. In Spain (with
					the highest rate of organ donors), the government meets
					donors' funeral expenses.
				</p>

				<h4>Public awareness</h4>
				<p>
					Public awareness of brain death and organ donation is low,
					and most families are exposed to the idea for the first time
					when a loved one is declared brain dead &mdash; a difficult time
					to discuss consent to donation. The problem is compounded
					by public suspicion of kidney transplant rackets.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, the extended family is involved in important
					decisions, and may overrule the immediate family's
					agreement to donation. Some common misconceptions to
					be tackled are: organ donation is against one's religion, it
					will cause the family further pain, or the system of organ
					allocation is biased.
				</p>
				<p>
					Donors' relatives have been grateful for the opportunity
					to donate their loved one's organs. Those not given the
					opportunity have regretted that their loss was not mitigated
					by something good out of the tragedy. Everyone in this
					position should receive comprehensible information to
					make an informed decision on the matter.
				</p>

				<h4>Recipients' reservations</h4>
				<p>
					Most patients needing transplantation are unaware of the
					option. Renal failure patients are rarely aware of the
					possibility of a cadaver-kidney transplant; they are usually
					looking for a living donor. Other organ failure patients are
					dying because no treatment options exist. For those who
					do register for a transplant, the uncertainties of waiting for
					an organ can be emotionally sapping. Then, some cannot
					afford the cost of surgery and post-transplant drugs to be
					taken lifelong. Patients registered for a cadaver kidney have
					been forced to decline when a kidney became available
					because they could not raise the money. Planning is
					necessary; charitable trusts offer financial help for medical
					treatment, the government can reduce drug costs, and early
					enrollment to health insurance schemes can make this
					treatment accessible to a greater percentage of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Mumbai there have been no cadaver transplants of
					organs other than kidneys. So patients needing other organs
					fear being 'guinea pigs' and hesitate to register for a
					transplant. They shop around for advice and resort to
					alternative therapies, in the bargain losing money and
					sometimes their lives. On the rare occasion when a donor
					organ is available, potential recipients are not on record. In
					one case a liver retrieved in Mumbai was used for a patient
					in Delhi.
				</p>
				<p>
					We need a body to monitor organ demand and supply,
					with a transparent protocol for putting patients on the
					waiting list and distributing organs. This will require
					support from doctors who identify donors and those who
					transplant organs, from families who donate organs and
					from patients waiting for organs. It will work only if people
					know that it is impartial and in society's interest.
