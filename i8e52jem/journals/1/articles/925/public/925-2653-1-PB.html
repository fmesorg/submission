				<h4>Starvation of children in Syria &ndash; sanctions and the politics of revenge</h4>
				<p>
					As Syria completes two years of western sanctions (2011&ndash;13),
					their dramatic effects on health are being highlighted with first
					reports of starvation deaths among children in the suburbs of
					Damascus <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cihan. Starvation kills children in Damascus.World Bulletin.net. 2013 Sep 30 [cited 2013 Dec 11]. Available from: http://www.worldbulletin.net/?a Type=haber&ArticleID=119406" id="1">(1)</a>. Although heavy fighting has taken place in this
					area, experts had predicted for some time the unworkability of
					sanctions for regime change <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pape RA. Why economic sanctions do not work. International Security [Internet]. 1997 autumn; 22(2): 90–136.

					would pay the price in a country (Syria in this case) which was
					once well on the way to meeting the Millennium Development
					Goals 4 targets on reducing child mortality <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sen K, Al-Faisal W, AlSaleh Y.

					the case of other "sanctioned" countries, it is not just "civilians"
					but the most vulnerable among them &ndash; children, who are
					experiencing the tragic consequences of sanctions.

				<p>
					Several infants have died of hunger in the suburbs of Damascus
					and also in Yarmouk and other pockets of the country at the
					epicentre of conflict.

					Several children had died by mid-October (2013) and one
					doctor was quoted as saying to <em>Der Spiegel</em> <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reuter C.

					infants are so weak that a mild infection will kill them. While
					the west remains obsessed with its own security and the need
					for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons so that they do not
					fall into the hands of the <em>jihadists,</em> International humanitarian
					law would be better served if they (the Western governments,
					notably the USA, UK and France) made some real effort to
					protect civilians by putting pressure on the Syrian government
					and on western-funded militias, not to continue to use civilians
				as a shield or a tool for vengeance. </p>
