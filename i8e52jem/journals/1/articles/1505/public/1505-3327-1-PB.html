					This sophisticated speciality promotes expensive therapies of dubious value

					The  Sunday newspaper has a full page feature on 'Dil ka doctor and his  state-of-the-heart plans' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="'Dil ka doctor and his state-of-the-heart plans.' The Sunday Times of India. April 4, 1999, p. 16." id="1">(1)</a>. The box, "Our panel of doctors", informs readers  of the top 10 cardiologists in five metropolitan cities. The 'special report'  on the 'techniques which will tame our pagal dil" presents the cafeteria of  coronary care, from trivial measures to transplants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such articles do little to educate but plenty to scare readers into believing  that we are on "the brink of an epidemic" of cardiac disease. This one also  makes grandiose promises, foreseeing routine robotic surgery, and gene therapy  with a "magic gene that could make the heart automatically grow fresh arteries  to take over from the tired, thickened ones." This combination of journalese  and medical language seems unaware of the manifest scientific implausibility of  current coronary concepts. The fact is that despite all the developments over  decades of research and treatment, the death rate attributable to coronary  heart disease remains unchanged. And this is the unethical nature of current  coronary care.

				<h4>Coronary  artery disease</h4>
				<p>
					Cardiology  covers a wide variety of cardiovascular problems. Much of cardiology practice  is concentrated on that branch of cardiology which deals with coronary artery  disease (CAD). The essential problem in CAD is that the heart does not get its  requisite quantum of blood because its lifeline -- the coronary arterial field  -- is clogged. The solution: the artery must be made to carry more blood, by  medical or surgical means; the blood must be monitored and kept thin and free  from the overload of cholesterol and other undesirable lipid elements through  drugs and diet; and finally, the heart should be helped to work less, to  minimise the chances of a crisis in coronary blood supply.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the causes of CAD are not known. Which means no one knows what the  cure is. The drugs and procedures that cardiologists employ address the  symptoms, not the pathology of the disease. Likewise, the course of CAD is  essentially a matter of guesswork, and no investigation, however sophisticated,  can predict exactly what is going to happen. A recent report comments: "A hot  topic among clinicians today, the concept of evidence-based medicine, evolved  from the growing realisation that many of the tests and treatments introduced  in clinical practice are of unproven or uncertain benefit."

				<h4>Treatments,  medical and surgical</h4>
				<p>
					Medical  measures aimed at affecting the coronary arterial tree work by blocking enzymes  or channels. The drugs may relieve local symptoms, but they also interfere with  the physiological mechanism in the entire body.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other means to widen the coronary arteries is to attack them directly. But  it is not known if a blocked coronary artery is an effect or a cause <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roberts WC and Maximilian Buja L: The prevalence and significance of thrombi in coronary arteries in fatal acute myocardial infarction. Annals of Internal Medicine. 1970; 72: 781-782." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hurst JW: Obstruction of coronary arteries. Journal of the American Medical Association. 1983; 250: 1763-1765." id="4">4)</a>.  Treating the result may be of no benefit. Angioplasty is known to cause  'angioplasty-induced defiant stenosis'. It has been opined that angioplasty  forcibly tears the artery to create the illusion of a wider artery and a  greater flow <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vermani R: Pathologic indicators of re-stenosis. Dr ND Patel Oration, GSM College, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, December 29, 1992." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even the bible of doctors, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, has been  unable over the years to explain how bypass surgery works. The learned text  offers three possible explanations. The placebo effect (a theory that justifies  calling the bypass the costliest aspirin), sensory neurectomy (the heart stays  the same but the patient no longer feels any pain) or -hold your breath -by  killing the complaining segment of the heart. To quote from the latest edition:  "Angina is abolished or greatly reduced in approximately 90 per cent of  patients following coronary re-vascularisation. Although this is usually  associated with graft patency and restoration of blood flow, the pain may also  have been alleviated as a result of infarction of the ischaemic segment or  placebo effect... Coronary artery bypass graft does not appear to reduce the  incidence of myocardial infarction in patients with chronic ischaemic heart  disease. Perioperative (i. i.e.. in the immediate post-operative period)  infarction occurs in five to 10 per cent of cases but in most instances these  infarcts are small... there is no evidence that coronary artery bypass surgery  improves survival of patients with one or two vessel disease with chronic  stable angina." <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine (Vols. 1,2) McGraw-Hill, NY, Editions 10 to 14, 1983 to 1998. latest edition: pg. 2748." id="6">(6)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Routine aspirin therapy to prevent blood from coagulating and clotting is now  an established procedure for patients with arterial problems. However, aspirin  spawns a "high incidence of gastro-intestinal irritation" <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="British National Formulary, published by British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, Number 35, 1998, pg.195." id="7">(7)</a> with occult blood  loss occurring "in most people taking aspirin long-term, sometimes sufficient  to cause iron-deficiency anemia" <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Laurence DR et al: Clinical pharmacology, Eighth edition. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1997, pg. 256." id="8">(8)</a>. Some cardiologists may retort that blood  loss and anaemia actually reduce CAD <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Root-Bernstein R and Root-Bernstein M: Honey, mud, maggots and other medical marvels. Houghton Mifflin Boston, 1998, pg. 80." id="9">(9)</a>. However, such an approach amounts to  doing probable good but perpetrating actual harm.

				<h4>Aspirin:  More damage than good</h4>
				<p>
					Aspirin  works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Laurence DR et al: Clinical pharmacology, Eighth edition. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1997, pg. 256." id="8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mayes PA: Metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids. In Harper's Biochemistry (Ed: Murray RK et al). Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, 1994, pg. 232." id="10">10)</a>. Yet prostaglandins are  believed to be potent coronary vasodilators, anti-platelet aggregators,  fibrinolytic and pro-heparin, all actions that are good for the heart <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rang HP et al: Pharmacology third edition, Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1998, pg. 277." id="11">(11</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singer M and Webb A: Oxford handbook of critical care, OUP, 1998, p. 12." id="12">12)</a>.  Because of their staunch faith in aspirin, cardiologists suppose that the  particular prostaglandins that aspirin inhibits are not that important <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mayes PA: Metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids and eicosanoids. In Harper's Biochemistry (Ed: Murray RK et al). Appleton and Lange, Norwalk, 1994, pg. 232." id="10">(10)</a>.  However, aspirin may do more damage than good.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cholesterol-lowering drugs may be yet another fraud foisted on unsuspecting  patients. When data from the earliest trial on clofibrate, the pioneer  cholesterol lowering drug, were decoded, mortality in the clofibrate-treated  group was found to be 25 per cent higher than in the placebo-controlled group <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Inglis B: The disease of civilisation. Granada, London, 1981, pg. 12." id="13">(13)</a>. The side-effects of cholesterol lowering drugs should be weighed against  their potential advantage, which is: "As with most primary prevention  interventions, however, a large number of healthy patients need to be treated  to prevent a single event. For cholesterol lowering, it may be necessary to treat  more than 600 patients for several years to prevent a single death or five or  six nonfatal coronary events." <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Inglis B: The disease of civilisation. Granada, London, 1981, pg. 12." id="13">(13)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Treating the heart is the least reliable and the most contentious aspect of  therapy for CAD. Drugs that "rest" the heart offer, like all cardiac drugs,  some advantage to the heart but also affect the whole body. And the transplant  option is fraught with formidable problems.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Intellectual  bankruptcy</h4>
				<p>
					The  purpose of this evaluation of the progressively ultra-sophisticated field of  cardiology is to highlight its inherently patchwork character. Cardiologists  must own up this intellectual bankruptcy. Many patients will then pause before  going broke for modern coronary care.
				</p>
				<p>
					In his monograph of the history of coronary re-vascularisation, US cardiologist  TA Preston devotes a chapter to "economic factors in coronary artery surgery".  He concludes: "Certainly if the operation were an unqualified success in  relieving the symptoms and prolonging life, it would be a justified economic  luxury despite the excess profits of some But the real question is whether the  economics of the medical situation influences the medical decision-making  process with regard to the performance of the operation. The overabundance of  surgeons, the dependence of most adult cardiac surgeons on coronary artery  surgery for most of their business, the organisation of medical health care  delivery and fee payment, and the absence of economic restraint on the consumer  are all too powerful forces that make it highly likely that coronary artery  surgery is performed more often in the United States than it would be under a  different economic system." <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Preston TA: Coronary artery surgery: a critical review. Raven Press, NY, 1977." id="14">(14)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					In closing, we draw attention to the warped thinking that the entire community-patients, doctors, scientists and journalists-has developed over the  subject of coronary care. A report in The New York Times Magazine describes a  group of cardiac patients waiting for a transplant that in 1997 cost $150,000  for the surgery and $30,000 a year for the medicines. Expectant patients wait  for "the right person" to die, praying for bad weather, and slippery roads so  that someone in sound health gets injured in the head to "become" a heart  donor. It is a macabre, but real-life death wish, for an innocent unknown  someone, so that you continue your tenuous hold on life. The writer observes  that "Eight of 10 heart transplants recipients now survive at least one year."  Surely it is ironic that the same report mentions that patients have been  waiting for a donor for as long as two and a half years. <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Siebert C: Carol Palumbo waits for the heart.

				<h4>Ethics  in cardiology</h4>
				<p>
					This  essay does not aim to be needlessly critical. The medical world desperately  needs informed patients to deal with enlightened doctors. As long as we are  around, there will be hearts in distress, part of the natural course of aging. Cardiologists  should assuage patients' symptoms and boost the morale of patients and their  families. But in order to be ethical they should also indicate that the field  is a patchwork quilt that produces a wide variety of symptoms and signs without  altering the essential course of the disease.
