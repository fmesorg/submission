					Rabies continues to be a  major problem in India even as we enter the 21st century without clear national  policies for its control, in contrast to the progress made by most other  countries in Asia. It is believed that more than 50 per cent of all rabies cases  worldwide occur in India. Our neglect of rabies may be a matter of lack of  political will or of professional competence and dedication of the public  health leadership; it is also a matter of great concern from the point of view  of violation of ethics and human rights. This latter issue is the subject of  this essay.

				<h4>Elements of rabies prevention</h4>
				<p>
					The main elements of rabies prevention are control of rabies in dogs and cats,  control of stray dogs in human habitats, post-exposure vaccination of persons  after animal bites and pre-exposure vaccination of persons at risk. Most  owners of indoor (dog and cat) pets get them vaccinated against rabies.  Domestic outdoor dogs and cats are owned usually by less affluent families and  their vaccination is often neglected. These animals are more likely to come in  contact with stray animals and are at greater risk of rabies than are indoor  pets. Stray dogs and cats are the main vectors maintaining rabies virus  circulation within human communities. Infection among them is replenished from  the sylvatic cycle of rabies virus, about which no serious studies have been  conducted in recent decades <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="John TJ, Samuel R, Balraj V.

				<h4>Controlling stray dogs</h4>
				<p>
					The problem of stray dogs has been accentuated by a government directive to  exercise restraint in catching and destroying them. Many places report an  increase in the stray dog menace and civic authorities are not taking action.  The government is responsible for both animals' humane treatment and people's  protection. If the two conflict, the government must sort things out; perhaps  only judicial involvement might clarify this conundrum. Animal bite victims can  and must take this matter to the courts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stray animals need not be destroyed to control rabies; they could be caught and  sterilised or vaccinated, preferably both. Only after the responsibilities of  the different arms of the government are clarified can we expect action from  civic authorities.
				</p>

				<h4>Rabies vaccines for post exposure vaccination</h4>
				<p>
					All civilised countries except India use safe rabies vaccines, but India  continues to use the unsafe and obsolete adult animal brain rabies vaccine. The  Semple vaccine is named after the British director of the Central Research  institute (CRI) at Kasauli, who developed the technique of preparing it at the  turn of the 20th century. The Semple vaccine replaced the Pasteur vaccine which  was made in rabbit spinal cords. Due to its inherent defect of containing large  amounts of myelin protein, it induces an allergic encephalomyelitis (AEM) in  some vaccine recipients. For this reason, most countries outside Asia adopted  other methods to grow the vaccine strains of rabies virus in duck embryo, new-born mouse brain (which has very little myelin) or cell cultures. Today all  countries (except India) that used the Semple vaccine have switched to either  cell culture or purified duck embryo vaccines; countries such as Vietnam use  infant mouse brain vaccine.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The ethical issue of vaccine safety</h4>
				<p>
					Two recent developments must be mentioned here. The rotavirus vaccine was  recently found to be associated with the development of intessusception in a  rare vaccine recipient infant. Although it is an easily treatable condition,  and though the vaccine gives excellent protection against death due to  diarrhoea and dehydration, the Food and Drug Administration of the USA directed  that the vaccine is unsafe for human use. By definition a vaccine must be safe  even if not completely effective.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second issue concerns the Sabin oral polio vaccine. The USA and several  European countries discontinued its use because it is not completely safe, and  a safe alternative vaccine is already available in the form of enhanced potency  injectable polio vaccine (eIPV). The paralytic response to the vaccine (vaccine  associated paralytic poliomyelitis) occurs in one of 400,000 subjects.
				</p>
				<p>
					AEM occurs in one in some 5,000 to 7,000 vaccine recipients. In other words,  the risk of a serious and often life-threatening neuroparalytic episode from  the Semple vaccine is nearly 100 times that of the Sabin vaccine. Thus, adult  animal brain rabies vaccine is unfit for human use and only shameless and  callous societies would continue to use it. It is unethical to inject it to any  human being, since several safe rabies vaccines are available since the 1970s.  I understand that the government under the late Rajiv Gandhi had decided to  manufacture rabies vaccine in Vero cell culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reportedly, work  including the construction of buildings, procurement of equipment and training  of personnel were virtually completed when the project stopped about two years  ago. If true, the ethical issue is even more serious, since the decision to  provide an alternate vaccine was taken and then shelved.
				</p>

				<h4>Ethics versus economics of Semple and other rabies vaccines</h4>
				<p>
					The request to discontinue the Semple vaccine and replace it with a safe  vaccine has been debated in several conferences. The government's response is  that it cannot afford cell culture vaccines. The following public sector  institutions manufacture Semple vaccine: CRI Kasauli; Pasteur Institutes at  Coonoor and Shillong; Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, Mumbai; King  Institute, Chennai; Institute of Preventive Medicine, Hyderabad; Vaccine  Institutes at Belgaum and Baroda. It is estimated that 3 million persons get  post-exposure rabies vaccine annually in India <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Park K. Park's Textbook of preventive and social medicine. Banarsidas Bhanot Publishers, Jabalpore. 1997; pp 207-214" id="2">(2)</a>. It is prepared in the  brains of adult sheep, after which the carcass and hide are discarded. Since  its shelf life is only six months, a huge quantity gets discarded each year on  account of time expiry.
				</p>
				<p>
					No one seems to have costed this operation. The excuse that it is cheap cannot  be accepted without evidence. The government may well be spending more than  what it might take to manufacture an equivalent amount of cell culture vaccine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cell culture vaccine has  a shelf life of at least two years, hence wastage would be minimal; the volume  and number of injections are fractions of what are used with the Semple  vaccine; perhaps two or three manufacturers can produce the total amount; it is  an exportable product. Moreover, the government needs to provide free  vaccinations mainly in public hospitals. In private hospitals, most people  would pay its cost. However, the government could subsidise the cost of vaccine  to the amount saved by the current expense for manufacturing Semple vaccine in  the eight centres listed above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many major hospitals see several patients each year with AEM following  vaccination with the Semple vaccine. In some instances, the vaccine was given  without necessary indication, amounting to medical negligence; however, the  victim was not compensated or even treated free of cost. In other instances the  victim was not taken back in the same place where the vaccine was given. In  most cases, the subjects had not been counselled or at least warned about the  risk of AEM, nor a choice offered, once again amounting to negligence. In some  instances, vaccination was continued despite the subject complaining of early  symptoms of reaction. In many instances, the Semple vaccine had been given in  full doses to those who had taken a full course in the past. This also is  medically prohibited, and amounts to medical negligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these unethical practices go on under the excuse that the vaccine is given  free by the government. Most victims are not highly educated or conscious of  their human and legal rights and do not have the confidence or finances to go  to court. But if the authorities do not see these issues correctly, one court case  from a victim of AEM would change the situation.

				<h4>Some practical recommendations</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Academy of Paediatrics had already strongly recommended to the  government to discontinue the use of the Semple vaccine beyond this year <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Committee on Immunisation, Indian Academy of Paediatrics. Academy matters: Update on recommendations of the Academy to other agencies on immunisation. Indian Paediatrics 1999; 36: 785-787." id="3">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It must be understood that injecting myelin-containing vaccine is a violation  of human rights and an unethical practice and should be stopped forthwith after  making alternative arrangements for sufficient safe vaccine.
				</p>
				<p>
					The extraordinary concern for animal welfare recently shown by the government  must be extended to the hundreds of thousands of sheep sacrificed for vaccine  production. There is both need and opportunity to substitute cell culture for  whole animal. What is being preached must be practiced by the government and  must be seen to be implemented.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government must revive the project to manufacture Vero cell based rabies  vaccine either in the public or in the private sector. The existing company in  India producing rabies vaccine in chick embryo cell culture could be funded for  expansion. A second manufacturing company has just been approved to produce  Vero cell based vaccine. In other words, we are not incapable of producing safe  vaccines in India. The details of subsidy and equity in distribution of vaccine  in public hospitals must be quantified and established by competent agencies  without any delay.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical personnel must be given clear guidelines for the correct use of rabies  vaccines. The Semple vaccine is overused because it is free; cell culture  vaccine must be used only according to strict protocol. This will reduce the  number of persons vaccinated. In hospitals with a large attendance of dog bite  victims, cell culture vaccine may be used in fractional doses given  intradermally, to reduce costs <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. WHO recommendations on rabies post-exposure treatment and the correct technique of intradermal immunisation against rabies. World Health Organization, Geneva. 1997; pp 1-26" id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The appropriate wing of the government must assume responsibility for the  safety of children and adults in public places such as streets, from animal  bites. It is probably cheaper to prevent stray-dog bites than to provide cell  culture rabies vaccine to bite victims. The responsibility for such safety must  be entrusted with the local administration without interference from above.
				</p>
				<p>
					Can we imagine the consequence if every dog bite victim and the family of every  victim of rabies or AME due to the Semple vaccine approached the courts for the  legitimate redressal of their grievances? Do we not have sufficient national  pride not to count a few rupees against safe biologicals? And remember, we are  a nuclear power nation, no longer a poor nation vulnerable to enemy attack. Is  not rabies our enemy too?
