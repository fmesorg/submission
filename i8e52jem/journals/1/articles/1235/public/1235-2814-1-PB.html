					Vadilal Sarabhai (VS) Hospital is the largest  Corporation-run hospital in Ahmedabad but also caters to poor patients from all  over Gujarat. Set up some 70 years ago by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the  hospital's constitution originally provided for an independent, eight-member  board, balanced between ruling corporation politicians (currently the  Congress), four permanent seats for members of two families representing the  original donors, and a member of the opposition party in the corporation  (currently the BJP). Subsequently, the balance was tilted with the inclusion of  a ninth member (representing the ruling party) with voting rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today the VS hospital draws its funds from the  Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation but continues to be independently managed by  this board of trustees.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other day, as Ahmedabad burned, frenzied mobs  stationed at the gate of the VS hospital attacked ambulances bringing injured  patients to the hospital, and stabbed a patient's relative. Later that day, a  mob rampaged through the hospital threatening patients from the minority  community.
				</p>
				<p>
					That same day, a meeting had been organised to  understand community perceptions on how the hospital's services could better  serve patients during the ongoing crisis. It was attended by leading citizens  of both communities. This included Gandhian Chunibhai Vaidya; M H Jowher,  computer consultant and social worker; and public health specialist Dileep  Mavalankar. Also present were heads of departments dealing with the bulk of  riot victims, staff, board members, and the Ahmedabad Mayor, Mr Himmat Singh,  who heads the Board.
				</p>
				<p>
					One critical issue was the total absence of  emergency and vital drugs in the hospital store. Despite a directive from the  Corporation and State government to provide free drugs and treatment to all  riot victims, neither money nor drugs had reached this cash-starved and over-burdened  institution during this crisis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Superintendent Dr Makwana had made a public appeal  for emergency drugs, surgical and orthopaedic items, and sent a requisition to  the state government a month earlier, but this had evidently not been pursued.  The hospital's drug constraints had not been communicated to the public,  and volunteers and family ran between pillar and post hoping to get free  drugs. The delays and the communication gaps left over-worked hospital staff  dealing with ugly tempers in the city's already surcharged atmosphere.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were other problems, as perceived by the  members of the Muslim community. Patients with bullet injuries received a  certificate mentioning 'injury' without specifying how it was caused.  This had grave implications for compensation or insurance claims. Patients  complained that they were discharged before it was warranted. People complained  that their relatives died unattended. Patients and their relatives had also  complained that some staff members had demonstrated prejudicial behaviour. This  had created the perception that the hospital no longer offered a safe haven to  members of the minority community, they said.
				</p>
				<p>
					During my visit to the hospital on this occasion I  met a patient who had been treated for a bullet injury and had been lying in  the terrace, for over 12 hours, in 45 degree heat. The patient said he had been  denied treatment despite instructions from the hospital superintendent. The  doctors said the patient had resisted admission and insisted on going home.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the meeting, Mr M H Jowher expressed  appreciation of the yeoman service provided by the hospital and all its staff.  He also pointed to the various perceptions of the Muslim community, and urged  the Board to improve its public relations. Allegations of communal attitudes or  behaviour warranted prompt and impartial enquiry by the administration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, Mr Jowher's comments were twisted to  imply that he was accusing all the hospital doctors of communal bias. A partial  walk-out was followed led by a corporation civil servant, BJP corporators and  some doctors. Within a few minutes the hospital union gate-crashed and  disrupted the meeting.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the power play for vote banks between the BJP  and the Congress, the hospital's secular identity is taking a severe beating.  Issues of financial viability, accountability and responsibility are taking a  back seat.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consequently, there is a widespread perception  among hospital staff, and the community living near the hospital, that the  current Congress-led Corporation is "pandering" to one community.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is also unfortunate that the medical profession  seems unwilling to take a stand against colleagues who discriminate in their  treatment of patients. In response to the suggestion that doctors were under  oath to save lives, and punishment lay in the hands of the law enforcement  machinery, one senior doctor said, "If a patient comes with hand injuries,  clearly caused by untimely explosion of country-made bombs, why should we treat  them?"
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the subversion of its meeting to build  community relations, the board's effort to confront prejudicial tendencies in  the hospital appears to have been yielded some results. Muslim social workers  reported that the hostility they earlier encountered is not so visible. The message  appears to have gone through that any person displaying bias will be held  accountable. It's a small sign of hope, and an eye-opener to the task that lies  ahead.
