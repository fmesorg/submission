					Doctors  are central and typical members of our high-technology society and have a  unique responsibility for health. That society is itself unhealthy to the point  of knowingly threatening the survival of mankind, of destroying non-western  cultures and of knowingly causing much gross and even lethal disease among its  own members. The response of doctors to the first two evils is almost  non-existent. Their response to the third, the production of disease in  individuals, consists of the late, largely unsuccessful and sometimes harmful  application of high-technology remedies to the sick persons, the remedies being  analogues of the causes. In the process doctors deprive people, sick or well,  of their autonomy in those spheres where it might properly and beneficially  operate, and give support to our unhealthy and disease-producing society.
				</p>
				<p>
					High-technology  medicine is incompatible to some extent with compassion, which is what is  needed most in the face of pain or death, both of which high-technology  medicine significantly enough, seeks not to make bearable but to control  completely and even to eliminate. Our high life-expectancy in the west is due  only in part to doctors, and is here and there now falling. Doctors neither  condemn our present life-style vehemently nor show us an alternative. Above  all, our society and its medicine being integrated, doctors cannot be absolved  from a major responsibility for the state of that society, and they are not  credible when seeking to separate the good that high-technology medicine does  from the evils produced by it and by the society of which it and they are an  integral part.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  view of all this, not to speak of many minor faults, I find western doctors  today are certainly more productive, directly or indirectly, of ill-health, in  every sense, than of health; and therefore in the terms of the brief of this  court I have no hesitation at all in finding doctors 'Guilty'
				</p>
				<p>
					That  most doctors - being often small-minded and of narrow vision - are perhaps  unwittingly guilty may be pleaded in mitigation but hardly as a defense. We  must look for hope, not to doctors, but to those, whether or not they are  medically qualified, who see the need to create a new society, of which health  will be an integral part (as ill-health is of ours); and who will search for  the philosophy, the religion, needed for the establishment of such a society. I  say 'religion' deliberately. Youth may find such a religion; its parents  hardly. The alternative is that the ill-health of our present society, its  terrible cancerous disease, will prove mortal to it, and to us and to our  children; and will ensure that our children's children shall never be born.

					<em>Editor's note:</em> This  is the concluding section from a bought-provoking book which takes the form of  an imaginary trial of the medical profession in America being conducted by a  British judge. All the points raised by the prosecution are backed by  references to real papers in established medical jourals such as <em>New England  Journal of Medicine, Lancet, and the British Medical Journal.</em>)

				<h4>Study Groups</h4>
				<p>
					You  are invited to attend meetings of the study groups being set up. The first such  group concerns itself with pharmaceuticals - choice, number, formulations,  manufacture, sales-focussing on unhealthy trends and malpractuces. The recent  displacement of Mr. Arun Bhatia, an officer of unimpeachable integrity, who was  proving a thorn in the sides of powerful drug manufacturers, from his post as  chief of the Food and Drugs Administration emphasises the need for continued  action on this front.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  group will study the rampant malpractices in medical education.
				</p>
				<p>
					Provisionally,  the groups will meet once in two months.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  need help from individuals willing to serve as group leaders. We also need  researchers and rapporteurs. Finally, as we prepare the definitive documents,  we will need help in printing and distributing them.
