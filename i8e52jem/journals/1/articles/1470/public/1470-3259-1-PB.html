					While  researching a project on the Indian woman's experience of menopause, I chanced  upon a clinic in a north Mumbai suburb with a freshly-painted board  advertising a 'Clinic for Elderly Women. The doctor (who turned out to be a  general practitioner) saying I could sit in on consultations if the patient did  not mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  patient was a 49-year-old woman, S, whose complaint was a constant body ache,  head aches, depression and a general feeling of being useless. She said she  often felt suicidal but "even that seemed like too much work." Her children had  grown up and left the house. Her husband travels frequently, leaving her alone. <em>"When  my husband is away, I am very lonely. I have nice neighbours but I miss my  family. I can't do without the TV and eat all the time. My husband tells me I  look too fat.</em>" She  believes he no longer finds her attractive.
				</p>
				<p>
					After  listening to S's litany of complaints the doctor asked her age and her  menstrual pattern. She had not menstruated for over a year. With this two brief  queries the doctor wrote out a prescription for Estriol, a lower dose (and  currently the cheapest) Hormone Replacement Therapy drug, told S to take it  twice a day and asked for a fee of Rs 175. The entire visit took barely 15  minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  doctor did not ask S about her family medical history: he did not tell her what  she was taking, the possible side effects, the need for monitoring. He simply  told her that she would get complete 'shanti' with the drug, and that she could  take it for the rest of her life, though Estriol is normally prescribed for a  three-month period with the possibility of another three months if there has  been no relief. Estriol is normally recommended to menopausal patients  complaining of common physiological symptoms of menopause.
				</p>
				<p>
					Speaking  with S outside the clinic, I asked her if there was a family history of breast  cancer or diabetes, and if she herself had gall stones (all contraindications  for HRT use). She said no, but, if someone had cancer or diabetes we would not  have known.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  doctor said it was S's first visit to him. Why did he suggest that she go on  HRT? <em>"Didn't you hear'</em>! She said she no longer menstruated. Estriol is  very good for women of this age ." Further questions about contraindications  for HRT use were dismissed with a wave of his hand. I asked him whether, in his  capacity as a GP, he felt confident about prescribing hormonal treatment. He  said, <em>"All the medical reps say it is the best thing for ageing women.  They say that every doctor buys it</em>." I asked him when he had first heard of HRT. He  said a medical representative had introduced him to it about two years ago but  he had started prescribing it only recently.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such  incidents highlight the frightening lack of knowledge amongst some sections of  the medical professsion about the contraindications of HRT. It also points to  the desperate need for counselling services. There is a growing belief that  most women would benefit more from counselling than clinical interventions like  HRT.
