					Intersex cases are rare,  and even medical personnel may not fully understand the finer nuances,  implications and complexities of such cases. The arrival of a newborn is a  highly emotional event in our country, and gender plays a key role. The birth  of a boy is greeted with great enthusiasm. Not only is the continuity of the  family assured but old age provision for parents is made. The arrival of a girl  is attended by less bonhomie, and is linked with the travails of finding a  suitable match and dowry.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Indian scenario, assigning gender is not easy, because most patients  with ambiguous genitalia may end up as females.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem is further complicated by the timing of presentation. If noticed at  birth, it is seen in the form of abnormal genitals (congenital adrenal  hyperplasia, micro penis and streak gonads). If noticed at puberty, the  symptoms are amenorrhoea, unexplained virilism (androgen insensitivity, 5 alpha  reductase deficiency).
				</p>
				<p>
					Both need a thorough diagnostic work-up before assigning gender. The latter may  have another difficulty in that the child may have been raised as a male, but  eventually be assigned female sex.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical issues in intersex disorders are as follows: assigning sex at birth;  birth registration and naming ceremony; getting investigations carried out  expeditiously; deciding on gender; timing of surgery; telling the parents the  truth; risks of malignancy, and talking to the patient.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Can we assign sex at birth?</h4>
				<p>
					This may be easy in congenital adrenal hyperplasia which also happens  to be the commonest type of intersex disorder. Only estimation of 17  alpha-ketosteroids and a female karyotype are required. In other cases like  micropenis, streak gonads, etc., a thorough diagnostic work-up is required.  This will include karyotyping, sonography, laparoscopy, genitography/scopy,  biopsy plus many sessions of talking to relatives. Assigning sex in such cases  must wait.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Birth registration and naming</h4>
				<p>
					The law requires that registration of birth be made within 40 days of  birth. This will mean naming the parents, the child and the gender. In such  cases a medical certificate attached to the registration form, helps the  parents to get more time and delay the registration.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Investigations required</h4>
				<p>
					Most investigations can be carried out in the first month of life. Some  like laparoscopy may need time, especially if the patient has associated  defects and is an anaesthesia risk. It is imperative that the anxiety of the  parents not be unduly prolonged.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other problems such as deciding on the sex of rearing, necessary investigations  and the time of operations are discussed with the following conditions:
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Female pseudohermaphrodites</h4>
				<p>
					These are genetic  females (46xx) born with hyperthrophied clitoris leading to ambiguity of  genitalia, the commonest cause being congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)  commonly caused by 2-OH enzyme deficiency.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confirmation of diagnosis is quick with demonstration of elevated plasma 17  alpha hydroxyprogesterone, with female karyotype, especially if there is a  similar history in the family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Treatment is to be instituted early with steroid replacement.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Sex  of rearing:</em> These children must be  reared up as girls, as they have an excellent fertility potential. In India one  may meet with a lot of resistance from the parents, if there is severe degree  of masculinisation of the genitalia, and if the baby is already being reared as  a boy, more so if the previous siblings are all girls. It is important for the  doctor to convince the parents about rearing the child as a girl, reassuring  them that surgery can rectify the genital anomaly.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Timing  of surgery:</em> This does not pose any  ethical problems. Reduction clitoroplasty (with vaginoplasty if necessary) can  be carried out in infancy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Male pseudohermaphrodites</h4>
				<p>
					These are genetic males (46 XY). Ethical aspects of this group of  disorders can be quite taxing to the concerned doctor. It is considered under  its respective subtypes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Complete androgen insensitivity (AIS)</h4>
				<p>
					As the external genitalia are completely feminine such a baby is not  brought to the doctor at birth. Later on, presentation may be for inguinal  hernia, or for primary amenorrhoea at puberty.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Diagnosis:</em> In a girl presenting with inguinal hernia with palpable gonad  in the hernia one should suspect intersex condition. Family history of sterile  maternal aunts would strengthen the suspicion, as would presence of scant  axillary or pubic hair in the mother. A per rectal examination is then  necessary to feel for the uterus or cervix. Karyotyping would confirm the  diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Management:</em> These children are best reared as girls as they cannot be  distinguished from normal girls at all. they develop breasts at puberty. The  only surgery they require is gonadectomy and vaginoplasty. The timing of  gonadectomy is controversial. We prefer to defer this till after puberty as  this allows for natural female development to take place at puberty as a result  of conversion of endogenous testosterone to oestradiol. In the West, most  surgeons and parents prefer to undertake surgery early with hormone replacement  therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Telling the parents:</em> How much should one tell the parents? The statement  that their daughter is actually a "boy" may shock them. If the parents are  intelligent and educated, capable of understanding, one should explain the  genesis of the condition. The most important thing is to reassure them that  their child will grow up as a "normal" girl except that she will not menstruate  and will not reproduce. She can be sexually functional with a vaginoplasty.  Also, she will have to undergo surgery after puberty to prevent malignancy in  her gonads.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Incomplete androgen insensitivity and 5 alpha reductase deficiency:</h4>
				<p>
					These children are born with incomplete masculinisation of the  genitals. Even so, some of these are reared up as boys or brought to the doctor  later on for hypospadias. Diagnosis may take time as the necessary  investigations are complex, if one has to differentiate between incomplete AIS  and 5 alpha reductase deficiency. It is necessary to differentiate between the  two as the latter get masculinised after puberty whereas the former develop  female secondary sexual characters. At times, the investigations may not be available  at all. One has to then take a decision based on size of phallus, parental  wishes and the response to depot preparation of testosterone injections.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no controversy in cases the phallus is small and response to  testosterone is poor, in allotting a female sex of rearing, with gonadectomy,  feminising genitoplasty and hormone therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The parents must be told the entire truth, that their child is genetically a  boy, but would function better as a girl. If the child has to be reared as a  boy, a urethroplasty is necessary and can be carried out around one and a half  years of age. We prefer to do it in one stage, using either Thiersch's duplex  or a buccal mucosa graft.
				</p>
				<p>
					In cases of feminising genitoplasty, reduction clitoroplasty with creation of  labia minora can be done in infancy, deferring the vaginoplasty to a later  date. The two procedures may also be combined at around one and a half years of  age.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>True hermaphrodites and mixed gonadal dysgenesis</h4>
				<p>
					These children generally present with ambiguous genitalia and arriving  at a diagnosis usually takes time, as gonadal biopsies with or without  laparotomy/ laparoscopy and karyotyping is required before conclusively proving  the diagnosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					This delay can be very trying for the parents. It is necessary for the doctors  to give the parents, some idea regarding the different possibilities. They need  to be told, that regardless of the outcome of the investigations, their child  will be managed in an adequate fashion.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Sex of rearing:</em> This is dictated by the phenotype. Children having  adequate sized phallus are reared up as boys. Surgery includes, besides repair  of hypospadias, excision of all ovarian tissue and female internal genitalia  and orchiopexy if the testes are not adequately descended and fixed. Similarly  in children with small phallus, a feminising genitoplasty is done, excising all  testicular tissue.
				</p>
				<p>
					The timing of surgery depends upon the age at which the child is brought to the  surgeon. Ideally all surgery should be over before the child starts schooling.
				</p>
				<p>
					In cases of mixed gonadal genesis, the same approach is used, excising the  streak gonad.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Fertility potential:</em> Having overcome their initial period of anxiety and  accepted the sex of rearing of their child, the parents are anxious to know the  details of future prospects of the child &ndash; regarding sexual function and  fertility potential. Fertility is unlikely in many intersex conditions, with  the exception of CAH. Some true hermaphrodities are also known to have been  fertile, but it is not wise to predict the fertility potential in other cases,  except CAH.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Cautioning parents on gonadal malignancy</h4>
				<p>
					Children with intersex disorders and/ or with abnormal sex chromosomes  are at an increased risk for development of malignancy, particularly in their  gonads. It is seen more commonly in: complete AIS, with malignant germ cell  tumours, usually in adult life; all gonadal dysgenetic disorders in patients  having a Y chromosome, who may develop gonadblastomas even in their first  decade, and mixed gonadal dysgenesis where Wilm's tumour of the kidney has a  higher incidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is of paramount importance to alert the parents of the possibility of  malignancy, occurring in later life, and hence to maintain a follow- up record.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>How much should the child know?</h4>
				<p>
					Once the child grows up, he or she may have several disturbing queries  regarding secondary sexual characters, amenorrohoea, etc. It is best not to  disclose to the patients the true nature of the underlying intersex disorder.  This may shatter adolescent patients completely, and perhaps even induce  suicidal tendencies.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the deficiencies or abnormalities can be explained to the parents, who  in turn may talk to the patient with or without the help of a psychologist.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Genetic counselling:</em> This is easy in a case where the mode of  transmission within the family is known, such as adrenogenital syndrome, an  autosomal recessive disorder, in which the chance of giving birth to an  affected child is 1: 4 and one with sexual ambiguity is 1: 8 (only the female  child will have ambiguity).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					It is clear that the ethical issues in managing intersex disorders are  very complex. Even after waiting for months to announce the birth of a child to  relatives, parents are unclear if it is a girl or a boy. They are disturbed by  the fact that if it is a boy his sexuality may be inadequate and if it's a girl  she may not menstruate or procreate. Even worse is explaining all this to the  child. In the Indian context this can be truly devastating.
