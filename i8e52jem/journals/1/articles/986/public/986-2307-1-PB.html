				<h4>Studying designs of an HPV vaccine trial</h4>
				<p>
					Defining the minimum standard of care in clinical trials is  an ethical concern, and this informs the way researchers design a trial to test  a new drug/molecule. The authors of this paper point out that given the various  counts on which a study is expected to perform successfully, designing an  ethically sound study has become a challenge in itself. This paper describes  the possible study designs of an HPV vaccine trial enrolling HIV-infected adolescent  girls in low-income settings. The designs are as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Superiority placebo-controlled crossover design: This uses  random sampling for half the study population and at the end of the three-year  period, unblinds the participants and offers the vaccine to the placebo group.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designs without untreated controls: Since the vaccine is  likely to be at least somewhat efficacious in HIV-infected adolescents, it is  offered to all participants.
					</li>
					<li>
						Designs  without untreated controls, including cohorts of HIV-infected and  HIV-uninfected girls: Here, the previous design is modified by studying  individuals in all the study arms from a similar background with the same study  endpoint.
					</li>
					<li>
						Open-label  uncontrolled trial administering three doses of vaccine to HIV-infected girls:  A cohort of HIV-infected adolescent girls is enrolled, three doses of the  vaccine are administered, information is collected on its safety and  immunogenicity, and the patients are followed up long enough to estimate the  proportion of those developing persistent HPV infection. This proportion is  then compared with published estimates from trials in older women with the same  endpoint.
					</li>
					<li>
						Superiority design randomising HIV-infected girls to four  versus three doses of vaccine: In this design, randomly selected HIV-infected  girls are given either three or four doses of the vaccine to determine if the  rate of infection in the four-dose regimen is lower.
					</li>
					<li>
						Non-inferiority  design randomising HIV-infected girls to two versus three doses of vaccine: A  randomly selected sample of HIV-infected girls is given either two or three  doses of the vaccine, on the basis of observational data from trials showing  that the efficacy of one or two doses was similar to that of the full  three-dose series.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					After considering the merits and limitations of each of these  study designs, the authors suggest that for the purpose of assessing the  efficacy of an HPV vaccine in a low-income setting, the sixth design performs  the best across most criteria. This design has the maximum scientific validity,  has no untreated controls, has specific returns for the study population, is  feasible, and provides a minimum degree of protection to all participants.  However, the first design is the most potent as far as maximum scientific  validity is concerned, though it fails to provide the minimum care to all  participants. The authors end by stressing on the moral need to design trials  that aim to achieve the best balance between scientific validity, social values,  feasibility, and protection of participants.

				<h4>Mapping the non-medical causes of maternal deaths</h4>
				<p>
					When it comes to maternal  deaths, the focus remains primarily on the medical causes and lapses. This  study was designed to understand the social/non-medical causes in two districts  of Jharkhand. The "Delay Framework" (Thaddeus and Maine) was used to map the  social causes of the deaths. An average of two deaths per month was recorded in  the area during the one-year period of the study. It emerged that none of the  women had received antenatal care, while only 10 had received the tetanus toxoid  injections. A majority of them had developed mild to severe complications  during the antenatal period, but most had sought no form of care. In some  cases, the local traditional practitioner had held on to the case till it was  too late. Referral had been made to the district hospital, which is the first  referral unit (FRU) in the area. As per the National Rural Health Mission  guidelines, an FRU should have blood transfusion facilities and be able to  provide surgical and emergency obstetric care. However, the FRUs in the area  were too ill-equipped to offer any of these and, as a consequence, routinely  referred the women to the tertiary hospital, which is in the adjoining state,  70 km away. The communities knew that the tertiary hospital had the facilities,  but could not directly seek admission there, without being routed through the  FRU; a significant number of deaths occurred on the way from the FRU to the  tertiary hospital. Also, the transport system in place - the state-sponsored  ambulance - was known to demand exorbitant amounts to transfer patients, and  families lost precious time while trying to arrange for the money. This also  meant massive out-of-pocket expenditure, which most families in these districts  could ill afford.
				</p>
				<p>
					India  has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world and is struggling  to lower it significantly by 2015 as part of its commitment to the Millennium  Development Goals. This study becomes all the more important in the light of  these facts. It is an ethical imperative for the stakeholders, especially those responsible for policy-making and monitoring of the public healthcare system,  to understand the causes of maternal deaths from all standpoints, and not see  it just as a medical issue. It is only after these social causes have been  dealt with that maternal mortality can be better addressed.

				<h4>Integrating "tobacco control" with the medical curriculum</h4>
				<p>
					Close to 70% of deaths owing to tobacco consumption occur in  low- and middle-income countries. The authors of this paper argue that making  tobacco cessation a normative part of all clinical practice is the only way to  reduce tobacco-related deaths and counter tobacco-related morbidity in the  long-run. The contact between patients and doctors is considered the point of  entry for this. It is important that doctors inform their patients about the  immediate and long-term health-related problems that tobacco users are likely  to face and, as the authors point out, the precondition for this is that the  doctors should be aware of these problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  the medical curriculum in India at present does not contain detailed  information on the dangers of tobacco use.
				</p>
				<p>
					A cross-sectional survey was conducted among all  undergraduate medical students and faculty members in five medical colleges to  assess the levels of tobacco use, receptivity to and practice with respect to  tobacco cessation, and their readiness to adopt a more comprehensive education  programme. One of the findings was that around 60% of the students (from a  universe of 2585) had started smoking after joining medical college, and the  percentage had increased over the four years. Only 20% of the medical faculty  (from a universe of 713) reported having sufficient training or experience to  help patients quit the use of tobacco. Eighty-nine per cent of the students  felt that doctors should mandatorily advise patients to quit using tobacco.  Close to 96% of the students felt that, as future doctors, it was important for  them to receive education on tobacco control, as well as training on how to  counsel patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study is timely, considering the exponentially growing  rate of tobacco-related deaths in India. Its novelty lies in the fact that it  advocates the integration of the subject of tobacco-use with the medical  curriculum. Until now, it has been the Indian state that has been concerned  with tobacco-related morbidities and has mandated statutory warnings and  graphic labels on tobacco products. If the medical fraternity is also  sensitised on this issue in depth and if doctors adopt counselling as part of  their routine interaction with patients, the problem of tobacco-related  morbidity/death would be more effectively addressed.

				<h4>ARV drugs: prioritising prevention over treatment</h4>
				<p>
					The allocation of medical resources, especially in  resource-poor settings has generated much ethical debate. This debate has  assumed greater urgency in the context of HIV and the antiretrovirals (ARVs),  especially in low-income countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa. Several  studies have argued that what is needed to end the epidemic is the adoption of  a preventive strategy rather than only a curative one. In July 2012, the US  Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Truvada (an ARV) as a  preventive. However, those on the other side of the divide argued that the  diversion of resources towards prevention rather than using them to treat the  already affected population is unfair, especially when the drug is in limited  supply. Against this background, the author asks: why should treating urgent  cases be ethically superior to preventing urgent cases in the future? The  author argues that unless effective preventive mechanisms are put in place,  treatment will always seem to require priority, simply because the size of the  affected population will never shrink enough unless prevention is prioritised.  However, the author refuses to take sides and instead, insists that it is  important to focus on the <em>context</em> before deciding to use  ARVs for prevention or cure. Here, the context would include the efficacy and  resourcefulness of the existing health system and other socio-economic  conditions. The need to generate more supporting evidence of the efficacy of  ARVs as prophylaxis in the context of different social settings is also  reiterated.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author concludes by saying that while much research is  still needed to establish the likely impact and cost-effectiveness of the  strategies for reducing the transmission of HIV, responsible implementation  would involve dedicating substantial resources to careful monitoring and  evaluation, HIV testing and counselling, raising awareness among communities,  and structural interventions to reduce vulnerability to HIV infection.

				<h4>Ethics of embryo donation</h4>
				<p>
					A  decade ago, it was estimated that the number of unused frozen embryos in the  USA was 47,000 and on an average, 45,000 embryos are cryopreserved in the UK  every year. This article supports the proposal that embryo donors can impose  specific conditions in the choice of who the recipients of their embryos should  be. The authors start from the assumption that the embryo does not have the  status of a "person" and the practice of conditional donation does not have to  be as complex and onerous to organise legally as the practice of formal  adoption. They go on to argue that conditional donation would encourage  non-anonymity and healthy contact between donors and recipients, thus making  donation a vehicle for the creation of new family relationships ("relational  model") rather than a one-off event in the clinic.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the authors oppose the view that donors should be  allowed to impose blanket conditions on the choice of recipients (denying  donation to certain races, ethnicities and people of specific sexual  orientations), and admit that in practice, it is impossible to ensure that even  people who require specific conditions always make a fair , unbiased choice.

				<h4>Models of contract motherhood</h4>
				<p>
					In this article, the authors argue in favour of a  professional model for contract motherhood or surrogacy as a third alternative  to the commercial and altruistic models, which are the subject of much debate.  In the commercial model, both parties enter into a legal agreement for personal  gain and the woman receives a fixed fee in exchange for her services. The  altruistic model is based on the gift relationship, which is not legally  enforceable. The terms of exchange are not fixed and surrogacy is motivated by  altruism. Both models appear to have their disadvantages. In the commercial  model, the woman, being motivated by monetary gain, may put the foetus at risk  if she is not satisfied. In the altruistic model, the woman is vulnerable to  exploitation by the potential parents. The authors state that since contract  motherhood satisfies the conditions required for professionalism, ie it  requires certain levels of skills and training and has a strong ethical  dimension, the professional model should be adopted, Adopting this model would  also make it possible to pay a fixed remuneration to the mothers, whose  collective interests could be safeguarded by the formation of a professional  body.
