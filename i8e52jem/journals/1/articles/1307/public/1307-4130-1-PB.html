					Bhopal is well known as  the site of the world's worst industrial disaster in 1984. It is also the  location of a medical disaster which continues to exploit the original gas  victims today. Not surprisingly, the principal authors of both are the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					Union Carbide (now Dow Chemical, following its February, 2001 merger) continues  to claim as 'trade secrets' over 60 years of research (including research on  human 'volunteers') on methyl isocyanate, the gas that leaked from the pesticide  plant. It started with Plant Medical Officer Dr Loya who immediately after the  disaster compared the poison cloud to tear gas (this in the critical hours when  the right information would have made the difference between life and death).  And it continued with people like Dr Bipin Avashia, Medical Director at Union  Carbide's US plant, who lied about the efficacy of sodium thiosulphate as a  potential detoxificant. Doctors working for Union Carbide have consistently  toed the corporate line on medical issues by focusing on their legal  implications rather than patients' interests. So you have Drs Hans Weil, Peter  Halberg and Thomas Petty &mdash; all highly qualified (and well-paid) medical  consultants from the US &mdash; visiting Bhopal as Carbide's specialists and announcing  that the victims were recovering fast without the likelihood of any long-term  complications. This within two weeks of the disaster!
				</p>
				<p>
					Loya, Avashia, Weil and others of their ilk demonstrated that their allegiance  to Mammon was stronger than to the Hippocratic oath. Can corporate doctors ever  function ethically in their profession?

					Then there is the Indian  government in cahoots with the Corporation. Government agencies have actively  colluded to underplay the number of the dead, grossly under-assess the extent  of injuries, suppress medical information, and so on. For years after the  disaster, the department of chemicals and petrochemicals banned the publication  of medical research on Bhopal. The ban was lifted in 1996 but the Indian  Council of Medical Research is yet to publish its decade-long research on  Bhopal victims. Over 80,000 people exposed to the toxic gases (and over 20,000  who were not exposed) were involved in 24 ICMR projects. Many gave samples of  their blood, sputum, urine, semen and so on. The ICMR has not even bothered to  inform them about the findings. All research on the gases' long-term health  effects on Bhopal victims has been abandoned.

					The story gets murkier  on the matter of treatment. Symptom complexes related to the toxic exposure  appear to have been identified by the ICMR but no treatment protocols specific  to these multi-systemic problems exist. Of the two official publications  resembling treatment protocols, the most recent by the ICMR is 11 years old and  covers little except the management of respiratory problems. In any case, the  medical community in Bhopal is not even aware of this document's existence. So  drugs for temporary symptomatic relief have been the mainstay of medical care  ever since the morning of the disaster. The indiscriminate prescription of  steroids, antibiotics and psychotropic drugs is compounding the damage caused  by the gas exposure.
				</p>
				<p>
					So many government hospitals have been built in Bhopal since the 1984 disaster,  that, as the International Medical Commission on Bhopal observed, there are  more hospital beds per 1,000 population here than in the USA or Europe. The  Comptroller and Accounts General's annual reports suggest that the fat  commission, and not concern for the victims' welfare, is the real motive for  building these gigantic hospitals whose expensive equipment is seldom used.
				</p>
				<p>
					The failure of state government agencies (despite spending over Rs 200 crore  from the public exchequer) to offer sustained relief has led to a proliferating  business for private doctors and nursing homes. In the severely affected areas,  most of the meagre compensation has gone to private doctors, nearly 70 per cent  of whom are not even professionally qualified, but who remain the mainstay of  medical care in Bhopal.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the Bhopal Memorial Hospital Trust, originally set up by Union Carbide,  Rajiv Bhatia, Director of Public Health, San Franscisco, audited prescriptions  given to over 400 patients. He found that many of the drugs being used by the  Trust's community clinics are doing more harm than good to chronically ill  patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other forces come in to play. A study by the Sambhavna Trust, a non-government  organisation, shows that 40 per cent of the drug market in the city's  gas-affected areas is cornered by a dozen multinational pharmaceutical  companies &mdash; including Rhone Poulenc which purchased Union Carbide's  Agricultural Products Division after the Bhopal disaster.
				</p>

				<p>
					The work done by the  Sambhavna Trust in the last five years shows that this medical disaster can be  stopped. It is possible to evolve simple, safe, effective and ethical ways of  carrying out research, monitoring and treatment within the realities of Bhopal.  However, Sambhavna is small compared to the magnitude and complexity of  the disaster. The clinic run by this trust has provided direct treatment to  about 10,000 people and about the same number through its community health  initiatives. Meanwhile, there is concern that corporate accounts and government  files will soon be closed even as some 120,000-150,000 chronically-ill  survivors struggle on.
				</p>
				<p>
					This, then, is the medical disaster in Bhopal. The ethical question today is:  what is the medical profession doing to bring Bhopal's victims out of their  17-year-long nightmare?
