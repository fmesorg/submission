				<h4>Risk of HIV from  surgeons</h4>
				<p>
					It is  now an established routine that all patients undergoing 	surgery have to be  screened for Hepatitis B and sometimes Hepatitis C, in addition to HIV.  Although it entails an additional financial burden on the patient and has its  lacunae, it is tacitly accepted by the patient. It is ostensibly meant to  prevent the surgical team from being exposed to the virus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Has not the patient  got an equal right to protect himself by asking the surgeon to have his blood  test done? I know of three surgeons who test positive for the above infections.  One is an old case of Hepatitis B and another is strongly positive. A third is  positive for Hepatitis C and suffers from pancytopenia but continues to operate  on patients with what can be called cursory precautions. In my opinion it  should be mandatory for hospitals to screen surgical staff periodically. I  invite the opinions of your readers on this issue.
