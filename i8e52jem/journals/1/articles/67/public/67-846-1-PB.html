				<h4>Abstract</h4>

				<p>
					Internationally, there is an increasing awareness of the need
					to include humanities in the medical curriculum. The Medical
					Humanities Group at the University College of Medical Sciences,
					Delhi, organised a series of events to explore this area. This
					paper describes our experience with Augusto Boal's "Theatre of
					the Oppressed" (TO). Twenty-six participants attended a 2-day
					workshop culminating in a "forum theatre", in which the spectators
					are transformed from passive observers to active participants or
					spect-actors. The participants' responses to our workshop indicate
					that TO provides a multitude of experiences and addresses a wide
					range of learning domains. TO challenges the senses and offers a
					promising and enjoyable option for learning medical humanities.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Buried in the verbiage of the document regulating graduate
					medical education in the country, the Medical Council of India
					(MCI) <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India. Salient features of regulations on graduate medical education.

Available from: http://www.mciindia.org/RulesandRegulations/GraduateMedicalEducationRegulations1997.aspx" id="1">(1)</a> does attempt to include study of the humanities in the
					MBBS curriculum. Interestingly, it is clubbed with community
					medicine. Seemingly unconnected to this, elsewhere at the
					bottom of the list of "institutional goals", personal characteristics
					and attitudes required for professional lives of graduating
					students find mention, suggesting that clarity of thinking on
					the issue is still some way off. Small wonder, then, that any
					attempt to engage the teaching fraternity in a discussion of the
					subject only manages to raise the occasional curious eyebrow,
					amid a sea of frowning disapproval. However, a Google
					search using the phrase "medical humanities" demonstrates
					that world-wide there is a gathering storm of interest in this
					discipline. Journals <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Humanities [Internet].

				<p>
					At the University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, we have

Hektoen International [Internet]. 2011 May [cited 2013 May 14];3(2)." id="12">12)</a>. This paper examines our experience with "Theatre
					of the Oppressed" (TO), a unique form of theatre devised in
					Brazil by the legendary Augusto Boal <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Boal, A. Theatre of the Oppressed.3rd ed. London: Pluto Press;2000." id="13">(13</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Boal, A. Games for actors and non-actors. London: Routledge;1992." id="14">14)</a>. Designed to
					help communities to understand their social reality and find
					solutions to their own problems, TO has been used as a tool to
					bring about change in diverse environments; however, its use
					in a medical community has not been documented.
				</p>
				<p>
					The personal characteristics and attitudes required for
					professional life specifically identified by the MCI for MBBS
					students are "personal integrity, sense of responsibility and
					dependability and ability to relate to or show concern for
					other individuals" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Council of India. Salient features of regulations on graduate medical education. New Delhi: MCI;1997 Mar 4[cited on 2013 May 14]. Available from: http://www.mciindia.org/RulesandRegulations/GraduateMedicalEducationRegulations1997.aspx" id="1">(1)</a>. Considering that these lie squarely in the
					domain of philosophy and ethics, it is interesting to speculate
					on how these ends can be achieved.
				</p>
				<p>
					We must explore how the student can be exposed to situations
					where such learning is facilitated, so that she may learn on her
					own. Importantly, to be effective, such learning, all learning
					really, must be perceived to be fun. It must not only attract the
					curiosity of the student, but must also have a lasting impact.
					The 2-day workshop in Theatre of the Oppressed that we
					organised was an attempt to achieve some of these goals.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The workshop</h4>
				<p>
					The 26 participants in the workshop included students from
					the University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS), the Army
					College of Medical Sciences and Amar Jyoti Institute of Physiotherapy, Delhi, and two members of the faculty from the
					UCMS. The sessions were conducted by the facilitator, or in TO
					parlance, the "Joker" - one who guides the group.
				</p>
				<p>
					The workshop included: (i) Introduction to Theatre of the
					Oppressed, and rules and responsibilities of the group; (ii) warm
					up games/community building exercises; (iii) image theatre
					and other structured exercises; and (iv) Forum theatre
				</p>
				<p>
					The introduction to Theatre of the Oppressed was followed by
					an important process-setting the container for the workshop
					with some "agreements" such as "listen for understanding",
					"agree to disagree", "step up/step back", "right to pass", etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the many exercises and games described by Boal <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Boal, A. Games for actors and non-actors. London: Routledge;1992." id="14">(14</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centre for Community Dialogue and Change. Promoting Theatre of the Oppressed in education. Techniques [Internet].CCDC; 2011-13[cited 2013 May 14]. Available from: http://www.ccdc.in/about-theateroppressed/ techniques." id="15">15</a>),
					the following were used in the workshop:
				</p>

				<ul "type"="disc">
					<li>
						Warm up/community building: Name playback, Cover the
						space, Fainting by numbers, 1-2-3, Zip-zap-zop, Sound and
						movement transformation
					</li>
					<li>
						Structured games and exercises: Columbian hypnosis, blind
						games including Glass cobra
					</li>
					<li>
						Image theatre: an introspective exercise for breaking the
						mind--body dichotomy, and discovering 'secret thoughts'.
						Participants explored themes such as selection into MBBS,
						your first encounter with a cadaver, classroom, religion, lack
						of passion, and good medical practice.
					</li>
					<li>
						Forum theatre: a problem-solving technique to demonstrate
						the power of a community and its collective wisdom,
						democratic processes, and critical thinking. The group
						created five short plays, after identifying recent, real and
						unresolved moments of conflict in their own lives. Two of
						these scenes (Relationship and Abandoned) were selected
						by the audience and these were then forumed - that is,
						replayed to elicit their intervention and solutions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					At the end, the participants submitted written feedback of their
					impressions of the workshop.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>
					In this section we reproduce and interpret some of the
					responses, both to specific exercises as well as to the workshop
					as a whole. The responses indicate that TO provides a multitude
					of experiences and addresses a wide range of learning domains.
				</p>
				<p>
					The games and exercises in TO act at two different but
					interrelated levels. Working with their bodies, participants
					often get new insights into themselves. The games, often
					played without words, and sometimes in silence, stir longdormant
					feelings. The cumulative effect is the possibility of a
					shift occurring in the participant, and in his/her interactions
					with others. In the context of mental health (MH), where
					communication with patients is the key focus, these effects
					work in indirect and cumulative ways to improve caring,
					empathy and communication.
				</p>

				<h5>Community building</h5>
				<p>
					Community-building exercises, played in the beginning, as
					well as in between the sessions, had a tremendous role in eliminating the apprehension of being a group of diverse
					participants from different colleges, branches and semesters.
					It introduced the feeling that interacting with strangers should
					never be difficult - an important life skill for people in the
					medical profession, helped in building instant rapport, a sense
					of togetherness and trust. Some comments by the participants
					were:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I remembered my old days, when I used to take part in plays. Also, today I was not afraid of anything.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was a very shy girl before today who was not actually able to talk comfortably. The games that we played gave me confidence to deal with a new group of people.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Participants were able to connect the games to their lives, both
					personal as well as professional. Sometimes these insights
					went quite deep. For example, as one participant put it, "There
					are things that we know, emotions that we fail to acknowledge,
					realise... like when we played 'fainting by numbers'. We all want
					someone to be always there; to catch us when we fall."
				</p>
				<h5>Structured games and exercises</h5>
				<p>
					Columbian hypnosis, a game that uses the metaphor of power,
					provoked this response from a participant: "...in an abstract way,
					how a patient gives all control over himself to a doctor and how
					a doctor should channelize it so as not to oppress the patient."
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Glass cobra</em>, among the most enjoyed of exercises, established
					that being guided by someone can be liberating. It also
					inculcated a sense of responsibility and awareness of the
					situation where participants realize that people are dependent
					on each other. The feeling of fear and vulnerability when alone
					vanishes, a real-life situation for doctors when made to play
					God. Here are some participant responses to this game:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						When I finally got hold of the shoulders of the partner I
						was desperately in search of, everything was just fine and
						relaxing.
					</p>
					<p>
						By finding my partner with my eyes closed, I actually
						started overcoming my fear.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h5>Image theatre</h5>
				<p>
					<em>Image theatre</em> is often a journey of self discovery. Some of the
					responses to image theatre were
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						During a difficult situation, my mother consulted an
						astrologer about me who said that I would become a
						teacher regardless of the profession I chose. That was
						the beginning of my self-conflict - whether to become a
						teacher or a doctor. Then, when in image theatre you gave
						the topic "classroom", I did not know how to fit into the
						group; so I automatically became the teacher. Whether my
						instinct was clouded by predictions or not remains to be
						thought out!
					</p>
					<p>
						I found out some truths about myself through the 'secret
						thought' exercise. I could feel my deepest emotions and
						fears... it filled me with energy and the fire to do this all
						over again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Doing image theatre, when I touched my teacher's feet, it
						felt great; as if it was something I had always wanted to
						do.
					</p>
					<p>
						This exercise was a perfect example of diversity in unity.
						Liberating imaginations, exhibiting group work and
						fostering interpersonal understanding, it was a life-like
						scenario resembling an operation theatre, where different
						specialists work in a team.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h5>Forum theatre</h5>
				<p>
					Forum theatre was a problem-solving exercise, which not only
					attempted to provide solutions to community problems but
					was also a self-realisation and introspective exercise.
				</p>
				<p>
					A practice forum scene during the workshop which depicted
					an eve-teasing scene on a bus evoked the following feedback:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Eve teasing is one of the most important problems I have
						faced, and I learned many things I can do to take care. Now
						I don't feel scared. If it ever happens again, I will rub it in his
						face.[sic]
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					At the end of the workshop we organised a public forum
					theatre performance for the college faculty and students. Here,
					participants not only learned from their own experience as
					actors but were also forced to adapt quickly to the changes
					incorporated by the spect-actors, inculcating the skills of
					quick judgment and decision-making required of medical
					professionals when they may be in difficulty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our forum theatre on 'Abandonment' challenged the spectators
					with a problem, shown in an unsolved form. The protagonist
					with debilitating Parkinson's disease was shown abandoned by
					family, doctor, and faith. The forum theatre methodology also
					provides a dialogic structure for deconstructing deep-seated,
					bitterly divisive issues with sensitivity and respect.
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						I will always remember playing a patient with Parkinson's
						disease. It raised my confidence to new heights. I am feeling
						more complete from inside; to the extent of making me
						aware that we are not just a body, but a body with mind
						and senses.
					</p>
					<p>
						The unprecedented outcomes suggested by the spectactors
						were awesome. I was surprised that actors could even
						change their roles because of the interventions. It was
						learning through evaluation by the community.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					Outcomes of the Forum theatre process translate back into
					community science that acknowledges and incorporates
					vital elements of local knowledge <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sullivan J, Parras J. Environmental justice and Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed: a unique community tool for outreach, communication, education and advocacy. Theory in Action. 2008;1(2):20-39." id="16">(16).</a> Below is a sample of
					feedback that attests to the therapeutic and transformative
					power of TO. It is possible to see connections between these
					deeply personal responses and their professional application:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						The part where we were asked to close our eyes and mimic
						a conflict in our lives from the past really helped me resolve
						certain unresolved issues just by thinking about them with
						so much attention.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hidden behind many of the group exercises were personal
						experiences; mine, as well as those of others. Very often a
						voyage of discovery.
					</p>
					<p>
						The games helped me understand that my structured way
						of thinking prevented me from being spontaneous.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was relieved of some of the grief and guilt that had built
						up in me for a long time.
					</p>
					<p>
						This workshop, with all of the philosophies, actually
						created, or recreated the same passion inside me to be
						what I was, and what I always wanted to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						It reminded me of my mistakes, small or large, which I
						shouldn't have made; my actions which should have been
						avoided.
					</p>
					<p>
						During this MBBS course of 'becoming God', we lose our
						humility. This workshop actually helped me're-humanise'
						myself.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					The literature has widely reported arts, literature, performing
					arts and visual arts-based interventions as tools to explore
					medical humanities <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Perry M, Maffulli N, Willson S, Morrissey D. The effectiveness of artsbased interventions in medical education: a literature review. Med Educ. 2011;45(2):141-8." id="17">(17)</a>. However there is a dearth of
					interventions whereby medical students participate actively.
					Practising under realistic conditions enables students for their
					future role as healthcare professionals. Nordstrom reported
					death notification training among Swedish medical students
					using forum theatre and found it a useful form of simulated
					learning <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nordstr&#246m A , Fjellman-Wiklund A, Grysell T. Drama as a pedagogical tool" id="18">(18)</a>. A workshop using forum theatre techniques
					was effective in training the faculty to facilitate small group
					discussions about multicultural issues <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kumagai AK, White CB, Ross PT, Purkiss JA, O'Neal CM, Steiger JA. Use of interactive theater for faculty development in multicultural medical education. Med Teach. 2007;29(4):335-40." id="19">(19)</a>. Their approach can
					be utilised to foster critical consciousness in medical education.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participating in TO is not without challenges. The literature
					reports potential for misperceptions, manipulation and
					other negative process outcomes <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sullivan J, Lloyd RS. The Forum Theatre of Augusto Boal: a dramatic model for dialogue and community-based environmental science. Local Environment. 2006;11(6):627-46." id="20">(20)</a>. Challenges of the
					implementation phase include some changes in the script
					dialogue, inconsistent icebreaker activities and lack of
					consistency from performance to performance <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fredland NM. Nurturing healthy relationships through a communitybased interactive theater program. J Community Health Nurs. 2010;27(2):107-18." id="21">(21)</a>. We were
					fortunate in having an exquisitely trained facilitator with
					remarkable commitment to her cause. Such people cannot be
					mass-produced. Introduction of TO into the medical curriculum
					on a large scale may be problematic as it requires skilled
					facilitators. Mandates, forcing MH onto reluctant medical
					educators and restrictive policies are likely to be counterproductive.
					Eventually, organisers at each institution should be
					granted the freedom to adopt what works best for them, and
					be encouraged to explore their own avenues.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the participants, without exception, the overall experience
					was positive. The authors, all of whom participated, agree that
					the workshop promoted a new bonding, trust and kinship
					among the group. This being a mixed group of students
					from different institutions and semesters and two members
					of the faculty, it was remarkable how quickly the facilitator
					could inculcate a feeling of camaraderie and provide a non-threatening atmosphere.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Indian context, with its rigid hierarchies and social
					constructs, this breaking of barriers was an important lesson to
					learn. Teachers and students are increasingly expected to cope
					with diversity in the classroom ranging from class distinctions
					to social, caste, and linguistic disparities. In our experience,
					even a single exposure to the workings of TO goes a long way
					towards the better understanding and resolution of these
					issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our experience at the UCMS, though limited, suggests that
					TO, the road less travelled, enables the participants to be
					observers as well as actors of their emotions, and thus fosters
					real communication. In summary, this article presents the
					UCMS experience with TO in our pursuit of introducing medical
					humanities to MBBS students. TO challenges the senses and
					offers a promising and enjoyable option to learning MH and
					advancing the goals set out by our policy-makers.
