					I have been reading <em>Medical Ethics</em> regularly. I find the issues tackled are topical. We should continue the newsletter at all cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was particularly impressed by the guidelines for hysterectomy in mentally handicapped women (<em>Medical Ethics,</em> May-July, 1994). They are practical and positive with sufficient safeguards against misuse of the operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have some suggestions for the dissemination of the issues discussed in the journal:
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						It should be sent gratis to all Chief Justices, State Medical Councils, leading advocates and leading, conscientious practitioners for at least a year. It may be worth sending it to some groups on a long term-basis.
					</li>

					<li>
						Advocacy appears to be proving increasingly effective in development. There are a number of groups on the lookout for causes. Could we sensitise such groups to issues in medical ethics?
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We shall have to raise funds for these purposes but that should not prove a major hurdle.
