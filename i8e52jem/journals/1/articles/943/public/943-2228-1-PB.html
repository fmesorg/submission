				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<P>
					Literature on the quality and completeness of data and
					documentation in investigator-initiated research studies is
					scarce. We carried out a study to compare the quality of data and
					documentation in an investigator-initiated trial (IIT) with those
					in an industry-sponsored study. We retrospectively studied the
					archived data pertaining to 42 patients enrolled in two trials, 14
					patients in an industry-sponsored study and 28 randomly selected
					patients from an IIT. Trial-related documents were examined and
					scored for the completeness of the acquisition of data and for
					storage as per a pre-formulated checklist. Weighted scores were
					given for each point on the checklist proportional to its relative
					importance in the data documentation process. A global score and
					sub-scores for specific modules were given for each subject. The
					scores in the two studies were compared using the Mann Whitney
					U test. The total score for general documents was similar in the IIT
					(14/14, 100%) and the sponsored study (24/25, 96%). The mean
					summary global score obtained for study-specific documents
					(maximum possible score, 32) in the IIT (27.1; 95% CI 26.4-27.8)
					was also not significantly different from that in the sponsored
					study (27.9; 95% CI 26.7-29.1; p=0.1291). Thus, investigatorinitiated
					studies carried out by independent researchers in highvolume
					academic centres, even without active data monitoring
					and formal audits, appear to adhere to the high standards laid out
					in the International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical
					Practices guidelines, ensuring accuracy and completeness in data
					documentation and archival.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<P>
					The basic tenets of the International Conference on
					Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practices (ICH-GCP) guidelines
					include the accurate capture, storage and reporting of data <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ICH Expert Working Group. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1) [Internet]. International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH); 1996 Jun 10 [cited 2013 Nov 2]. Available from: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6_R1/Step4/E6_R1__Guideline.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>.
					The importance of these guidelines in the context of providing
					vital data from clinical trials for statistical analysis has been
					stressed by other studies as well <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bargaje C. Good documentation practice in clinical research. Perspect Clin Res. 2011;2(2):59-63." id="1">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vijayananthan A, Nawawi O. The importance of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and its role in clinical trials. Biomed Imaging Interv J. 2008 Jan-Mar; 4(1):e5." id="3">3)</a>. However, despite these
					guidelines, research has shown that intensive data monitoring
					and adherence to data documentation are not yet a part of the
					conduct of clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bortolussi R, Nicholson D. Auditing of clinical research ethics in a children's and women's academic hospital. Clin Invest Med. 2002;25:83-8." id="4">(4)</a>. The documentation of data and
					accuracy of reporting are subject to regular monitoring, audits
					and inspections in an industry-funded study. Investigatorinitiated
					research, on the other hand, is not subject to such
					rigorous monitoring and may never undergo a formal audit
					or an inspection. Several publications have highlighted
					the importance of, and raised concerns over, adherence to
					methodological quality and the quality of reporting of research,
					both in industry-funded and investigator-initiated trials <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Taghinia AH, Liao EC, May JW Jr. Randomized controlled trials in plastic surgery: a 20-year review of reporting standards, methodologic quality, and impact.

					Despite an extensive search of the literature, we were unable to
					find any study which compared the quality of documentation
					in investigator-initiated research with that in industry-funded
					research. Hence, we conducted a study to compare the quality
					and completeness of documentation in an investigatorinitiated
					randomised trial of two types of lymph node
					dissections for oesophageal cancer (with one of the authors,
					C S Pramesh, as the principal investigator) with an open-label
					industry-funded study of the use of granulocyte colonystimulating
					factor in the treatment of febrile neutropenia
					induced by cancer chemotherapy.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<h5>
					<li>
						Ethics
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						We initiated the study after obtaining the approval of the
						institutional ethics committees of the institutions concerned.
						Both the sponsored and investigator-initiated studies were
						conducted at the Tata Memorial Hospital, which is a highvolume
						tertiary referral centre for the treatment of cancer
						in India. The principal investigators in both studies were
						experienced in clinical trials and had already participated
						in more than 10 research studies (both IITs and industrysponsored
						trials). A request was made for the waiver of
						consent and this was granted on the grounds that the study
						was retrospective and no confidential information about
						the patients would be made public. Unique identifiers,
						which were pre-coded, were used for all patients. Prior to
						the initiation of the study, permission was taken from the
						principal investigators of both studies, as well as the sponsor
						of the funded study.
					</p>
					<h5>
					<li>
						Methodology
					</li></h5>
					<p>
						In the industry-funded study, a total of 14 patients were
						recruited from the Tata Memorial Hospital. In the investigatorinitiated
						study, 28 patients were randomly selected from a
						total of 200 patients with the help of a random number table.
						The ratio for comparison between the two studies was thus
						1:2. We drew up a checklist consisting of various criteria that
						are important in trial documentation. We classified these as
						general documents (Table 1) and patient-related documents
						(Tables 2-4). All were examined and scored for completeness
						of data acquisition and archiving. Each point on the checklist
						was given a weighted score, which was summated into a global score for each patient. We also calculated sub-scores
						for specific modules in the documentation (Table 4). As
						the investigator-initiated study was a surgical trial, some
						parameters were not applicable and, therefore, were not
						considered for scoring. The data were checked for normality
						using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and analysed using the
						Mann Whitney U test. Graph Pad InStat, Version 3.10 was used
						for all analyses which were done at 5% significance.
					</p>
				</ol>

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					The scores for general documents are listed in Table 1. The
					maximum score possible for the investigator-initiated study
					was 14 and that for the sponsored study, 25. The IIT scored
					14/14 (100%). and the sponsored study, 24/25 (96%) Thus,
					there was barely any difference with respect to the general
					documents. Table 2 provides the details of the patientrelated
					documents and is subdivided into (i) admission
					criteria, (ii) informed consent form, (iii) case record form, (iv)
					source documents, and (v) protocol and safety reporting. The
					maximum score was 28 for the IIT and 14 for the sponsored
					study for all the subdivisions, except the subdivision of the
					reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) to the ethics
					committee, sponsor, regulator and follow-up reporting, for
					which the maximum score was 56 in the case of the IIT and
					28 in the case of the sponsored study. Thus the maximum
					possible score for the investigator-initiated study was 896 and
					that for the sponsored study was 448. The scores obtained
					were 760/896 (84.8%) and 390/448 (87%), respectively. Table
					3 gives the global score for patient-related documents. It
					may be seen that the score for the investigator-initiated
					study ranges from 23.5 to 29.5 and that for the sponsored
					study from 23.5 to 30. The mean summary global score
					for patient-related documents (Table 3) obtained in the
					investigator-initiated study (27.1; 95% CI 26.4-27.8) was also
					not significantly different from that in the sponsored study
					(27.9; 95% CI 26.7-29.1); (p=0.1291, Mann Whitney U test).
					The points assigned for individual parameters, the sub-scores
					for specific modules and the global score obtained for each
					trial are shown in Table 4. While the global scores were not
					significantly different, a difference was seen in the sub-score
					of informed consent, with the investigator-initiated study
					scoring 78.3% and the sponsored study scoring 84.8%.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					The ICH-GCP has provided guidelines for data documentation,
					archival and reporting <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="ICH Expert Working Group. ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1) [Internet]. International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH); 1996 Jun 10 [cited 2013 Nov 2]. Available from: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6_R1/Step4/E6_R1__Guideline.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>; however, adherence to these is
					not as frequently emphasised as adherence to guidelines
					relating to ethics and the actual conduct of the study. This
					might be a bigger problem in investigator-initiated research,
					as monitoring is not as strict as in sponsored studies. A large
					investment, in terms of finances and resources, has to be
					made by investigators in order for trials to strictly comply with
					the GCP guidelines <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sweatman J. Good clinical practice: a nuisance, a help or a necessity for clinical pharmacology? Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003;55:1-5." id="7">(7)</a>. Sponsored studies employ qualified
					and trained staff, as well as monitors, to carry out intensive reviews and arduous monitoring of the proceedings of a trial.
					In investigator-initiated and non-commercial studies, the
					existing staff members are usually responsible for monitoring
					and review, which they carry out together with their regular
					duties, as cost constraints do not permit the use of additional
					manpower. Despite the hurdles that the investigator has
					to face, there is no alternative to accurate and diligent data
					collection, storage and reporting, the absence of which can
					significantly alter statistical analysis and interpretation, thus
					affecting the results of the trial <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chan AW, Altman DG.

					Our study found that there was no significant difference
					between an investigator-initiated and an industry-sponsored
					trial in terms of the quality and completeness of data
					documentation (Tables 1-4). All areas of data documentation
					and archival were found to be quite comparable in the two
					trials. This shows that in trials in institutes where a high
					volume of studies is conducted, data documentation and
					archival can be done with similar rigour to that in industrysponsored
					studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The informed consent form was one area in which a difference
					was observed. As can be seen in Table 4, the sponsored study
					fared better (78.3% for the investigator-initiated study versus
					84.8% for the sponsored study). The informed consent process
					is the cornerstone of sound ethical and scientific research and
					has been the subject of numerous studies, both in developed
					and developing countries. The signature of the investigator,
					along with the date of the consent process, ensures the
					adequacy and completeness of the informed consent
					process. A previous study has shown that issues related to
					the informed consent process are the third most common
					reason for the United States Food and Drugs Administration
					(US FDA) issuing warning letters to investigators <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gogtay NJ, Doshi BM, Kannan S, Thatte U. A study of warning letters issued to clinical investigators and institutional review boards by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Indian J Med Ethics. 2011 Oct-Dec;8(4):211-14." id="9">(9)</a>. In both
					studies, there was no documentation of the photocopies
					of the informed consent form having been given to the
					participants (Tables 3 and 4). While this may simply have been
					a lapse in documentation, it still indicates that the informed
					consent process is an area that needs to be addressed and
					strengthened by all the stakeholders.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study had certain limitations. A comparison was made
					of only one study from each category, the investigatorinitiated
					and sponsored type. This was because in the case of
					industry-funded studies, the sponsor's approval was required
					for analysing the data and only one sponsor from the several
					that we contacted permitted analysis of his study. This limited
					the generalisability of our results. Further, the investigators in
					the two studies were different. A more accurate interpretation
					would have been possible if trials conducted by the same
					investigator had been analysed. Our study focused only
					on the quality and completion of documentation in the
					two studies; it did not assess the actual conduct of the trial.
					We compared a surgical trial (investigator-initiated) with a
					medical one (sponsored study). The weight of responsibility
					on the investigator handling the surgical trial may have been relatively greater due to increased concern about the
					patients' safety, resulting in the use of higher standards in
					the conduct of the study. There is also a possibility of the
					introduction of a bias due to the fact that one of the authors
					was also the principal investigator of the investigator-initiated
					study. Finally, the results could have been influenced by the
					extent of training received by the principal investigator in
					clinical research and his experience in conducting clinical
					trials. Notwithstanding these limitations, we do feel that the
					results of our study are important as very few data exist on
					the subject.
				</p>
				<p>
					This study has shown that researchers in academic settings
					adhere to the high standards of the GCP, since hardly any
					differences were observed between the IIT and the trial
					sponsored by a pharmaceutical industry. This is important,
					considering that investigator-initiated studies are associated
					with lower running costs than sponsored studies <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bergmann L, Berns B, Dalgleish AG, von Euler M, Hecht TT, Lappin GL, Reed N, Palmeri S, Smyth J, Embacher-Aichorn S, Zwierzina H, Biotherapy Development Association. Investigator-initiated trials of targeted oncology agents: why independent research is at risk? Ann Oncol. 2010 Aug;21(8):1573-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdq018. Epub 2010 Feb 4." id="10">(10)</a>. We,
					however, cannot deny the importance of sponsored studies
					as investigators who have already conducted one are
					experienced and hence, are more likely to adhere to GCP
					guidelines while conducting their own trial. Be that as it may,
					investigators could improve the quality and documentation
					of their research by employing internal monitors and
					applying for additional funding for their studies, either within
					their own institutes or to governmental agencies. In this way,
					external, independent monitors could be appointed and data
					checked periodically. Institutional review boards, too, should
					regularly monitor investigator-initiated research as a part of
					their activities. This would help ensure that issues related to
					the consent process and the general conduct of the trial are
					picked up early on in the course of the study, and training and
					retraining of the staff can be carried out. Finally, researchers
					should realise that the GCP are essentially and will remain
					an attitude and approach towards the conduct of research,
					and must be the same regardless of whether the research is
					sponsored (and, therefore, heavily monitored) or investigatorinitiated.
