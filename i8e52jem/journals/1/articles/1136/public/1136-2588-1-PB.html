				<h4>Surgical training in India</h4>
				<p>
					The letter on surgical training in India <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajappa S, Menon PG. Surgical training in India--a long and winding road. Indian J Med Ethics. 2010 Apr-Jun;7(2):126." id="1">(1)</a> ought to open the eyes of surgical teachers in myriad departments in the country. In the absence of a structured theory and practical curriculum, it is left to the devices of teachers and their goodwill, the enthusiasm of students and their willingness to learn, and certain other factors. All this together is not enough to produce a surgeon with standard skills and knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					The lack of standardisation across country produces "surgeons" of varied skills and competence. Teachers have their fads and hobbies and often neglect certain areas. In many departments, teaching activities like seminars, case presentations, journal clubs, mortality morbidity conference are given the go by.
				</p>
				<p>
					About private medical colleges offering surgical training, the less said the better.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was my good fortune to visit the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan in Karachi some years ago. There I was surprised to see a formal surgical laboratory with mock surgical tables covered in green cloth where trainee surgeons were taught basic and advanced surgical skills in two courses covering a few days each.
				</p>
				<p>
					The course had a formal curriculum and attending the course was mandatory for all surgical trainees in the country, regardless of their place of training. Special models were made for trainees to practise procedures like tracheostomy, vene-section. Suturing and ligature were taught on models. Bowel anastomosis was taught on preserved bowel segments.
				</p>
				<p>
					All trainees underwent a course in using computers, presentation skills and research methodology. It is my belief that such a system of training does not exist in our country. There is much to learn from our colleagues across the border.
