				<h4>An obsolete oath?</h4>
				<p>
					Does Hippocrates have noth ing to say to the modern  health professional? This writer argues that developments in medical  technology, the growing importance of public health, the growth of private  insurance, and a range of social changes all combine to challenge the  principles contained in the Hippocratic oath. Powerful new interventions often  do some harm; the absolute regard for life has been challenged by the dilemmas  posed by high-tech techniques, and private insurance and public health demands  have together eroded the notion of privacy. He suggests that doctors and  society must get to grips with the ethical consequences of the medical  revolution.

				<h4>Publication ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The writers looked at whether medical journals have  improved their standards requiring researchers to describe the protection given  to participants in clinical trials, in terms of mentioning whether informed  consent was taken from participants, and whether ethics committee approval was  sought and obtained. They compared 60 articles in each of five major general  medical journals, for 1995-1999. While these journals improved their reporting  of these two ethical requirements, 9% of studies still report neither informed  consent nor ethics committee approval.

				<h4> All about the kidney trade... </h4>
				<p>
					The fortnightly Frontline has carried a number of  investigations on the kidney trade. The site (<a href="http://www.flonet.com/" target="_blank">www.flonet.com</a>) now has  a collection of articles on the subject, which make up an excellent reference  source (www.flonnet.com/ktrade.htm), with reports on  networks in various parts of the country, a feature on a 'one-kidney community'  of donors, articles on the law and on cadaver programmes. In an essay on the  case for a 'regulated kidney trade', the writer gives a brief outline of  perspectives of the World Medical Association and other international and  national bodies, and non-governmental organisations. She presents the arguments  in support of organ sale, and the response to these arguments, drawing from  academic debates, decisions of the World Medical Association and other  organisations, and the experiences of medical professionals. She concludes:  "New-fangled arguments for a paid-donor system cannot override its proven  negative social and ethical consequences and implications."

				<h4>Trying to bridge the 'donation  gap' </h4>
				<p>
					The kidney trade in India sabotages efforts at establishing  a cadaveric organ transplant programme. The USA has a cadaveric programme, but  although three out of four people asked say they would wish to donate, when  actually asked for consent for donation of a relative's organs, only half of  those asked agree. The US still faces a crisis in donations, resulting in about  4,300 deaths in 2001. This leads to desperate patients buying organs from  outside the country. Efforts to promote donation include improving public  awareness, scrutinising existing approaches to getting consent from relatives,  incentives and even payments. This report discusses efforts to improve the  manner in which patients' relatives are approached for consent. A study of 420  families found that those who spent more time discussing donation with organ  procurement organisation staff were more likely to consent, as were families  who were asked to make a decision only after such discussions. The more radical  approach of presumed consent, in which all deceased patients become potential  donors, has not been taken up at the policy level.

				<h4>Ethical incentives to organ  donation</h4>
				<p>
					n This essay considers the possibility of giving incentives  to promote organ donation. This suggestion is made in the context of a growing  reliance on living donation &mdash; and the attendant risk of financially motivated  donation. The authors argue that both presumed consent and mandated choice  (requiring all citizens to state whether or not they will donate) have  limitations in a country such as the US. The existing shortage also leads  people to the black market for organs. Though the National Organ Transplant Act  prohibits the selling/buying of organs, for-profit companies have already  become processors of other transplantable tissues. Many bills are in the  pipeline to promote donation; some effectively legalise payment for organ  donation. They suggest other ethical incentives to increase organ donation &mdash; from  both, living donors and from cadavers &mdash; which would not amount to payment.  These could include some kind of public honour, a small reimbursement for  funeral expenses, medical leave for organ donation, and life and disability  insurance for donors. Tax credits or refunds &mdash; both suggestions made in  proposed legislation &mdash; are effectively payments, which the authors oppose.

				<h4>Unequal medical care</h4>
				<p>
					"In almost every nation in the world,  increased burdens of morbidity and mortality afflict racial and ethnic  minorities and new immigrant populations." While poverty and poor access  play a role in this situation, the author also points to research findings that  minorities who do use the system are also treated differently&mdash; from the quality  of work-up, to getting specific procedures, or medications &mdash; even when factors  such as age, sex, economic status and insurance coverage were taken into  account. There is evidence in some studies that the patients who were denied  appropriate or necessary care included some who were at greatest risk, and who  suffered accelerated mortality consequently. This goes against the commitment  to equal care for all. Of the many possible reasons for this disparity, the  writer argues that physician bias affecting clinical decision-making, and  cultural incompetence, are the most directly remediable. Both the US and the UK  have taken steps to address racism in health care. Medical students are also  being trained to work in multi-cultural settings. Most examples of uneven  treatment are not to do with conscious bias, but the indirect results of time  pressures and the complex nature of the job. Also, health care workers will  reflect the biases in mainstream society and the culture of medicine. Reducing  racially or culturally based inequity in medical care is a moral imperative.

				<h4>Racism in medicine</h4>
				<p>
					This book review of Racism in medicine, by a UK  physician of Asian descent, presents another facet to the issue of racism in  medicine, relevant to India. The author states that the book provides ample  evidence of racism within the health services &mdash; directed at patients by health  professionals, at students by teachers, at health professionals by their  colleagues as well as by patients. The profession cannot afford to be  complacent about the problem; nor can it wait for more research. What is needed  now is a sense of responsibility to change the situation, and action to  implement existing legislation.

				<h4>Doctors in conflict</h4>
				<p>
					A UK doctor on his way to volunteer in the  emergency department of a Palestinian hospital for the Palestine Red Crescent  Society was denied entry 'for security reasons' and deported from Tel Aviv  airport. He wrote on the wall of the holding cell: "I was denied entry  because I came to give humanitarian assistance... My duty as a doctor is to  give help to those in need, irrespective of race, nationality, religion, or  political beliefs. That includes Palestinians." As a result of the Israeli  government's policy, 2,000 humanitarian aid workers and human rights activists  were barred from entering Israel in a month; 50 were deported.

				<h4>Health care workers and war</h4>
				<p>
					What can health care workers do about the threat of  war? This is certainly an urgent task before the medical profession in this region.  The writers believe that doctors can support efforts to prevent the use of  certain weapons (such as nuclear or biological weapons), draw public attention  to the health effects of war; support efforts at peace-making. Also, they can  support the rehabilitation of all those affected by war, by building an  equitable, accessible healthcare system. Doctors should use their skill  "in maintaining the well being of humans, as well as our legitimacy as  healthcare workers, to seek medical, social, and political solutions that help  eradicate or limit this disease that afflicts humanity."

				<h4>Case studies on health and human  rights</h4>
				<p>
					The skills of physicians, medical and forensic  scientists, and other health workers are uniquely valuable in human rights  investigations and documentation, producing evidence of abuse more credible and  less vulnerable to challenge than traditional methods of case reporting.
				</p>
				<p>
					This article presents case studies from the field  missions of Physicians for Human Rights on investigation and documentation of  violations of medical neutrality, refugee health crises, use of indiscriminate  weapons, torture, deliberate injury, rape, and mass executions. Participation  of health workers in the defense of human rights now includes investigation and  documentation of health effects in threatened populations as well as individual  victims.

				<h4>Doctors at the time of Apartheid </h4>
				<p>
					This report documents the role of white health  professionals in South Africa during a time of state-supported racism ignored.  It finds that they supported Apartheid in violation of international medical  standards, by refusing treatment; falsifying medical records to cover up  evidence of torture; turning over wounded political demonstrators, without  treatment, to the security forces, and violating patient confidentiality to  cooperate with security forces. "The conduct of the leaders of health  professional organisations was in many respects the most egregious of  all," the report concludes.

				<h4>Changing responsibilities </h4>

					Health professionals can "apply their skills  and knowledge in many increasingly complex emergency settings," write the  editorialists. They have documented the health consequences of human rights  violations, to establish criminal responsibility and to prevent them from being  repeated, usually through case testimonies.This editorial comments on a study  to establish patterns of human rights violations among Kosovar refugees by  Serbian forces.

				<h4>Nepal doctors in a bind</h4>
				<p>
					Since the declaration of a state of emergency in  Nepal on Nov 26, 2001, freedoms of expression, association, and movement have  been suspended. Security forces have arrested many civilians...On March 16, 2002,  Mahesh Maskey, a member of Physicians for Social Responsibility, Nepal, was  arrested on his way to attend a conference in New Delhi, India... and was  released only after pressure by national and international human rights groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					More than 2,850 people have been killed in the  6-year conflict between rebel Maoist groups and the government. Since  mobilisation of the army, there has been a high casualty rate among government security  personnel, members of the armed rebel groups, and civilians. Health  professionals are under pressure and scrutiny since both sides want to use  their skills to treat their wounded. In addition, the ethical right of health  professionals to practise medicine without prejudice has come under threat  through a recent government directive which requires all health professionals  and institutions to immediately inform Security Officials about any wounded  individuals seeking medical assistance. If treatment is provided without  appropriate notification, they will be regarded as supporters of terrorists and  be prosecuted. Jeetendra Mahaseth of Nepalgunj Medical College Hospital was  arrested and kept in isolation for 19 days because he had provided treatment to  at least one wounded member of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). The  directive violates international ethical standards set by the World Medical  Association...
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical professionals are in an impossible situation:  ...they are at risk of encountering armed groups demanding treatment for their  wounded; but providing treatment might lead to subsequent government  prosecution.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nepal Medical Council, the only national body  ensuring medical ethics, has remained silent. Nepal Medical Association, the  national professional organisation of medical doctors, so far has written only  one letter of concern...
