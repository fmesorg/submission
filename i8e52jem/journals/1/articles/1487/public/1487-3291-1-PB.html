					Contracting tuberculosis, and not getting treatment, in prison can be considered cruel and unusual punishment
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Throughout  the world societies deprive individuals of their liberty in response to real or  perceived misdemeanors. Such persons are held in a number of institutions,  their names varying from country to country, and according to what stage of the  judicial system these persons are passing through. For clarity, I will refer to  the sites of incarceration as prisons, and persons in custody as prisoners.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are no accurate data on the number of persons in the world's prisons - current  estimates vary from eight to ten million. The number of persons passing through  prisons in a given year is at least four to six times, and the number held in  police detention over ten times that number. (i. e. up to 100 million persons  annually).
				</p>
				<p>
					Prisoners  are not representative of the general community. Many selective processes  operate to transfer a citizen into a prisoner - many of these factors influence  the epidemiology of tuberculosis in prisons. Prisoners are predominantly male,  young (15-44 years old), and belong to minority groups (with resultant poorer  socio-economic status, poorer education and work prospects). It is these  community subgroups who have a high risk of exposure to infection to  Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Human  rights derive from the dignity of the individual. They are by definition,  universal and indivisible. Minimum levels of health care, accommodation and  diet for every prisoner are goals that should be pursued by every state. These  principles are clearly laid out in the Convention against Torture and other Cruel,  Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984).
				</p>

				<p>
					Public health and prison health officials face many dilemmas in delivering  services that may challenge, or even impinge on, prisoner rights and human  rights issues. These dilemmas are more extreme, the poorer the country and the  fewer the resources allocated to prison health.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resource-poor  countries with high tuberculosis burdens face many problems which work against  the provision of a comprehensive anti-tuberculosis program including, low- level training of health-care workers, provision of poor salaries (or non- payment of salaries), chronic shortages on medications, and high levels of  corruption. Prisons accentuate all these circumstances.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  resource-poor countries, where the custodial bureaucracy is often closely  aligned to the military-police apparatus and their funds, an independent prison  health service may not be achievable. Certainly prisons in resource rich  countries would benefit from added independence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given  that the health of prisoners impacts on that of the general community, the  disposition of a health ministry would conceivably be more favourable toward  the prison population. Also, prison health finds a place within the national  health priorities, on every health indicator where prisoners are certain to be  more needy.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  important is that the prison health service, and particularly its medical  staff, has adequate resources and enjoy professional independence. Where  resources are limited, those that are available should be distributed to those  in greatest need, in a transparent manner.
				</p>

				<h4>Prisons  and tuberculosis</h4>
				<p>
					Prisons  present both risks and opportunities for tuberculosis control. A necessary  condition for an effective control program includes a functional health service  within the prison, which is accessible to all prisoners.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prisons  are a recognised setting for transmission of tuberculosis. Prisons impose a  risk for tuberculosis transmission independent of the predisposing risk factors  of the prison population.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  can be no adequate control of tuberculosis within a country, without control of  the disease inside the prisons. Prisons are an important source of both  tuberculosis disease and tuberculosis transmission. Tuberculosis infection  contracted in the community can initiate an epidemic when brought into the  prison, while the reverse route of transmission is equally possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					The high turnover of prisoners can make tuberculosis transmission difficult to  demonstrate, and difficult to investigate. Remand prisoners are often held in  the most overcrowded conditions. This not only enhances transmission of  tuberculosis, but it also makes the detection of cases and their treatment more  difficult. All the more important to prevent transmission, as control is extremely  difficult in the midst of an epidemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prisons  are a setting where HIV and tuberculosis meet. In some countries up to 70 per  cent of prisoners with tuberculosis are also infected with HIV. All testing for  HIV must be done with the same degree of confidentiality and pre/ post-test  counseling, irrespective of any imperative to link the results to a  tuberculosis programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					Because  of the almost universal criminalization of drugs, drug-users constitute a  large, and increasing, proportion of prisoners. Many illicit drug users live on  the fringes of society, with little opportunity for regular work and income,  have poor access to an adequate diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and have  poor access to health care. This complex of factors ensures maximal chance of  exposure to tuberculosis, optimal conditions for infection to progress to  infectious disease, and minimal opportunity to proper, early diagnosis, and  treatment to the point of cure. Prisons are a setting where HIV and  tuberculosis meet. As illicit drug-use is directly linked to other activities  that result in arrest and detention, these risks are easily transferred into  the prison environment.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Prisons,  tuberculosis and human rights</h4>
				<p>
					The  rights accorded to prisoners are codified in the United Nations Standard  Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Because proper diagnosis and  treatment of tuberculosis are life saving, a tuberculosis control program  should be an inseparable component of a prisoner's minimum rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					No  incarcerated individual should bring tuberculosis into the prison; no prisoner  should be exposed to tuberculosis while in prison; and no former prisoner  should take tuberculosis from the prison environment back to the community.  With the re-emergence of tuberculosis as a major health hazard, similar  pre-emptive measures, (i. e. prolonging prisoners' sentences in the event that  they have not completed antituberculosis treatment when due to be released)  could become widespread. Prisoners who know that their effective stay in prison  will be prolonged because of their illness will go to great lengths to get  "off" a tuberculosis program. This could also be counter-productive, with  prisoners falsifying sputum samples in order to avoid the extension of  sentences.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  custodial authority needs to provide the facilities and the means to prevent  transmission of tuberculosis (prison to the community; community to the prison;  within the prison). Because tuberculosis is an infectious disease, the  importance of instituting excellent tuberculosis control programs in prisons  embraces not only the prison population (prisoners and staff), but also the  general community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tuberculosis  may be the single biggest cause of death among the world's prisoners. But a  word of caution. Reports of deaths from "tuberculosis" have been used to  conceal other serious human rights abuses, such as malnutrition, murder and  deaths from torture. Holger Sawert equated surveillance with accountability.  Disease surveillance systems in prisons are at best rudimentary. As a start,  all countries should report tuberculosis cases in prisons within their national  data. Only then can the "truth" about tuberculosis in prisons be verified.
				</p>
				<p>
					Public  health legislation in many countries includes measures that allow long-term  detention of tuberculosis patients who do not comply with treatment. This is a  clear contravention of human rights, where incarceration is used to compensate  for failures of the public health system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tuberculosis  has not attracted much attention in the human rights literature, nor has the  association between tuberculosis and human rights been examined in detail in  the medical literature. This is surprising given the epidemic proportions of  the disease, and its disproportionate distribution in resource-poor countries,  and within these countries, the disenfranchised poor. This contrasts with  extensive work on the area of HIV / AIDS and human rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under  human rights law, a state's treatment of its own citizens becomes a subject of  international concern. This principle holds that states that treat their  citizens poorly would pose a threat to other countries. Even more so, when  public health is a concern - as it is with tuberculosis, which neither respects  the boundaries of a prison wall, let alone a national boundary. States are accepting  international scrutiny - but not yet in the context of tuberculosis control.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not  least because tuberculosis is curable, the emphasis with tuberculosis control  is the issue of "equivalence" of access to health care.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					It is  ironic that society condemns transgressors to imprisonment, because they are  considered harmful - and by doing so, a greater harm may be reflected back onto  the community. Tuberculosis provides another contradiction to imprisonment -  one with a public health imperative.
