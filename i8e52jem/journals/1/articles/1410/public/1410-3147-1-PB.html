				<h4>Abortion death</h4>
				<p>
					On March 10, Monita  Bhardwaj died in Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, following an abortion. The post-mortem report clearly indicts the doctors treating her, according to Dr KL  Sharma, one of the panel of doctors conducting the PM. Monita was taken in for  the procedure around 11.30 AM. Half an hour later, her husband was told she had  died of an epileptic seizure. When he got agitated, doctors told him he should  be grateful for the death certificate, considering the marriage was just a year  old. When he persisted in his efforts to register a medico-legal case  registered, his in-laws were advised to register a case against him for dowry  harassment.

				<h4>Persistence may pay</h4>
				<p>
				Following the Supreme Court's directive to reopen the case pertaining  to a person's death in 1985, three doctors face charges of criminal negligence.</p>
				<p>Farhad Ali Khan was injured in a road accident, and admitted to the Magadh  Medical College and Hospital in Bihar, where he died due to excessive bleeding  a few hours later. The complainant, Farhad's uncle, said the head of surgery  was supposed to be on emergency duty when the accident victim was admitted but  was not present, and did not examine him even later. The head of the department  of orthopaedic surgery advised attendants to shift the patient to his private  nursing home instead. A third doctor reported three and a half hours late for  emergency duty and did nothing while the patient bled profusely. Thereafter,  hospital records were allegedly tampered with to create evidence that Farhad  had been properly treated. </p>

				<p>
					When a criminal complaint was dismissed, as was an appeal against the  dismissal, the complainant moved the supreme court, which asked the high court  to pass a 'speaking order' giving its reason for accepting or rejecting the  findings. On September 16, 1999, the Patna high court directed the trial court  at Gaya to put the three doctors on criminal trial on the basis of the  complaint.

				<h4>Transplant panel in Mumbai</h4>
				<p>
				A zonal transplant coordination centre has been set up at the LTMG  hospital in order to give fresh impetus to the organ transplant programme and  coordinate between hospitals involved.</p>
				<p>After the Human Organ Transplantation  Act was passed in 1994, major hospitals were inspected and permitted to carry  out organ transplants. Th act was to stop the illegal sale of kidneys. Live and  related transplants were to be screened by an authorisation committee to ensure  there was no commercial deal. However, most hospitals used the permission to  carry out only live and related transplants and there was hardly any serious  effort to carry out cadaver transplants. There has not been a single kidney  cadaver transplant in Mumbai since July 1999. There was no initiative from  individual hospitals to promote cadaver transplants. The committee will ensure  equitable distribution of organs from cadavers by maintaining a central  registry at LTMG hospital. Criteria will be laid down for the distribution of  organs and a waiting list drawn up, without exceptions. The zonal committee  will monitor all cadaver transplants to see how the procedure can be improved.  Efforts will also be made to increase public awareness so that patient  suffering need not be prolonged. </p>

				<h4>Presumed consent</h4>
				<p>
				The British Medical Association has launched a campaign to increase the  number of organs available for donation through a system of "presumed consent,"  which assumes that every patient wished to be a donor unless he or she had  registered an objection. However, doctors would have the discretion not to  proceed if the potential donor's wishes are not known and donation would cause  major distress to a first-degree relative or long-term partner.</p>
			  <p>Waiting lists  for transplants have grown without any corresponding increase in the number of  transplants, and in the second half of the 1990s, 1,000 patients died while on  the waiting list.</p>
				<p>The association calls for the "introduction of a single,  comprehensive, piece of legislation covering all aspects of organ donation-from both live and cadaveric donors"; the use of invasive procedures on dead  patients to protect organs till they are transplanted; a 24 hour telephone help  line to answer questions related to organ donation, and changes to current  training to overcome the shortage of transplant surgeons.

				<h4>Drug trial deaths</h4>
				<p>
				South Africa's HIV/AIDS drug trials industry was thrown into confusion  after the government had to stop a trial in which five patients died, 11 per  cent showed signs of severe liver toxicity, and allegations were levelled that  women in one site of the trial had not given fully informed consent.</p>
				<p>The FTC  302 trial was being conducted in adults to document the safety and efficacy of  different combinations of anti-retroviral drugs, including a new unregistered  drug called emtricitabine. It also included the new drug nevirapine,  manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim and being tested in South Africa for use  in the prevention of vertical transmission of HIV. Some 16 sites were being  used around the country.</p>
				<p>The Medicines Control Council has been reviewing its  control of drug trials, as have various ethics committees. The number of drug  trials in South Africa have risen rapidly recently, and there seems to be  widespread consensus that the system is in urgent need of an overhaul. </p>

				<h4>Too old to teach?</h4>
				<p>
					The Bombay High Court has admitted a public interest petition filed  against the Mumbai University, challenging the continuation of service of five  Bombay Hospital doctors beyond the stipulated age of 65. It argues that private  colleges must follow UGC guidelines under which an extension would be given to  such teachers up to the age of 65 years only.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Medical Council which is one of the respondents in the case, has in its  affidavit endorsed the petitioner's contention that the continuance of the  doctors in service was in violation of the government order.
				</p>

				<p>
					The council referred to a Supreme Court order that recognised its  responsibility for the maintenance of the highest standards of medical  education and which emphasised that the recommendations of the council were  mandatory and binding on medical teaching institutions and colleges. However,  the Mumbai University has contended that 'it is explicitly clear that the  paramount concern in regard to the eligibility of teachers in private medical  colleges is confined only to their physical and mental fitness.'

				<h4>Can you test someone's  blood against their wishes?</h4>
				<p>
					Can a person be  compelled to submit to a blood test against his or her wishes,such as to  determine a child's paternity?
				</p>
				<p>
					When a woman and her daughter filed for maintenance against a man who they said  was the girl's father, the man asserted that his wife had not lived with him  for years, asked the court to direct mother and daughter to take blood tests to  determine the child's paternity. When the trial court asked the women have the  paternity tests done by the district surgeon, failing which adverse inferences  would be drawn, the petitioners approached the High Court, which held: 'To  compel a person to undergo or to submit himself or herself to medical  examination of his or her blood test or the like without his or her consent or  against his or her wishes tantamount to interference with his or her  fundamental rights to life and liberty'. The High Court has held that no woman,  or as a matter of fact, no person can be compelled to undergo any medical test  against his or her wishes.

				<h4>Stolen kidney</h4>

					The National Human Rights Commission has asked the UP government to  institute a CBI inquiry into the forcible extraction of a kidney from a  24-year-old rickshaw puller of Bareilly, Akram Raza Khan. If the UP government  did not do so, the NHRC would tell the CBI to take over. Akram Khan was  reportedly taken to Delhi in1998 by a senior official of the department of  post, R C Gupta, promising a job in his department. He was later admitted to a  hospital at Delhi where his kidney was removed and transplanted into the  officer's ailing wife.

				<h4>Hazards of cataract  surgery</h4>

					On March 10, 2000, seven  patients were operated on for cataract by Dr Niteen Dedhiya, consulting eye  surgeon with Lilavati hospital, Mumbai. Four of them developed complications  and lost their eyesight. The operating theatre was immediately sealed and  tested for infection, but the results were negative. However, three of the  patients were found to have E-coli infection in their eyes. The hospital  disowns all responsibility for the incident. "The bottom line is that there is  risk involved in any procedure with the best of surgeons and hospitals.

				<h4>AIDS hysteria</h4>

					NGOs in Delhi have demanded an apology from the health minister A K  Walia for conducting an AIDS Campaign targeting slum dwellers alone. "The  campaign is creating myths about slums being full of STDs to terrorise people  and isolate them," said Manoj Pande of the Himalaya Seva Sangh, an NGO linked  to the AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan. "Why shouldn't MPs who travel so much,  and party-hopping affluent Delhiites be targeted for high risk behaviour and  their potential of spreading HIV?" he asked. Jaya Srivastava of Ankur warned  against falling into a trap set by funding agencies and pharmaceutical  companies. "It is through such campaigns that these agencies decimated the poor  in Africa. First they labelled Africa as the breeding ground of AIDS... and  then by targeting their slums as high-risk areas, they wiped out all aid and  attention that should have gone for nutrition and other diseases," she said.

				<h4>Sorry, not in the rules</h4>
				<p>
					Medical experts and transport authorities are taken aback by the  Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation's refusal to clear medical bills of  nearly Rs 1 lakh, of a private rural hospital which provided emergency medical  relief to nearly 50 accident victims near Pune. The KSRTC's argument: there is  no provision under the rules to pay a private hospital.
				</p>

				<p>
					"We are not after money and are willing to treat it as charity," says Dr Shyam  Kulkarni, who heads the 25-bedded Anand hospital, Yewat, near Pune, "but we  are not sure how to react in the event of another accident." A truckload of  badly injured people were brought to the hospital after the speeding KSRTC bus  dashed against a lorry carrying iron angles. Hospital staff were overwhelmed by  the magnitude of the mishap, providing intravenous drips, Xrays, minor  surgeries, and treatment for fractures and other injuries. One passenger died  in the hospital, nine were seriously injured, 20 had multiple fractures and 20  suffered other injuries.

				<h4>Supervising IVF</h4>
				<p>
					A committee on Labor, Social Affairs and Health in Israel called on the  Health Ministry to boost supervision of fertility treatments in private  clinics, and to consider liberalising regulations to expand the pool of egg  donors beyond women receiving fertility treatment.
				</p>

				<p>
					This follows accusations about irregularities in fertility treatment regarding  egg donations. A 32-year-old woman is suing the Herzliya Medical Center after  two gynaecologists used "the plaintiff's reproductive organs as a machine for  producing ova" without her consent, which were then "sold to other women".  Other women came forward claiming that more eggs than they had consented to  provide had been extracted for commercial gain. All the doctors implicated in  the lawsuit deny the allegations. An estimated 15,000 women have fertility  treatment in Israel at nearly two dozen (most privately run) IVF centres. About  2,000 women await donated ova, mostly from private clinics which offer almost-free fertility treatment in return for egg donation.

				<h4>Testing embryos</h4>
				<p>
				The German minister of health invited reproductive scientists,  philosophers, theologians, and lawyers to a public hearing on proposed new  legislation on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which is currently not  legal in Germany. It would allow PGD but restrict it to cases where there is a  known predisposition for severe genetic disease.</p>
				<p>Though constitutional  modifications in 1994 made it possible to regulate reproductive medicine at the  federal level, the recent public hearing made it clear that opinion on the  topic remains sharply divided, with little scope for compromise. Whereas  representatives of medical associations demanded the right to use PGD,  organisations representing people with disabilities disagreed. Similarly,  researchers want a relaxation of existing laws on stem-cell research, to  enable collaboration with the international research community, but politicians  feared it would be misused. </p>

				<p>The head of the Health Department said that his  department "was not aware of these deaths". The president of COMB said the  ethics committee had not received any formal complaint but added: "if these  statements are true, then an urgent solution has to be found". The next day,  the Board of Independent Doctors at another of the city's university hospitals  released a statement saying that six patients on the heart-surgery waiting  list died in the last semester.

				<h4>Health database</h4>

					Following a joint  seminar with the World Health Organization, the World Medical Association is to  draw up international guidelines on the use of centralised health databases.

					Advances in genetics and the formation of the Icelandic genetic database have  sharpened focus on the potential for abuse of all health databases, although  centralised health databases have been an essential resource for scientific  research for many years.

				<p>
					"Guidelines must address the issues of informed consent, privacy, confidentiality,  individual access, and accountability on the part of the owner of the  database," said Dr Anders Milton, chairman of the World Medical Association.
				</p>

				<p>
					Among the issues to be tackled: whether separate guidelines are needed for  genetic and other health data, and the role of the private sector.
				</p>

				<p>
					Dr Daniel Wikler, senior ethicist at the World Health Organization, cautioned  that developing countries must receive particular attention because they are  targets for research initiatives even though the level of public awareness and  education may be low.

				In the UK, a court of appeal overturned a ruling sanctioning a  hysterectomy on a 29-year-old learning disabled woman whose mother had asked  for the operation to stop her daughter's periods and prevent her from getting  pregnant.</p>
				<p>The ruling held that the high court had wrongly agreed that the  mother could choose equally between a laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy and  the insertion of a Mirena coil. The former is drastic surgery, whereas the less  invasive procedure, the Mirena coil, which reduces menstrual flow, was clearly  in the woman's best interests. The hysterectomy was acceptable only if the  Mirena coil failed. </p>

				<h4>These doctors may advertise</h4>

					The Israeli parliament passed a bill reversing the absolute ban on  physicians and other professionals advertising in anything but the telephone  book.

				<p>
					Although the Israeli Medical Association does not oppose doctors advertising,  the secretary-general of the IMA legal department expressed concern that  "advertising should be limited so it would not be harmful nor misleading". The  IMA is working with the Justice Ministry on specific detailed guidelines and  monitoring procedures to enforce the law and protect the public.

					The German Medical Association has relaxed its ban on public advertising for  physicians. Doctors may now publicise their specialist formal education and  specific diagnostic and therapeutic abilities on their practice signs, in  newspapers, and on the Internet. The association's delegates argued that  patients can exercise their right to choose their own doctor and their right to  self-determination in medical treatment only when they have the necessary  information, but also noted that patients should, on the other hand, be  protected against incorrect medical advertisements.
