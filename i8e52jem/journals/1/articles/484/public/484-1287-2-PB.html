				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The National Drug Policy (NDP), 1982, of Bangladesh was expected to make available essential, good quality drugs at affordable prices. This article gives an overview of the situation today, more than two decades after the Drugs (Control) Ordinance, 1982, was promulgated to implement the NDP. While there have been some successes, many of the goals of this initiative are yet to be achieved. Inadequate supply of essential drugs, substandard quality, uncontrolled drug prices and inappropriate uses of drugs are major problems in Bangladesh.

					Unethical drug promotion and marketing of substandard and unnecessary drugs in Bangladesh were very common before 1982. Instead of producing essential drugs, most drug manufacturers manufactured non-essentials such as vitamins, tonics, enzymes, gripe waters and cough mixtures. To stop these practices, Bangladesh formulated a pioneering National Drug Policy (NDP) in 1982 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmed M. Effects of regulation on pharmaceutical market in Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.pharmadu.net/articlesdetail.php?art=2&pg=1" id="1">(1)</a>. The Drugs (Control) Ordinance, 1982, was promulgated subsequently to implement the NDP <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Directorate of Drugs Administration (DDA), Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 29] Available from http://www.ddabd.org/" id="2">(2)</a>. The principal objectives of the NDP were to make available essential drugs; ensure good quality drugs; control drug prices; ensure rational use of drugs; develop an effective drug monitoring system; improve the standard of hospital and retail pharmacies; and ensure good manufacturing practices <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmed M. Effects of regulation on pharmaceutical market in Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.pharmadu.net/articlesdetail.php?art=2&pg=1" id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Directorate of Drugs Administration (DDA), Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 29] Available from http://www.ddabd.org/" id="2"> 2)</a>. Before the NDP, eight multinational companies (out of 166 licensed companies) had about 75 to 80 per cent share of the drug market. Many of them abandoned their operations in Bangladesh after the NDP. Today, local pharmaceutical companies dominate the drug market with a share of more than 75 per cent <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmed M. Effects of regulation on pharmaceutical market in Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.pharmadu.net/articlesdetail.php?art=2&pg=1" id="1">(1)</a>. The NDP has had some success in regulating the drugs market of Bangladesh, but many of the goals of this initiative are yet to be achieved.

				<h4>Access to essential drugs</h4>
				<p>
					Although official documents indicate that 80 per cent of the population has access to affordable essential drugs <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of Bangladesh and United Nations (UN) Country Team. Millennium development goal (MDG) progress report 2005. [cited 2007 Apr 29] Available from http://www.un-bd.org/undp/mdgs/Bangladesh%20MDG%20Progress%20Report%202005.pdf" id="3">(3)</a>, there is plenty of evidence of a scarcity of essential drugs in government healthcare facilities. One study conducted in four district hospitals and one medical college hospital showed that only eight per cent of patients received the prescribed medicines from these facilities <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Omer K, Cockcroft A. Bangladesh hospital improvement initiative: follow-up community based users' survey (final report). CIETeurope; 2003. [cited 2006 Apr 30] Available from http://www.ciet.org/en/documents/projects_library_docs/200622410625.pdf" id="4">(4)</a> In another report, two major hospitals in the capital city of Dhaka were operating without essential medicines for eight consecutive weeks <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Oxfam.

[cited 2006 Apr 30] Available from http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/health/downloads/bangladesh.pdf" id="5">(5)</a>. There are countless such incidents relating to the supply of essential medicines in Bangladesh. In most such cases, government officials and health professionals are responsible for the shortage as they often sell government-supplied drugs to local drug stores instead of dispensing them to poor patients <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Islam MS. A review on the policy and practices of therapeutic drug uses in Bangladesh. Calicut Med J 2006; 4(4): e2" id="6">(6)</a>. The government must be cognisant of this fact, but rarely takes any action.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Quality of available drugs</h4>
				<p>
					Of the 300 pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh, only the 20 to 25 top ones produce drugs of standard quality <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Islam MS. A review on the policy and practices of therapeutic drug uses in Bangladesh. Calicut Med J 2006; 4(4): e2" id="6">(6)</a>. Reports show that numerous small companies market substandard drugs in the country <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roy J. The menace of substandard drugs. World Health Forum 1994; 15(4): 406-7" id="7">(7)</a>. Fake or substandard medicines, including life saving ones, with an estimated worth of US$ 150 million per year, are flooding the domestic market <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Smith G. What FIP and WHO are doing to fight the problem of counterfeit drugs? Pharm J 2004; 273: 394-6" id="8">(8)</a>. In its annual testing in 2004, the government laboratory detected 300 counterfeit or very poor quality drugs out of 5,000 drug samples. A recent assay involving 15 brands of ciprofloxacin showed that 47 per cent of samples contained less than the specified amounts of the active ingredient <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Islam MS. A review on the policy and practices of therapeutic drug uses in Bangladesh. Calicut Med J 2006; 4(4): e2" id="6">(6)</a>. Another report noted that 69 per cent of paracetamol tablets and 80 per cent of ampicillin capsules produced by small companies were of substandard quality <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Primo-Carpenter J. A review of drug quality in Asia with focus on anti-infectives. United States Pharmacopeia-Drug Quality and Information Program.

				</p>
				<p>
					Good manufacturing practice (GMP) is a major criterion to maintain standard quality in drugs, and it was one of the principal objectives of the NDP to ensure standard manufacturing practices for drug manufacturers. But there are some 265 pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh that do not follow or comply with GMP <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bangla2000.com. Most of 265 pharmaceutical cos do not follow GMP. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.bangla2000.com/news/Archive/Business/2001-02-22/news_detail2.shtm" id="10">(10)</a>. It is widely alleged that adulteration flourishes in the country because of poor government vigilance and supervision over drug manufacturers and sellers. Unfortunately, a section of corrupt physicians and government officials is involved in these underhand dealings. The government states that it has limited manpower and facilities to cope with the country's fast expanding pharmaceuticals sector <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Spurious medicines. New Nation [Editorial] 2006 Sep 24. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_31014.shtml" id="11">(11)</a>. In fact, the regulatory authories have given scant attention to quality matters in Bangladesh.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Lack of control over drug prices</h4>
				<p>
					In Bangladesh the maximum retail price (MRP) of every essential drug is fixed by the Directorate of Drug Administration (DDA); for all other drugs the DDA endorses the companies' quoted prices <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Directorate of Drugs Administration (DDA), Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 29] Available from http://www.ddabd.org/" id="2">(2)</a>. Drug prices are quite high in Bangladesh in comparison to neighbouring countries. The drugs control authority is apparently reluctant to negotiate with the companies to fix prices <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pinaki Roy. Essential drugs turn costlier. Daily Star 2005 Oct 13; 5(492): 1" id="12">(12)</a>. The regulatory authorities have virtually no control over drug prices in Bangladesh. Indiscriminate pricing can be observed in all therapeutic classes of drugs. For example, prices of various ciprofloxacin brands range from Taka (Tk) 5 to 14 (US$ 0.07 to 0.20) per unit <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chowdhury FR Ahasan HA, Rahaman MM. National drug policy of Bangladesh: some pitfalls in implementation. J Coll Physicians Surg Pak 2006; 16(5): 368-70" id="13">(13)</a>. The price of dexamethasone eyedrops extends from Tk 24 to 90 (US$ 0.34 to1.29) per 5ml, and diclofenac eye drops are available at a price range from Tk 40 to 200 (US$ 0.57 to 2.86) per unit <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Islam MS. A review on the policy and practices of therapeutic drug uses in Bangladesh. Calicut Med J 2006; 4(4): e2" id="6">(6)</a>. These are a few of the existing price discrepancies in the country.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Patterns of drug use</h4>
				<p>
					To ensure rational and appropriate use of drugs in Bangladesh was another prime concern of the NDP. But there has been no drug use study in the country <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chowdhury AKA. Bangladesh core group report. INRUD (International Network for Rational Use of Drugs) News 2005; 15(1): 7-8" id="14">(14)</a>. Clinically inappropriate and inefficient use of medicines is a serious problem. More than half the medicines in Bangladesh are inappropriately prescribed, dispensed or sold <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chowdhury FR, Rahman MM, Huq MF, Begum S. Rationality of drug uses: its Bangladeshi perspectives. Mymensingh Med J 2006; 15(2): 215-9" id="1">(15)</a>. Despite legal prohibitions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmed M. Effects of regulation on pharmaceutical market in Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.pharmadu.net/articlesdetail.php?art=2&pg=1" id="1">(1)</a>, numerous drugs with similar or no significant benefits are available in the market. As a specific example, there are seven members of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors available in the country. The efficacies and chemical structures of these molecules are more or less similar, but their price vary significantly <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chowdhury FR Ahasan HA, Rahaman MM. National drug policy of Bangladesh: some pitfalls in implementation. J Coll Physicians Surg Pak 2006; 16(5): 368-70" id="13">(13)</a>. The drug policy clearly prohibits the production of multi-ingredient preparations of vitamins and minerals with the exception of B-complex vitamins <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ahmed M. Effects of regulation on pharmaceutical market in Bangladesh. [cited 2007 Apr 30] Available from http://www.pharmadu.net/articlesdetail.php?art=2&pg=1" id="1">(1)</a>. But a mixture of 32 vitamins and minerals including selenium, vanadium, molybdenum, tin and many other unnecessary ingredients has been marketed in the country for a few years, violating the principles of the NDP. The need for these trace elements in Bangladesh is not established whereas nutritional deficiencies are mainly related to vitamins A and B-complex, iron, calcium, iodine and zinc <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chowdhury FR Ahasan HA, Rahaman MM. National drug policy of Bangladesh: some pitfalls in implementation. J Coll Physicians Surg Pak 2006; 16(5): 368-70" id="13">(13)</a>. Irrational prescription and use of antibiotics are rampant throughout the country, with an estimated half of all antibiotics being sold without prescriptions <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Guyon AB et al.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Inadequate supply of essential drugs, substandard quality, uncontrolled drug prices and inappropriate uses of drugs are major problems in Bangladesh. The drugs control authorities should be better equipped and more vigilant to cope with the situation. Health professionals and drug manufacturers should be more committed in order to achieve the goals of the NDP.
