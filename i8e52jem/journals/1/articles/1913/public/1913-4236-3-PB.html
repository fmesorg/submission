				<h4>A physician's prayer</h4>
				<p>
					Oh God, Most High, before I commence my work, holy in nature, to treat thy creatures, I entreat Thy Holy Seat to grant me spiritual courage and plenty of energy to perform my duties fathfully; and if, in my ambition, I strive for wealth or good things, do not blind my eyes from seeing correctly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Help me to look at each sufferer who approaches to ask my advice as a man of note, without distinction between rich and poor, friend or enemy, good or bad (but just) as a man in distress. Let him appear to me only as a man.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please, O Merciful and Compassionate God, grant me strength and courage both in body and soul and implant in me a perfect spirit.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>(Translated by Dr. Samuel J. Aptekar.)</em>
