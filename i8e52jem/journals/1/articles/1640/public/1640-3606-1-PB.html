					<em><strong>Did your medical education include any discussion of medical ethics?</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					NO.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><strong>How much time do you estimate was spent in any discussion of ethics, in all your years of medical school ?</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					NIL.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><strong>Please describe a situation in medical school in which you had to make a decision which was not based on medical knowledge alone. What were the principles you used to resolve it ?</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Don't remember any instance.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><strong>Have you even been disturbed by the practices by your seniors and teachers, their behaviour with patients and their relatives? Were you able to discuss your discomfiture with them?</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes. Several times. Most involved not behaving politely with patients. I have never addressed this issue with my seniors directly . I have heard of several unfair practices by my contemporaries and teachers regarding medical education. Though I am reasonably certain that these are true, in the absence of hard proof I have never raised these issues with the concerned persons.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em><strong>The fact that students entering capitation fee colleges make a huge capital investment that must be recovered as soon as possible after graduation is said to be behind many medical malpractices. Do you agree?</strong></em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps. But, as things stand today, there seems to be no need for such reasons to be present for both medical teachers and medical practitioners to indulge in malpractice.
