					<em>Phir  Milenge</em> (We'll meet again), the maiden directorial venture of south Indian  actress Revathy, is a poignant story of HIV-infected persons. The story  revolves around three themes&mdash;a human interest narrative, presentation of  medical facts on HIV/AIDS, and an analysis of the social and legal impact of  HIV infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tamanna (Shilpa Shetty) is a highly successful creative director of an  advertising agency. Her popularity among her colleagues and boss Subramaniam is  legendary. She wins many awards, and is rewarded and acclaimed by her agency.  Then she meets her friend Rohit (Salman Khan) from art school and has  unprotected sex with him. Rohit leaves for the US where he works. A few months  later, during a routine check-up while donating blood for her injured sister,  she discovers that she is HIV positive.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tamanna  goes into a state of shock and confusion. She tells her sister about her HIV  status. During this period, she is unable to work with her usual zeal and  commitment. Her boss is shocked to know that she is HIV positive and dismisses  her. The rest of the movie revolves around the legal implications of  HIV-infected persons and their discrimination in the workplace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tarun  (Abhishek Bachchan), a young lawyer, agrees to represent Tamanna in court  against her employer. Though there is a national policy against discrimination  of people with HIV/AIDS, the law itself is ambiguous. Subramaniam's lawyer  Kalyani (Mita Vashisht) uses every trick in the book to prove that Tamanna's  dismissal was not on the grounds that she was HIV positive. Kalyani's  cross-examination of Tamanna about her sexual activity makes the audience  squirm. Tamanna loses the case in the sessions court.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meantime, Rohit returns to India, terminally ill. An angry Tamanna  confronts him only to learn that he was unaware of his HIV status during their  encounter. She forgives him and cares for him till he dies. Tarun pursues the  case in the High Court. Tamanna continues to work and wins many awards.
				</p>
				<p>
					This film is well researched. The director has worked with experts from  medical, legal and social agencies working on HIV/AIDS to produce a near  flawless film. The messages are delivered with subtlety. Thus, viewers learn  that unprotected sex causes the spread of HIV. Routine contact is shown to be  safe; scenes of Tamanna's sister hugging her, and drinking water out of the  same container, leave a lasting impression.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tamanna brings out the helplessness and angst of a discriminated employee. The  dichotomy between the policy and law on HIV in the workplace is highlighted in  different stages of the trial. Dubious practices in the judicial system are  authentically portrayed by Kalyani. Excellent performances by Shilpa Shetty,  Abhishek Bachchan and Salman Khan make this movie emotionally charged.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are, however, some drawbacks. Counselling and treatment are dealt with in a  very sketchy manner. Revathy, who plays the doctor, could have spent time  explaining and supporting Tamanna, but she seemed to be in a hurry to get back  to directing. The role of NGOs, especially in counselling, is not shown.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second,  while the movie highlights some ways in which HIV affects society, Tamanna's  only battle seems to be against her employer. Her social acceptance, as  portrayed in this film, is too good to be true. Most people with HIV infection  face considerable social stigma, but this subject has been handled very  superficially. Tarun's long speech during the High Court proceedings is  theatrical and out of character. Finally, the central issue of discrimination  in the workplace could have been analysed in depth.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  conclusion, the making of this movie is a brave attempt to highlight some  issues facing people with HIV. To film such a story without an eye on the box  office is a tribute to the social commitment of the makers of this film.
