				<h4>Patients' rights</h4>
				<p>
					A recent visit to the United States included visits to dentists, general  medical practitioners, consultants and university hospitals. Three things  impressed me vis-&agrave;-vis the rights of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most doctors have displayed their consultation charges in the waiting room or  at the receptionist's desk. Second, all hospitals have information on patients' rights displayed clearly in wards, waiting areas and lobbies. These rights  include the right to refuse treatment, to a second opinion and to privacy. It is clear that patients are informed of their rights before treatment or  surgery. Third, HIV, HBsAg and HCV tests are not done on patients. It is felt  that if the patient's immune status should be declared, so should the  surgeon's, because either can infect the other.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am writing this particularly to highlight the controversy raised in India  over the display of medical fees, and on the compulsory testing for HIV status,  something that all of us do preoperatively.
