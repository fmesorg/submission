					Continuing medical  education (CME) is a way by which health professionals learn after the formal  completion of their training. This is essential in all healthcare systems,  whether in developed or developing countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					CME extends beyond  keeping up-to-date with one's own special interests, into other aspects of  continuing professional development, including computer literacy, medical  ethics, management, and evidence-based medicine. The long-term goal of CME is  to facilitate change in clinical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					A CME programme must be  developed keeping two factors in mind: needs assessment and outcome evaluation.  There should be a systematic study of needs and an identification of  priorities, taking account of the perspectives of both users and providers of  health services-not merely the needs of doctors. At the other end of the  educational process, providers of CME need to be rigorous in their evaluation  of the effectiveness of their programmes to provide a convincing answer to the  question: do these programmes make a difference to patient care and health  outcomes? Medical education must be accountable to those who pay for and use  the health services.

				<h4>CME: a global perspective</h4>
				<p>
					In the USA, most  licensing authorities issue time-limited certificates to specialists, mostly  for didactic courses for a specified number of credit hours to meet  re-certification requirements. The rationale for time-limited certificates is  twofold: to encourage doctors to keep up-to-date, and to identify those doctors  who continue to meet the specialty boards standards and those who do not. In  Europe, participation in CME programmes is largely voluntary, but both the  European Union of Medical Specialists and the Standing Committee of European  Doctors have adopted charters which state that doctors have an ethical  obligation to undertake further education. The European Union of General  Practitioners, 'recognizing that moral responsibility alone is insufficient',  has suggested that doctors should be given incentives to participate in CME  activities. The most important issue in CME is the quality of the education  programmes offered, not whether they are voluntary or mandatory.

				<h4>CME in Bangladesh</h4>
				<p>
					In Bangladesh, there is  no defined and approved system for CME. The Centre for Medical Education is  doing something in this regard. To develop a system for CME in Bangladesh,  policy-makers and professional bodies and organisations must show commitment  and set a strategy. The Bangladesh Medical Association, the Centre for Medical  Education, the Pharmacy Council, the Nursing Council, the Bangladesh  (governmental and non-governmental) Health Technologists Association and other  authorities should come forward with a vision for producing competent health  professionals for the effective delivery of health services, based on our  needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Bangladesh, people's  expectations are growing. The public expects healthcare providers to meet  certain standards, and identify and remove from practice those who do not meet  such standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Bangladesh, CME programmes should be arranged for different health  professionals, for teachers of different institutes and disciplines, for  private general practitioners and also for those in rural communities. The mass  media can also play a vital role in addition to licensing authorities and  professional bodies. All health personnel should be responsible for their  lifelong learning. Ideally, there should be a formal re-certification procedure  every 7-10 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health professionals who  do not get re-certified may be paid less, may lose admission rights to  hospitals and will be less favoured by patients. Health professionals who  complete approved CME programmes may charge the state more. In this way, we can  produce competent health professionals for better healthcare delivery, who can  live up to the public's expectations.
