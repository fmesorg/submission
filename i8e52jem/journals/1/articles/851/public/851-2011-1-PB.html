					The  use of genetic screening to detect potential diseases&mdash;as well as other  characteristics&mdash;in embryos in a laboratory, in patients in a clinic, or in  applicants for life insurance. The transplantation of human organs and  tissues. The conduct of clinical trials in developing countries,  including the special problems that arise in testing treatments or vaccines for  HIV. Access to essential drugs in resource-poor settings. The procedures  for deciding which treatments are made available in a country to treat which  diseases&mdash;and which treatments will not be available and which diseases not  treated. The implicit assumptions behind quantitative measures for the  effectiveness of various uses of healthcare resources. The study of  stored tissue samples to determine the genetic bases of diseases. The cloning  of human embryos, to make babies or provide cells for research and  therapy. The potential for stem cell therapy to change the treatment of  many diseases and thereby either increase or greatly reduce the cost of treating  chronic or degenerative conditions. Increases in long-term care, the burdens of  which are often borne primarily by families (and within families, primarily by  wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law).

				<h4>Initiative  by WHO</h4>
				<p>
					These are just a few of  the topics that have become matters of concern to healthcare providers,  government officials, and the general public in recent years. For many years,  the World Health Organization (WHO) has contributed to the analysis of such  bioethical issues as they have arisen in the context of its technical work on  many topics. Recognizing that countries increasingly need advice and guidance  on the ethical aspects of healthcare, public health, research with human beings  and biotechnology, the Director-General launched an Ethics and Health  Initiative by establishing a new unit within her office in October 2002.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The  Ethics and Health Unit</h4>
				<p>
					The Ethics and Health  Unit (DGO/ETH) facilitates the examination of a wide range of ethical issues  raised by activities throughout the Organization&mdash;in the Regions as well as  Geneva&mdash;and also initiates projects as needed. ETH works collaboratively  with staff from all departments and the regional offices to identify, design  and carry out studies addressing the ethics of healthcare, public health and  biomedical science. This encompasses projects that originate in the unit and  those on which it provides advice and assistance to activities located in other  clusters and in regional offices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The specific projects,  many of which link different departments and involve experts from outside the  organisation, will evolve in response to changes in the field as perceived by  member states, regional offices, headquarters staff, and the academic world.  The Unit's initial efforts are concentrated in four areas, beginning with WHO's  central concern for the functioning of health systems. Health has been  identified as a major precondition for economic development <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Commission on Macroeconomics and Health. Macroeconomics and health: investing in health for economic de-velopment (Report). Geneva: WHO, 2001." id="1">(1)</a>. Questions of  access not only to essential healthcare, but also to the benefits of new  technologies are in urgent need of further scrutiny from an ethical as well as  technical viewpoint. Other issues, such as those that arise from the increasing  reliance on long term care <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO Cross-Cluster Initiative on Long-term Care. Ethic-al choices in long-term care: what does justice require? Geneva: WHO, 2002." id="2">(2)</a>, need to be tackled by industrialised and  developing countries alike, with special attention to the implications for  individual, familial and societal responsibilities for care generally.  Finding common&mdash;and just&mdash;standards will be a major theoretical as well as  practical challenge <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Macklin R. Against relativism. Cultural diversity and the research for ethical universals in medicine. New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press,1999." id="3">(3)</a>. The topics already receiving attention are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						the value assumptions embedded in using clinical and       outcomes data to rationalize and prioritise healthcare services;
					</li>
					<li>
						the ethical consequences of increasing economic       globalisation for health and healthcare; and
					</li>
					<li>
						the intersections between ethics and human rights in       the context of public health.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Second, many parts of  WHO are involved with the practical, scientific and ethical issues in human  genetics and genomics, as was apparent from the release of <em>Genomics and World  Health</em> by WHO's Advisory Committee on Health Research <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Advisory Committee on Health Research. Genomics and world health. Geneva: WHO, 2002." id="4">(4)</a>. Among the topics on  which the ETH team is working with other WHO and UN units are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						privacy and confidentiality issues raised by the       development and use of genetic databases and of 'banks' of human biological       specimens generally;
					</li>
					<li>
						issues for drug companies, researchers and patients       from the application of genetics to pharmaceutical testing and       licensing;
					</li>
					<li>
						the range of practical and theoretical issues in the       patenting of human genes; and
					</li>
					<li>
						the ethical aspects of genetic screening, testing, and       counselling (a subject on which WHO has previously issued guidelines) <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="UNESCO. Universal declaration on the human genome and human rights. Paris: UNESCO, 1997." id="5">(5</a>, <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association (WMA).

				</ul>

				<h4>Ethics  and research</h4>
				<p>
					Both because of its  obligations to member states to help them in building up their research  capacity and because many WHO projects involve research with human beings which  must be conducted according to the highest ethical standards, the Organization  has been engaged for some time in a number of activities in this field.  These have ranged from running workshops for committees that review the ethics  of research to promulgating guidelines and standards. ETH is working not  only to coordinate these activities, both within WHO and with other outside  efforts such as those of the Council for International Organizations of Medical  Sciences (CIOMS) <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organizations of Medical Sci-ences (CIOMS). International ethical guidelines for bio-medical research involving human beings. Geneva: CIOMS, 2002." id="7">(7)</a>, but also to make sure that the information provided is  accurate and consistent. This process will have to involve a wide range of  countries if it is to deal satisfactorily with many contentious disputes, such  as those over research in developing countries especially regarding HIV AIDS <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lurie P, Wolfe SM. Unethical trials of interventions to reduce perinatal transmission of the human immuno-deficiency virus in developing countries. N Engl J Med 1997; 337:853-856." id="8">(8</a>, <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Angell M. The ethics of clinical research in the Third World. N Engl J Med 1997;337:847-849." id="9">9</a>, <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhutta ZA. Ethics in international health research: a perspective from the developing world. Bull World Health Organ 2002;80:114-120." id="10">10</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Benatar SR. The HIV/AIDS pandemic: a sign of instability in a complex global system. J Med Phil 2002;27:163-177." id="11">11</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Feinberg J, Japour AJ. Scientific and ethical considerations in trial design for investigational agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. J Clin Infect Dis 2003;36:201-206." id="12">12)</a>. In addition, the Unit is working with others in WHO on developing an  assessment tool to make research design and informed consent processes more  culturally sensitive, and is analysing standards to see when special  consideration is needed for research with populations in 'at risk' situations,  including indigenous peoples, victims of disasters and recipients of  humanitarian aid, children and pregnant women. This work should be helped by a  study of universal Vs. culturally based approaches to bioethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, a number of the  ongoing projects involve biotechnologies, from human reproduction to the safety  and ethical issues in increased international 'trade' in human organs and  tissues. Another related field being studied is the implications for health  systems of developments in human stem cell research; the emphasis here is not  on the much discussed topic of the cells' derivation but rather their potential  uses in drug and toxicology testing, in research and in treatment of a wide  range of diseases, particularly chronic or degenerative conditions such as  diabetes, Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.
				</p>

				<h4>Future  directions</h4>
				<p>
					Besides forging linkages  among activities in Geneva and the regional offices of WHO, ETH will work with  other international and regional bodies on bioethics topics, in particular  through interagency activities within the United Nations system and through its  facilitation of the Global Summit of National Bioethics Commissions. ETH has  already established a substantial web page (<a href="http://www.who.int/ethics/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/ethics/en/</a>) to  foster communication and information dissemination, especially through the  Global Bioethics Calendar. It also provides education for WHO staff on the  ethical aspects of their work, organises lectures, and provides an opportunity  for junior and senior visiting fellows to join the unit temporarily. Staff at  Headquarters whose programmatic responsibilities intersect with topics in bioethics  meet monthly as the Ethics Council. This group addresses the full range of  bioethics topics identified as relevant to the Organization's work; particular  issues requiring greater inter-cluster attention or formal decisions are then  addressed by ad hoc working groups. ETH hopes to develop working relationships  with ethics centres around the world, as needed to carry out its  responsibilities. Eventually, this should lead to the formation of a network of  WHO collaborating centres in bioethics (units within academic or research  institutions which cooperate with specified technical programmes according to  mutually agreed terms of reference).
				</p>
				<p>
					While still a new part  of WHO, ETH has begun many challenging projects. It welcomes input on  these&mdash;or other, related bioethics topics&mdash;from healthcare providers and  policymakers, experts in academia, government and the private sector, and  students of healthcare ethics generally.
