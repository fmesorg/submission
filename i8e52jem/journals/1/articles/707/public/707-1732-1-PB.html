				<p>
					In the years that I have been engaged in abortion research
					- and advocacy for women's right to safe abortions -- I have
					faced difficult questions about my stand on the subject. I have
					been challenged on my views supporting abortion in general. I
					have also been asked how I can oppose sex selective abortion
					while supporting women's right to abortion. This apparent
					contradiction is further complicated by the question of whether
					a woman's right to abortion includes the right to abortion of a
					foetus with a disability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The controversies surrounding any discussion of abortion ethics
					are long-standing and with no prospect of resolution in the
					near future. For one, they refer to the competing goals, rights
					and responsibilities of more than one entity/individual. Further,
					ethical complexities have increased as medical advances in
					reproductive technologies enable 'children of choice; using
					techniques including sex selection. However, researchers' and
					activists' stands on such issues must be reasoned out if they are
					to interact with the public concerned with such debates. This is
					particularly important when one is engaged in advocacy in the
					community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus I felt the need to examine whether various seemingly
					contradictory positions could be resolved and sustained on
					ethical grounds. I tried applying the various ethical frameworks
					-deontology, utilitarianism, principlism, communitarianism and
					feminist ethics-to see which one better explains the complexity
					of the issue at hand. In this paper, I discuss the application of
					the feminist bioethics framework which I found was the best
					equipped to address the ethical complexities involved.

				<h4>The difficult question</h4>
				<p>
					Though it has been practiced by women from the beginning of
					human history, abortion to prevent unwanted births continues
					to be stigmatised. The social, cultural, religious, legal and
					political context of abortion is complex. This is complicated
					by advances in medical technology. A range of prenatal
					diagnostic technologies since the 1970s and the emergence of
					preconception and genetics-based technologies more recently
					have made it possible to know the status of the foetus in terms
					of sex or other"abnormalities" This has encouraged women and
					their families to seek selective abortions including sex-based
					ones.
				</p>
				<p>
					This paper examines three core ethical issues around
					abortion:the moral standing of the foetus which is closely
					linked with the concept of 'personhood'; the conflict of 'rights' between the woman and her foetus; and finally whether the
					h."rm, to a woman, of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to
					full term outweighs the harm of undergoing an abortion. It
					touches upon ethical issues involved in sex-selective abortions
					and abortions sought following medical diagnosis predicting
					mental or physical disabilities.

				<h4>Feminist ethics</h4>

					bioethics emphasises the principles of autonomy and justice.
					It differs in its treatment of these concepts. The concept of
					autonomy emphasises the significance of a 'relational approach'
					which views all individuals as part of a larger whole <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Donchin A. Understanding autonomy relationally: Toward a reconfiguration of bioethical principles.

					is conceptualised as 'social justice' or redistributive justice and
					presumes a fair relationship among social groups. It criticises the
					overemphasis of the philosophical conception of justice which
					ignores the oppressive systems within which distribution takes
					place <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Young I. Justice and politics of difference. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1990." id="7">(7)</a>. It also notes that philosophers have viewed justice
					only in the public realm and traditionally ignored the private
					sphere, where domestic injustice takes place <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Okin S. Justice, gender, and the family. New York: Basic Books, 1989." id="8">(8)</a>. The failure to
					acknowledge gender injustice in the family permits it to be
					perpetuated and extended. Feminist bioethics also differs from
					other bioethics frameworks in its methodological approach <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sherwin S. Feminism and bioethics In: Wolf S (ed). Feminism and bioethics: beyond reproduction. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996; pp 48-66." id="9">(9)</a>.
					It takes into account the systemic whole, whether analysing a
					single phenomenon or a general issue.The case-based approach,
					contextual analysis, a moral and political stance against social
					justice, and attention to disadvantaged groups in terms of
					power relationships- all these characterise the methodologies
					of feminist approaches to bioethics.lt uses differential analytical
					categories such as gender, age, sexual orientation, disability
					status, socio-economic status, race, culture, and ethnicity.
					Although consequences are considered morally relevant, they
					are not exclusive. It focuses on action and processes. In the
					feminist bioethics framework, persons are intrinsically valuable
					and social justice enjoys an overriding concern. Finally, feminist
					bioethics is grounded in empirical realities. Its goal is to eradicate
					all forms of oppression.

				<h4>The moral standing of the foetus</h4>
				<p>
					The concept of'personhood' is pivotal to determining the moral standing of the foetus. The manner in which this concept is
					defined influences the way in which the conflict between the
					rights of the woman and of the foetus are seen in the context
					of abortion. The key questions to define the 'personhood'
					status of the foetus are: 'what is a person?' and 'When does
					personhood begins?' The literature indicates that there is no
					consensus on criteria defining personhood; they are as difficult
					and controversial as abortion itself is. Definitions of personhood
					vary between the most stringent and the most lenient. For
					example, the criteria proposed by the philosopher Anne Warren
					include consciousness, reasoning, self-motivated activity, the
					capacity to communicate, and the presence of self-concepts
					and self-awareness. <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Warren M. On the moral and legal status of abortion. In: Beauchamp T. and Walters LE (eds.) in Contemporary issues in bioethics, California: Dickenson, 1978. pp 217-228." id="10">(10)</a>. These will not be fulfilled bye newborn.
					The most lenient, defined by theologians, refers to the "decisive
					moment of humanisation7 when the new being receives the
					genetic code' <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Noonan J. An almost absolute value in history. ln:Gorovitz S. Macklin R, Jameton A, O'Connor J, Sherwin S. (eds). Moral problems in medicine. 2"" edn. Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice-Hall. 1983, pp 303-308." id="11">(11</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ramsey P. The morality of abortion. In: Rachels J (ed) Moral problems: A collection of philosophical essays. eds.., 2nd ed., New York: Harper and Row,197S,pp 37-58." id="12">12)</a>. Between these two extremes lies a range
					of other criteria. Some are based on traditional beliefs, such as
					the point of 'quickening' and 'ensoulment Others are the result
					of scientific development, such as 'viability' and the presence
					of 'electroencephalographic' (brainwave) activity <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Brody B. On the humanity of the fetus In: Beauchamp T, Walters LE (eds). Contemporary issues in bioethics, eds., California: Dickenson, 1 978; pp 229-240." id="13">(13)</a>. Other
					approaches emerged from the 'developmental view' of prenatal
					life <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cahil L. Defining personhood: A dialogue. Conscience 13 (spring), 1 992; pp 19-28." id="14">(14)</a> and from the 'potential for developing into adult
					human being' - both views marking the point of conception
					as the beginning of personhood. However, there never has
					been consensus on these criteria. I suggest that this is primarily
					because those involved in the debate arrive at the definition of
					personhood based on their values about abortion -their moral
					judgement on the woman who undergoes an abortion, or its
					association with a particular religion and so on. Thus, though the
					definition of personhood is pivotal to the discourse of abortion
					ethics, it remains unresolved.
				</p>
				<p>
					Feminists consider personhood a social category, not an isolated
					state. To be a morally significant category, personhood must
					involve personality as well as biological integrity <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petchesky R. Abortion and woman's choice: The state, sexuality, and reproductive freedom. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1985." id="15">(15)</a>. It relies
					much on the concept of the 'second person' defined by Annette
					Baier <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baier A. Postures of the mind.- Essays on Mind and Morals. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1985." id="16">(16)</a>. This emphasises the social dimension fundamental to
					any moral notion of personhood. Persons are thus members of a
					social community which shapes them; personhood is a relational
					concept defined in terms of interactions and relationships with
					others. From this perspective, foetuses have limited relationships
					in which they can participate and can make only the most
					restricted contributions. They cannot form relationships freely
					with others and <em>vice versa.</em> The foetus' primary relationship is
					with the woman who carries it in her womb. All relationships are
					mediated through her. The relationship between the foetus and
					the woman carrying it is asymmetrical; it is completely dependent
					on the woman whereas she can live without it. For this reason,
					feminist bioethics reasons, the responsibility of determining the
					value of the foetus must rest with the woman.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>A conflict of rights</h4>
				<p>
					The feminist ethics framework views the situation of the
					pregnant woman considering abortion as part of a social system.
					A central moral feature of the argument Is that pregnancies take
					place within women's bodies and have profound effects on t heir
					lives <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tong R. Feminist approaches to bioethics: Theoretical reflections and practical applications. USA: Westview Press, 1997." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Willis E. Putting women back onto the abortion debate. Village Voice, July 16, 1985;pp1S." id="17">17)</a>. The other central argument is grounded in women's
					status - their social and family roles and responsibilities, t heir secondary status in most spheres of activity and male-centred
					work cultures and employment policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Within this framework, it argues, women should be judge of
					whether abortion is an appropriate response to a pregnancy. It
					is inappropriate to lay down abstract rules for when a decision
					to abort or not is "right': Woman's deliberations will involve
					considerations of their commitments to the needs and interests
					of everyone concerned, including the foetus <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sherwin S. Nolongerpatient: Feministethicsand health care. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1992." id="2">(2)</a>. Women should
					be considered the full moral agents, responsible for making
					moral decisions. Women must have the freedom and the
					authority to control their reproduction, free of male dominance
					and oppressive conditions of poverty and subordination.
				</p>
				<p>
					This argument might seem to fall within the libertarian
					framework which holds individual rights sacred. However,
					it is based on an analysis of empirical realities recognising
					the 'individual in relationships' rather than the 'individual in
					isolation: It appeal is not so much to the woman's right to bodily
					integrity, privacy and pursuit of happiness. It is based on two
					fundamental principles: human beings have "the right to a fu ll
					human life and to whatever means are necessary to achieve
					this"; and "decisions should be made by those, and only by
					those, who are importantly affected by them." <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jagger A. Abortion and a woman's right to decide. In: Carol CG, Wartofsky MW, (eds). Women and Philosophy: Toward a Theory of Liberation. New York: Putnam's, 1976." id="18">(18)</a>. Since it is the
					woman who will probably be responsible for rearing the infant
					to adulthood if it is born, the decision to have or not have the
					baby must be hers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the approach to abortion must address women's
					reproductive needs to balance the systematic oppression they
					face because of gender, race, class and ethnicity. For example,
					women from poorer families are much more affected by the lack
					of access to abortion. Thus, the two reinterpreted principles -
					the notion of a 'relational' autonomy and a redistributive justice
					- and the feminist perspective of 'personhood' together justify
					women's rights to abortion from the ethics point of view.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Objections and the response</h4>
				<p>
					The four major objections to women's right to abortion are that
					it (a) violates foetuses' right to life; (b) ignores and/or encourages
					women's irresponsible indulgence in sexual relationships; (c)
					ignores the rights of fathers and other significant others; and (d)
					ignores the option that technology be developed for unwanted
					foetuses to grow outside the mother's womb (so abortion need
					not be sought; babies thus born could then be adopted) and
					unwanted children could be adopted.
				</p>
				<p>
					The response, from the feminist ethics framework, would be
					grounded In the relational aspects of human beings on the one
					hand and the systemic and contextual analytical framework
					that characterises the feminist ethics perspective as discussed
					earlier. For example, we have earlier seen that the concept of
					'personhood' from the feminist perspective does not allow
					the foetus the status of 'second person' since its mother is its
					mediator. Similarly, the feminist ethics framework highlights
					the power politics active in all spheres of life which results in
					women's lack of control over reproduction and lack of access to
					safe contraceptives. At the same time, though fathers contribute
					equally to the foetus' genetic make up and formation, in all societies women are most affected during pregnancy, delivery
					and while rearing the child - because of biology, social
					conditioning and even law. Also, the feminist ethics framework
					holds that women will take into account the interests and
					concerns of 'significant others' while arriving at a decision on
					abortion. Lastly, the options of having unwanted children grow
					outside the mother's womb, and of adopting children, are
					considered medical encroachments on women's reproductive
					autonomy. They must be resisted as they can alienate women
					from their foetuses even in other circumstances <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Donchin A. The growing feminist debate over the new reproductive technologies. Hypatia, 1 989; 4(3): 144." id="19">(19</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Overall C. Human reproduction: Principles, practices, policies. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1 993; pp 75." id="20">20)</a>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics of sex selection</h4>
				<p>
					Sex selection can be a reflection of oppressive sexism in both
					traditional as well as western societies. Those in favour of sex
					selection argue that it would enhance the quality of life for a
					child of the "wanted" sex, for the family with the desired "sex
					balance" and for women as they often can be pregnant less often.
					Finally, it would also help limit the population. Empirical data
					in various parts of the world do not support these arguments.
					Among others, Overall concludes that there appear to be no
					valid argument for sex selection on the ground of "enhanced
					quality of life" <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Overall C. Ethics and human reproduction: A feminist analysis. Boston: Allen and Unwin, 1987." id="21">(21)</a>. As for the argument that it helps limit
					population, there is no evidence to this effect- and in any case,
					at what social cost would this be done? Further, disturbances in
					the natural sex-ratio will have unknown consequences. Obvious
					imbalances in sex ratio in China and India are attributed to
					female infanticide, sex-selective abortions and a one-child perfamily
					policy <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sen A. More than 100 million women are missing. New York Review of Books, December 20, 1990; pp 61-66." id="22">(22)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the feminist bioethics' argument supporting women's
					right to abortion is extended mechanically, it could be seen
					as supporting women's right to sex-selective abortions. For
					example, it is argued that if women do not produce sons, they will
					be victimised by their families and communities. Thus, women
					should have the right to sex-selective abortion, exercising their
					right to autonomy and preventing victimisation. However, while
					individual women might escape abuse this way, it actually
					reinforces gender inequities and accepts social injustice.
					Women's right to abortion should emancipate them from sexbased
					subordination. Sex-selective practices perpetuate the
					oppressive and sexist society which promotes this practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Preconception sex-selection technologies do not require
					women to abort foetuses. With advances in medical technology,
					including the genome project, approval of sex selection
					would set a precedent to permit choosing characteristics
					unrelated to disease - eye colour, hair type and colour, height
					or something else. This positive eugenics would soon lead to
					the commodification of human beings. The other long-term
					consequence will be in terms of the increased racism and classist
					use of genetic knowledge. For example, these technologies
					will be affordable only for elites who would set the fashion for
					socially desired characteristics of human beings <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fletcher J, Kare B. Knut E tthtcal aspects of medical genetics: A proposal for guidelines in genettc counseling, prenatal diagnosis and screening.

American lou mal of Bioethics, 2001; 1( 1 ): 10-11." id="24">24)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once again, a thoughtful application of the feminist ethics
					framework, using both the principles of redistributive justice
					and a systemic analysis of the long-term consequences of sexselection
					practices, helps address the difficult ethical issues involved in sex-selective practices.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Selective abortions for disability</h4>
				<p>
					A new problem comes up when considering the right to
					abortions of a foetus with a disability. One might argue that
					the same reasoning can be applied: since women face the most
					profound impact of such children upon their birth, they should
					be the sole decision makers to either continue or terminate
					pregnancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this position potentially strengthens the "normative"
					conceptualisation of "disability" which is value-laden. It sets a
					precedent for elimination of "unfit" people. Within the feminist
					streams, there is strong opposition emerging to this position
					on these grounds. Additionally, people with disabilities are
					lobbying against such views on grounds of social justice and
					rights of the disabled.
				</p>
				<p>
					This leaves us in a quandary with grey areas and unresolved
					matters although from the point of view of the women, it still
					tends to tilt in favour of they having right to decide in this
					regard.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The feminist perspective provides a response to most objections
					to abortion,by offering a systemicanalysis,a contextual approach,
					and an acknowledgement of oppression and inequalities
					along various axes. It also enables a resolution of seemingly
					contradictory positions in favour of abortion and against sexselective
					abortion. The two major principles of principlism
					- respect for autonomy and justice - are reinterpreted, based
					on people's experiences, thus strengthening both the reasoning
					and its appeal to common people.
