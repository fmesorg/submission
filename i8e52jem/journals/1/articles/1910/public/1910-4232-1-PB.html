				<h4>On ethics (2)</h4>
				<p>
					I find the issues of MedicaZ Ethics full of thoughtprovoking ideas and information provided by experts. These issues should also be read by lay persons.

				<p>
					May I suggest that you publish this journal monthly?
				</p>
				<p>
					It is necessary for branches of the Indian Medical Association located in the various districts of each state to discuss the different topics covered in your journal. Certainly, they should subscribe to the journal. It is only when we, as members of the medical profession, introspect on these matters that we can hope for improvement.
