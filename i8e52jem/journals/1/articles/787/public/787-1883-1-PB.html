				<h4>Clinical trials: a matter of principle</h4>
				<p>
					While I wholeheartedly support the sentiments expressed
					by Dr Gulhati in his editorial <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gulhati CM. Needed: closer scrutiny of clinical trials. Indian Journal of Medical Ethics. 2004;1:4&ndash;5." id="1">(1)</a>, I have reservations about
					the data cited and the manner in which they are presented.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Gulhati cites several examples of unethical human
					research. There is not a single reference given in support
					of these 'facts'. It is possible that these data are factual;
					yet, without appropriate reference to the source, these
					examples become mere opinions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, in an academic journal, the facts should speak
					for themselves, there should be no hyperbole. There are
					many differences between the USA and India. Stating
					that '...women have been treated worse than animals in
					America' serves no purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					The examples of poor protocols for drug trials that were
					approved by the DCGI also do not cite references. One must
					assume that these are based on personal communication to
					the author and the reader has to accept these assessments at
					face value. In the last paragraph, he writes: 'No wonder
					American companies have found doctors in Vietnam as
					competent as those in India in this field'. The implication
					here is that Vietnamese doctors are inferior to Indian ones.
					This smacks of cultural chauvinism.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wish the author had given concrete suggestions for
					improving oversight in research trials and ways to
					decentralise the process so that it becomes more
					transparent and accountable.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have come to expect higher academic and literary
					standards from the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> and
					hope the editors will sustain these principles.

				<h4>The author clarifies</h4>
				<p>
					All the cases of illegal (not merely unethical) drug trials
					cited in the article have been widely reported in the highly
					circulated print and electronic media. References are
					required for scientific articles where data are being
					quoted or interpreted and not to support the occurrence
					of events or while reporting plain news. Besides, none of
					the sponsors or investigators have raised any objection
					to the factual part of these press reports.
				</p>
				<p>
					Webster's unabridged dictionary defines 'hyperbolic' as
					'exaggerating or diminishing beyond the facts or
					exceeding the truth.' Not one word in the article meets
					this definition. I may add here that several newspapers
					such as the Hindustan Times, The Indian Express and
					Business Standard have picked up large portions from
					this article to focus the nation's attention on the malady
					of illegal and unethical drug trials. They have used exactly
					the same language as I did.
				</p>
				<p>
					How can there be 'references' for poor protocols? The
					quoted protocols have been examined and reported in
					the article.
				</p>
				<p>
					Foreign sponsors have been publicly arguing that drug
					trials require 'competent investigators, efficient infrastructure
					(research hospitals with world-class
					laboratories) and multi-ethnic patients' in support of their
					reasons for selecting India as the base for clinical trials.
					The real reasons are of course different: lower costs, lax
					implementation of laws and abundant availability of poor,
					illiterate patients. My reference to Vietnam is to show
					the hollowness of the sponsors' claims. Vietnamese
					doctors may be good clinicians but they do not have the
					infrastructure for drug trials comparable to those in India.
					Besides, there is only one ethnic population. Why, then,
					are American companies conducting drug trials there?
				</p>
				<p>
					In an editorial, it is not possible to cover all aspects of
					drug trials such as improving the oversight functions. In
					any case, the Central Government is moving in the reverse
					direction: the new Schedule Y that governs trials is being
					'liberalised', so that it would be easier to conduct trials in
					future.

				<h4>Bashir Mamdani's rejoinder</h4>
				<p>
					In his response, Dr Gulhati's states that his article did not
					deal with scientific content and therefore did not need to
					give scientific references; that newspaper accounts of
					deaths in the trials were adequate proof of something
					wrong happening in the trial; that newspapers have their
					own rules and regulations for responsible reporting.
				</p>
				<p>
					I fully sympathise with Dr Gulhati's aims to bring greater
					scrutiny to research trials but I differ with him on how
					one should go about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, as a sole source of information, they are not
					and should not be equated to proof of medical malpractice.
					While a newspaper may publish Dr Gulhati's article
					without references, that would be inappropriate in an
					academic journal such as the Indian Journal of Medical
					Ethics, which must insist on appropriate scientific
					references in all articles accepted for publication. If the
					Indian Journal of Medical Ethics publishes an article
					alleging serious malpractice based exclusively on
					newspaper reports, then it would be guilty of editorial
					malpractice.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we lack in India is a credible mechanism for airing
					complaints or serious misgivings by well-intentioned
					outsiders about a particular research trial. In the USA, at
					the public hospital where I practised for 30 years, if any
					member of the public had serious doubts about a trial
					conducted in the hospital, he/she could approach a lay
					member of the hospital's Institutional Review Board (IRB).
					The details of the complaint were discussed by the IRB
					and, when indicated, an independent reviewer was
					appointed to investigate such charges. The findings were
					made public in a timely manner. I do not know if such
					mechanisms exist in India. If not, these are critically needed
					and would protect researchers from baseless charges.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research is a vital necessity for India. While we must
					protect people from unscrupulous or fraudulent research
					trials, we must not discourage research by painting most
					researchers with a tarred brush.

				<h4>Clinical trials: in the crossfire</h4>
				<p>
					Dr Gulhati has lamented about the unscrupulous methods
					adopted while conducting clinical trials and has called
					for strengthening regulatory authorities. While we
					appreciate the spirit of the article, we are sorry to note
					that Shantha Biotechnics has unnecessarily been
					mentioned in the opening paragraph. Now it is public
					knowledge that a tussle between two government
					agencies has dragged us into the controversy. Several
					articles are still appearing in Bio Spectrum, Business
					World, etc. questioning the GEAC's stand in this case.
					How can a committee, formed to monitor environmental
					issues supervise and evaluate clinical trials ?
				</p>
				<p>
					We have not passed on the buck as alleged in the article.
					As per the new guidelines, the DCGI alone is competent
					to clear clinical trials and we have approached them. If
					GEAC has not updated its records, we cannot help the
					situation. Further, the GEAC has relied too much upon a
					Bangalore-based NGO's false allegations such as trials
					being shifted to Bangalore in view of deaths, the
					volunteers not being insured, etc. Since the NGO inflated
					the number of deaths from two to eight and tried to blackmail us, we have filed a suit against them. It is
					unfortunate that Dr Gulhati did not crosscheck with us
					before writing the article.
				</p>
				<p>
					Does Dr Gulhati sincerely believe that there would not
					have been any deaths during clinical trials had we obtained
					clearance from the GEAC? In any trial, volunteers are
					chosen at different stages of the disease to test the efficacy
					and safety of the drug. It is but natural for some of them to
					succumb during the trial. In the case of r-streptokinase
					comparative double-blind trials, out of 96 patients
					administered Shankinase (our r-streptokinase) three died
					(mortality rate 3.1%) and out of the 54 administered
					Streptase (comparative drug) another three died
					(mortality rate 5.5%). The Indian Heart Journal, in its
					latest issue states that the normal range is 8%&ndash;12.5%.
					The DCGI informed GEAC that the accepted range is 6%
					(Economic Times; March 12, 2003).
				</p>
				<p>
					Shantha Biotechnics values life highly and carries the
					logo 'Inspired by life'. Our motto is to make world-class
					health care products at an affordable cost to improve the
					quality of life. Shankinase is our third product. Both our
					earlier products won prestigious DSIR and National
					Technology Awards individually. Anyone can look at our
					track record to see how we suffered while conducting
					interferon alpha trials on monkeys. We agree with Dr
					Gulhati that clinical trials have to be monitored closely
					to see that unethical practices are not allowed. But tagging
					our name along with violators is most painful and
					regrettable. We are ready to share further information
					with the author.

				<h4>The author defends</h4>
				<p>
					With regard to reference to Shantha Biotechnics, I wrote
					the following:
				</p>
				<p>
					'How many people know that eight patients in Hyderabad
					who were administered recombinant streptokinase to test
					its efficacy and safety have died? According to the Genetic
					Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), the trial was
					being conducted by the drug's manufacturer Shantha
					Biotechnics without taking clearance. Not surprisingly,
					the Company denies the allegation claiming that it had
					taken permission from the DCGI. In this game of passing
					the buck, no one is shedding any tears on the lives lost or
					compensating the families of those whose loved ones have
					died. Without any independent enquiry, the death of 'trial
					subjects', as they are impersonally called, has been
					attributed to 'causes other than the use' of the drug!'
					In his rejoinder, Mr Prasad has not disputed any point
					except the number of reported deaths. I made the following points. (1) The GEAC claimed that the trial was done
					without its permission. I also added that Shantha
					Biotechnics denies the allegation and claims that it had
					the DCGI's permission. Mr Prasad agrees with this
					statement by saying 'a tussle between two government
					agencies has dragged us into the controversy'. (2) Families
					of dead subjects have not been adequately compensated.
					Mr Prasad has not disputed this point. (3) There was no
					independent enquiry into the cause of deaths. Mr Prasad
					has not disputed this point either.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only point of dispute is the number of deaths. He
					himself agrees that a 'Bangalore-based NGO inflated the
					number of deaths from two to eight.' However in the
					next paragraph he contradicts himself by saying that total
					deaths were in fact six. His company's product-related
					deaths were three while those related to the comparative
					drug was another three. Nowhere did I say that all the
					eight deaths (six admitted by Mr Prasad) were due to
					Shantha Biotechnics' brand. The deaths took place in a
					clinical trial sponsored by Shantha Biotechnics. In any
					case, the issue is not whether eight, six or two people
					died. Even one death is too many. Mr Prasad has himself
					raised many other points, not mentioned in the article
					and attempted to answer them as well.

				<h4>Medical professionals and kidney transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					The kidney trade is regularly reported in the press. The
					most recent such report is from Mumbai where a
					nephrologist has been arrested for his involvement in a
					kidney transplant racket <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Press Trust of India. Bail for doctor in kidney transplant racket case. The Indian Express. January 30, 2004." id="2">(1)</a>. Over the years, doctors have
					been charged with pocketing crores of rupees through illegal
					transplants. In one case, a number of donors are reported to
					have died following surgery, with their bodies disposed of
					without autopsies. It is possible that some of the doctors
					blamed are innocent. It is for the law of our land to decide.
				</p>
				<p>
					Living donor transplantation is lawfully practised in India
					in the context of related renal transplantation as per The
					Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. However,
					even among relatives, instances of family pressure on
					the donor have been reported <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Acharya VN. Ethics of organ transplantation&mdash;Indian perspective. Asian Journal of Renal Sciences 2002;5:5&ndash;8." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, commerce in organ transplantation is prohibited.
					Authorisation of donation by unrelated living donors is
					permissible if found to be ethical and altruistic. This has
					often been misused. It is sad that a few doctors choose to
					participate in organ trafficking. Their involvement
					ridicules the nobility of our profession, of medical ethics
					and the rationale of self-regulation. However, there is no
					reason for the entire profession to share the collective
					blame for the misdeeds of a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					The physician has a duty to inform patients of the costs
					and benefits of any procedure. One doubts if the poor
					people who 'donated' their kidneys were informed of the
					risks of donation, or told that they would receive no health
					care for any complications following the donation.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are reports of transplantation tours by citizens of
					developed countries to obtain paid non-related living
					organ transplant from the developing countries <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Inston NG, Ready AR. The right to buy or sell a kidney. Lancet 2002;360:948&ndash;9." id="4">(3)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite legislation permitting the removal of organs from
					brain-dead persons more than 95 per cent of transplants
					in India are performed from live donors, perhaps the
					largest live programme in the world <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shah VR. Perioperative management of brain-dead organ donor. Transplantation 2002;1:44&ndash;50." id="5">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The overall silence by medical professionals and their
					associations is perturbing. If we choose not to heed the
					signals, some day harsh medical regulations may suffocate
					this profession. Doctors are entitled to a fair return on
					their investments. There are many ways this could be
					ensured even as the profession regulates itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, while we need to condemn wrong
					practices, we also need to ensure that innocent doctors are
					not maligned. This would mean a total commitment by
					Indian medical associations to regulate our matters
					ourselves.
