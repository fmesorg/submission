					The departments of  epidemiology and psychiatry, NIMHANS, have been organising a series of  workshops on 'Suicide prevention: capacity building strategies' involving  doctors, teachers, police staff, etc. to address the issue of increasing  suicide rates in Bangalore, the 'suicide capital' of India. The aim of the  workshop series was to evolve a National Suicide Prevention Strategy. As a part  of this, a workshop was organised for media professionals to examine the role  of media in the glamorisation of suicide and to evolve parameters for ethical  reporting of suicides. This report refers to some aspects relevant to the  medical profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was noted that  suicide was becoming a public health problem throughout the country. There was  a need to do research on the subject, and to translate the research into  practice. The present project was started with a seed grant from the Department  of Science and Technology, Government of Karnataka, for work with the police in  12-15 hospitals. The department had prepared two epidemiological reports on  suicide. NIMHANS had begun a helpline in Bangalore along with the  Medico-Pastoral Association and Rotary Bangalore East.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the research in  this field was from the West and would not necessarily be applicable in the  Indian context. The causes of suicides were multifactorial with a predominance  of sociocultural factors in India. Some studies from the West have suggested  that media portrayal of suicides did have an effect on the increasing suicide  rates in the country but this needs to be studied in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Suicide attempts not  only affected the individual but also the family and community. The media  needed to step in and address trends promoting suicide. The impact of cinema  was substantial and was working against efforts to prevent suicide attempts. It  was felt that the media sometimes indulged in irresponsible reporting, such as  the sensationalising of celebrity suicides.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two queries were raised.  Did the media have the power to trigger suicides in some people? Did it also  have the power to prevent suicide?
				</p>
				<p>
					It was suggested that  there were limitations in the way the media could respond appropriately to  suicide. The fact is that the press could just be a mirror of the society. The  mass media could only act as a catalyst and it was for society to change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Data by the group Mythri  from Cochin, where there was a falling trend of suicides, showed that in the  reporting of suicides, unusual methods such as suicide pacts and celebrity  suicides got prominence. However, there was under-reporting of preventable  health problems such as depression, of people who had managed to deal  positively with their suicidal thoughts, and of early identification and  prevention in those at risk. Media suicide stories with a potential 'contagion'  effect were those that paid undue emphasis on the method, were repeated  prominently, involved celebrities, and highlighted oversimplified causes and  suicides associated with a touch of glorification.
				</p>
				<p>
					There was also a need  for a commitment to tackle this problem by the medical profession. Thus a panel  discussion was moderated by Ms Shailaja Santosh and involved artists,  journalists and medical professionals. Among the main points that emerged was  that health professionals need to consider meeting journalists as an  opportunity and not a threat. Some other general principles: learn to listen to  the cry for help; learn to share when depressed; and when you encounter severe  depression, consult experts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some suggestions  included counselling training for school teachers so that they could help  during examinations; reorientation of general practitioners so that they could  identify the depressed and counsel them at the earliest; working at different  levels with formal and informal community leaders, and pre-examination  counselling for students as well as teachers/parents.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, there was a  need to strike a balance between freedom of expression, freedom of the media,  public health interest (minimising the risks) and the commercial interests that  influence media reporting and policy. The workshop concluded with the framing  of guidelines for media reporting of suicides.
