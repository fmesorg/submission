				<h4>Sensitive  article</h4>
				<p>
					This is with reference to your article on PVS <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nair K Rajashekharan. Clinical tales in neurology: a vegetative existence. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 55-57." id="1">(1)</a>.  I was touched by the entire story, but what touched me most is your reference to  nurses who care for such patients. Being a nurse myself, I appreciate the fact  that you have given thought to the caring aspects of PVS. I have often wondered  why many medical professionals admit terminally-ill patients with problems such  as multiple secondaries in the brain, or PVS, into intensive care units and  drain nurses' emotional strength. Having worked for over five years in intensive  care units, my colleagues and I have died many times over with every patient  (especially after caring for them for five days or more). A student of mine who  worked as a staff nurse once described to me her suffering when a patient who  was intubated for over seven days died in the ICU. She was quite sure that the  patient wanted to say something and was trying to communicate, but he died  without being able to do so. The death of that patient, without a loved one near  him, without being able to talk to anyone, killed a little of bit of the nurse  in her.

				<h4>Charter on medical  professionalism</h4>
				<p>
					I must congratulate the editorial team for an  extremely readable April-June 2002 issue <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The future of general practice. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10." id="2">(1)</a>, relevant to the practice of  medicine in India today.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was particularly interested in the comments of  Professor Ed Pellegrino on the Hippocratic Oath, because of a research project  by a group of physicians from America, Canada and nine countries in Europe.  Begun about three years ago, the aim of the project was to draft a charter on  medical professionalism, a document that is being hailed as a modern version of  the Hippocratic Oath.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the charter acknowledges, the modern-day doctor  is 'confronted by an explosion of technology, changing market forces, problems  in health-care delivery, bioterrorism and globalisation'. One of the drafting  physicians, retired orthopaedic surgeon and former dean of the McGill medical  school, Richard Cruess, comments that the charter is designed to say: "Look,  times are really tough, but this is what we as physicians stand for, and we're  going to try." His wife of 48 years, endocrinologist Sylvia Cruess, who also  formed part of the drafting team, says, "Professionalism had not been in any way  referred to in the medical literature, which is rather appalling, seeing that we  think we're professionals."
				</p>
				<p>
					Hence, high on the list are concerns of commitment  to integrity and honesty, reducing and reporting medical errors, avoiding  conflicts of interest with insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms and the  fair distribution of health care resources. Three fundamental principles and a  set of 10 commitments are outlined.
				</p>
				<p>
					The charter appeared in print for the first time in  the February 5, 2002, Annals of Internal Medicine and simultaneously in The  Lancet and may be viewed by logging on to the following Web address: <a href="http://annals.org/" target="_blank">http://www.annals.org/issues/v136n3/full/200202050-00012.html</a>,  under the title 'Medical Professionalism in the New Millennium: A Physician  Charter'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously, the word 'international' applies, as of  now, to the industrialised world from which the drafters come, but there is call  to 'physicians from every point on the globe to engage in dialogue about the  charter', to respond to the question: 'Does the document represent the  traditions of medicine in cultures other than those in the West, where the  authors of the charter have practiced medicine?' Some of the readers of IME may  be interested in responding from the Indian viewpoint.

				<h4>Not irrelevant  research</h4>
				<p>
					The letter from Bangalore by Dr. Sanjay Pai <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pai Sanjay. Letter from Bangalore. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 165." id="3">(1)</a> regarding research that 'cannot and should not be repeated' raised an important  and interesting point. I do agree that any research which has no benefits for  the people on which it is done should not be done. Moreover, in a broader sense,  it may be unethical to waste scarce resources on such matters. However, in his  letter, Dr Pai clubbed a study of the ICMR in the same category of research, ie  research which should not be done. This study was to measure the average length  of penis in Indian males. Dr Pai has solicited comments on his view. I disagree  with the author's views on this matter. I have not read the protocol of this  study. However, as a psychiatrist, I do feel that such a study is not  irrelevant. Such studies have been carried out in the past, and researchers have  disagreed on the results! <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Virginia Sadock. 'Normal Human Sexuality and Dysfunctions.' In : Sadock & Sadock (Editors), 7th edition, Kaplan & Sadocks Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; 1577-1608." id="4">(2)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many myths in the general population  about the size of the penis, and these myths in turn contribute to sexual  dysfunction. This research will help to dispel this myth. Moreover, it may help  manufacturers of condoms to make their product of the right size. I need not  mention the disastrous consequences, to the nation, of an ill-fitting  condom.
