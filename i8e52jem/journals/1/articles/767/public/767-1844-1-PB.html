					If the one who  decides does not pay, and the one who pays does not decide, will truth alone  have a chance? If the one who decides does not pay, and the one who pays does  not decide, and if the one who decides is 'paid', will truth stand any chance?

					This  was quoted by Dr K Weerasuriya, the WHO-SEARO representative on Essential Drugs  and Medicines, while speaking at a seminar organised by the Forum for Medical  Ethics Society (FMES) to discuss a study the society has undertaken on drug  promotion practices of pharmaceutical firms in India. I intend to explain the  purpose of the study, our impressions as we began looking at the subject, and  what we believe will be its value.

				<h4>Unresolved  conflicts of interest</h4>
				<p>
					Dr  Weerasuriya was pointing to the link between drug promotion by companies and  medical practice by health professionals. Physicians and the pharmaceutical  industry have a shared interest in advancing medical knowledge. Nevertheless,  the ethical duty of a physician is to promote a patient's best interests, while  the primary ethic of the drug industry is to promote its profitability.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is often a conflict between the interests of the patient and those of the  doctor. It is unrealistic to expect that all conflicts of interest can be  eliminated. However, certain obvious measures must be implemented if physicians  want to retain the public's trust that they still enjoy. As an organisation,  FMES works to enable medical professionals to act according to the principles  of medical ethics. These principles are: to act in the best interest of the  patient (beneficence); to protect the patient from harm (non-maleficence); to  respect the patient and foster informed choice (autonomy), and to promote  equity in health care (justice). In the context of drug promotion, FMES must  prevent the industry from placing product promotion ahead of patient welfare,  and prevent doctor from being influenced away from the patient's best  interests.

				<h4>Drug  promotion and the Indian pharmaceutical industry</h4>
				<p>
					Thousands  of Indian companies produce 70,000 brands of various drug formulations compared  to WHO's list of 250 essential drugs. Drugs are sold through chemists and  stockists who make a margin on the sale. The private sector represents 80% of  the health expenditure, so a doctor in private practice is an influential  prescriber. Allopathic drugs are prescribed by registered practitioners of all  systems of medicine, and also by unregistered practitioners. Finally, customers  who pay for the drugs are often uneducated, unaware and unable to exercise  their right to receive rationally prescribed medicines. In this unregulated  market, one can imagine the efforts made by manufacturers to promote their  drugs and make a profit.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO  defines drug promotion as 'all informational and persuasive activities by  manufacturers and distributors to induce/influence the sale and use of  medicinal drugs.' Drug promotion has an important bearing on the rational use  of drugs; on drug price-control mechanisms, the manufacture, availability and  use of essential drugs, on equity of drug distribution and the cost of health  care&mdash;all making it a central public health issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  prelude to our study, a literature search on promotional practices was  undertaken. These can be grouped under three categories: information,  incentives and trading practices.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Information</h4>
				<p>
					Doctors  in developed countries have relatively better access to objective sources of  information to offset what the industry promotes. For example, the BNF (British  National Formulary) is a noncommercial source of information available free to  all doctors in the UK. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lexchin J. Doctors and detailers: therapeutic education or pharmaceutical promotion? Int J Health Serv 1989;19: 663-79." id="1">(1)</a>. Once a doctor in India graduates from medical  school and sets up practice, there is no legal requirement of credits for  continuing medical education (CME), or for periodic re-certification. Few  doctors are interested in, and will find the time to keep themselves abreast of  the latest developments in therapeutics. The vast majority rely on drug  companies for information on new and existing products, either through mailings  or visits by their sales representatives. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Greenhalgh T. Drug prescription and self-medication in India: an exploratory study. Social Science and Medicine 1987;25: 307-18." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is much documentation on drug information given to doctors in India. Most of  the Indian articles deal with the accuracy of product information as given by  medical representatives, package inserts and advertisements in medical  journals. Drug advertisements in Indian medical journals contain less  information on safety and clinical pharmacology than their American and British  counterparts do <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lal A. Information contents of drug advertisements: an Indian experience. Ann Pharmacother 1198;32: 1234-8." id="3">(3</a>, <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lal A, Moharana AK, Srivastava S. Comparative evaluation of drug advertisements in Indian, British and American medical journals. JIMA 1997;95: 19-20." id="4">4)</a>.

				<h4>Gifts  and incentives</h4>
				<p>
					Studies  suggest that doctors hold a range of views about gifts. However, smaller gifts  and those useful in helping patients are more acceptable. Doctors readily  accept gifts that are smaller and socially more acceptable. But they have  double standards, and would frown if a politician accepted a similar gift.  There was also a sense of 'unique invulnerability', that only 'other' doctors  are influenced by gifts. This theory has been confirmed in discussions  organised by the FMES for students, practitioners and healthcare  administrators. When the audience was asked if going on a drug  company-sponsored cruise would affect their prescriptions towards the company's  product, the overwhelming majority said NO. When asked if a sponsored cruise  influenced the prescription practices of at least one doctor they knew, an  overwhelming majority would say YES.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gifts  from modest product samples to exotic cruises turn out to be a good investment  for the companies, which spend huge amount of money because they are assured of  returns. However, patients disapprove of gifts other than samples.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Trading  practices</h4>
				<p>
					Very  little published literature outside the lay press exists on this topic,  although details of trading practices are well-known in drug-trading circles.  Most members of the FMES are practising doctors, and experience from clinical  practice suggests that drug promotion is more than shaping information or  influencing doctors with gifts and incentives. We wanted to look at trading  practices which were unique to the Indian marketplace and the Indian consumer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Internationally,  it is well known that pharmaceutical firms have aggressive promotional tactics,  but such practices have not been documented within the Indian subcontinent,  either from the point of view of the strategies or the ethics of drug  promotion. For example, people often get medications directly from chemists and  retailers, bypassing doctors altogether, and drug companies exploit this link.  The initial findings of the study seem to suggest that the doctor's  prescription is not so powerful, after all, in the Indian drug market. By  interviewing a variety of stakeholders, from doctors to medical representatives  to chemists and manufacturers, we hope to identify major unethical promotional  practices, take note of significant trends, and open up the field for further  exploration, pointing to areas of concern and interest. Understanding the  dynamics of the Indian drug bazaar is the first step towards regulation,  ethical drug promotion and ethical medical practice.
