					The reported harassment of a medical student by his
					teachers has sparked off a heated debate in Kerala. The
					student, the son of a former state legislator, committed
					suicide, apparently after teachers intentionally failed him
					in the final examination <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Editorial in the Malayalam news magazine Chithragiri, July 7, 2003." id="1">(1)</a>. Following extensive press
					coverage, the state government referred the matter to the
					Petitions Committee of the Kerala Legislative Assembly.
					The Committee, which is chaired by a senior legislator
					and has eight other legislators as members, concluded
					that the student's suicide was a result of intentional harassment
					by teachers <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="News item in the Malayalam news magazine Chithragiri, July 7, 2003." id="2">(2)</a>. It named the responsible teachers
					and recommended punitive action against them.

				<h4>'Some amount of rough behaviour' is justified</h4>
				<p>
					The Kerala Government Medical College Teachers' Association
					immediately refuted the Committee's findings
					and demanded that the government ignore its recommendations.
					It stated that there was no harassment but
					that 'some amount of rough behaviour from the teachers'
					is inevitable to equip students 'to face future threats from
					patients and the public' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="News item in the Malayalam daily Desabhimani, June 27, 2003." id="3">(3)</a>.

					Medical college teachers are expected to impart the highest
					levels of academic excellence. They must also provide
					mental and emotional support to students. This responsibility
					is all the more important when they are dealing
					with students who may be physically or emotionally
					disturbed. Medical students must cope with heavy academic
					requirements, time pressures and stress related to
					clinical work. In this situation, medical college teachers
					must play the dual role of physician and teacher. Such
					support was almost always forthcoming in the past.

				<h4>A crisis in medical education in Kerala</h4>
				<p>
					Today, however, there is a crisis in medical education.
					This assumes greater significance in a state where governments&mdash;
					irrespective of their political leanings&mdash;have
					always given priority to health. Over the years, the private
					health care sector has grown without regulation,
					and medical care is becoming big business. As of March
					2000, the state had only six medical colleges, with five
					in the public sector and one in the cooperative sector,
					with a total of 800 students for the MBBS course <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of Kerala: Economic Review 2000; Kerala State Planning Board, Thiruvananthapuram; 2002." id="4">(4)</a>. By
					March 2003, five more medical colleges&mdash;four in the private sector and 1 in the cooperative sector&mdash;were
					started, adding another 500 MBBS seats <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of Kerala: Economic Review 2002; Kerala State Planning Board, Thiruvananthapuram; 2003." id="5">(5)</a>. At least three
					other institutions are waiting for approval to start medical
					courses. Investors in these colleges use every means
					to maximise profit and consolidate their position once
					they get approval to start medical courses, and the government
					has so far been unable to control the admission
					policy and fee structure in these private colleges. The
					matter is now being considered by the apex court and the
					state is planning legislation to exercise control over these
					colleges.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some professional organisations are also reported to have
					protected members who are unethical in their professional
					conduct. Such allegations were made regarding
					the recent reports of kidney sales in Kerala and the involvement
					of some private hospitals. The report of the
					Ethics Committee of the Indian Medical Association
					(IMA), Kerala state branch, was reportedly modified to
					protect IMA members&mdash;a charge refuted by the IMA.

				<h4>Medical college teachers: a powerful lobby</h4>
				<p>
					In Kerala, government doctors, including medical college
					teachers, are permitted to do private practice. Recently,
					salaries and perks of medical college teachers were
					revised with the intention of banning private practice.
					However, the government was pressurised and state government
					doctors managed to retain the right to private
					practice while enjoying revised salaries and perks almost
					at par with their central government counterparts. Both
					the bureaucracy and political leaders keep their hands
					off medical college teachers because they often rely on
					them for the treatment of their medical problems. These
					doctors manage to stay close to the centres of power and
					retain their benefits and favours.
				</p>
				<p>
					This has a high cost. Most teachers in clinical specialties
					who have reasonably good private practices, hardly find
					time to teach. They do not seem to have time to read
					anything other than the brochures of drug companies.
					Students and teaching are 'inconveniences' to such teachers.
					For them, teaching plans and academic calendars are
					unheard of. Good and conscientious teachers, who constitute
					a minority, often find it difficult to follow serious academic pursuits in this atmosphere. Students also tend
					to believe that the teacher with the largest private practice
					is the best doctor and try to follow in his/her footsteps,
					perpetrating a vicious cycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another racket is the 'foreign and private employment'
					of medical college teachers. Their attachment to a medical
					college is only for its resum&#233; value as 'medical college
					professor', enabling them to regularly go 'on leave'
					to private sector enterprises or abroad. Some even go
					without sanctioned leave, because they are confident of
					'sorting things out' when they return. Such 'transient
					teachers' return to job only when promotions are due,
					and go back on another assignment as soon as possible.
					The tussle that follows when many return from leave to
					take the same 'promotion berth' might be seen as comic
					if it were not for the consequences to the public and to
					medical students.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet another scam is the way that reservation quotas have
					been used to block postings while teachers go on leave for
					lucrative assignments. Since these teachers do not resign,
					and their absence is never reported, their posts cannot be
					filled. The Public Service Commission does not recruit
					new staff, nor does the department fill the vacancies by
					promotion. So there are shortages of specialists in medical
					colleges, though such specialists are abundant in the
					'open market'. Those who are affected by this practice are
					patients and students. The latest example of this problem
					is the plight of Thrissur Medical College. Surgeries have
					come to a virtual standstill because there are no anaesthesiologists
					in the medical college, though there are plenty
					in the state waiting for placement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Serious teaching and research have been affected badly.
					Medical colleges in Kerala do not figure among the first
					50 in India in academic excellence or in research publications.
					Students rarely get encouraged to take up research.
					The few who are enthusiastic are disheartened by
					the uncongenial atmosphere. This is evident from the
					paucity of research publications from the medical colleges
					in the state. Unfortunately, doctors can acquire a
					postgraduate degree without even setting their eyes on a
					'peer-reviewed indexed journal'.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is in this scenario that a medical college teachers' association
					can state that students should tolerate 'rough
					behaviour' from teachers for their own benefit.
				</p>

				<h4>Are we going in the right direction?</h4>
				<p>
					Medical education is undergoing drastic changes in many
					parts of the world. Ethical considerations are becoming
					important. It is acknowledged that patients' autonomy
					and integrity must be honoured. Students must be inculcated
					with a gender perspective, equipped to deal appropriately
					with patients and their relatives, and sensitised
					to human rights. Senior teachers and professors are role
					models for their students. In their daily work they live
					out the ethical principles and etiquette of dealing with
					patients, showing by example how to address a patient,
					how to elicit consent for examination, how to interact
					with patients' relatives and so on. Such things cannot be
					taught in classroom lectures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, ethical considerations are often of least
					importance in medical colleges in Kerala, as is true in
					many other parts of the developing world. Patients often
					undergo examinations, sometimes even intimate ones,
					by any number of students without valid consent. Internationally,
					there are heated debates on difficult ethical
					issues such as allowing students to conduct intimate examinations
					<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Coldicott Y, Pope C, Roberts C. The ethics of intimate examinations&mdash;teaching tomorrow's doctors; BMJ 2003;326:97-101." id="7">(7)</a>. Students here are rarely sensitised to ethical issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the statement of the Medical College Teachers' Association
					truly reflects the opinion of the majority of its members,
					one has to realise the implications of such a statement.
					In such a situation, teachers rather than students
					must receive immediate attention. Their mindset of viewing
					patients and their relatives as potential enemies
					should not be allowed to further infect the student community.
					Teachers must be trained to change their perspectives.
					Our future doctors must be sensitised to human
					rights, ethical considerations and gender issues during
					their medical education, if not earlier. The key players
					in this effort are medical college teachers.
