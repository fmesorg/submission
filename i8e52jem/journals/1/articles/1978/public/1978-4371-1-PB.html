				<h4>Urban medical practice</h4>
				<p>
					The doctor,  fashionably attired,
					<br />
					With a long string of alphabets trailing his name,
					<br />
					Emerges from a fancy, air-conditioned limousine,
					<br />
					Driven by a liveried chauffeur.
					<br />
					He sees 'cases only by appointment',
					<br />
					In his air-conditioned consultation room,
					<br />
					But, despite the appointment, has little time to spare.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fancily designed, attractive waiting room,
					<br />
					With television, video- recorder and glossy journals,
					<br />
					And, perhaps, toys for his jaded paediatric clients,
					<br />
					Is presided over by young, beautiful secretary,
					<br />
					Who prefers talking to her computer or the phone.
				</p>
				<p>
					She collects sizeable fees before patients can enter the sanctum  sanctorum,
					<br />
					And instils awe and fear in the already demoralised patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nagged by outrageous competition,
					<br />
					The entry of young whipper snappers into his field,
					<br />
					And, to make matter worse,
					<br />
					The clutches of the Consumer Protection Act,
					<br />
					The doctor routinely lists a score or more of tests,
					<br />
					And prescribes an equal number of pills, potions and pokes,
					<br />
					Thus playing the game of safety - which
					<br />
					incidentally increases his revenue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Listening desultorily to the patient,
					<br />
					Whilst he dreams of his club, his wife and other attractions,
					<br />
					Prods here, pushes there and lends an ear to the lub-dub
					<br />
					Ere he agrees, with ill-concealed glee,
					<br />
					To accede to the humble request for an
					<br />
					unmerited sick leave certificate - for an
					<br />
					extra cost, of course.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, with a belch that's poorly suppressed,
					<br />
					He dismisses the patient with an airy wave and awaits the next.
					<br />
					Strange thought though it may seem, his patients
					<br />
					admire and adore him,
					<br />
					For he acquiesces to their demands,
					<br />
					And 'cures' rather than prevents.
				</p>
				<p>
					And the richer he gets,
					<br />
					And the more opulent his materialism,
					<br />
					The greater the throng awaiting him each evening!
					<br />
					Is this really what the public desire?
