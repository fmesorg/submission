				<h4>Patient's choice</h4>
				<p>
					According to recent  research, when patients have a choice, they are likely to choose a doctor of  their own race or ethnic background and they are more likely to be satisfied  with their care.

				<h4>Ban on drug ads</h4>
				<p>
					The Canadian Medical  Association (CMA) staunchly opposes the use of direct-to-consumer advertising  (DTCA) of prescription drugs as it feels that DTCA makes viewers think of  prescription drugs as consumer goods, ignores information about competing  products, may drive up cost of care and strain the patient-physician  relationship.

				<h4>Medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The authors review  empirical research that can guide physicians in deliberations over whether to  withdraw life support, maximizing patient and family involvement in the  decision-making process, and negotiating conflicts that may arise.

					When patients will not  survive, intensive care unit (ICU) teams discuss organ and tissue donation with  families. Recent legislation requiring ICU physicians to provide outside  agencies with confidential details of patients nearing death is controversial.  ICU physicians must act in the interests of the patient and his family,  notwithstanding the interests of the transplant surgeons. These inherent  differences between physicians need to be reconciled.

					While students need to  learn clinical examination by practising on patients, ethical dilemmas occur as  patients may be vulnerable and obtaining informed consent can be difficult. A  survey found that intimate examinations had been done in anaesthetized or  sedated patients, possibly without their consent. Two Ob-Gyn teachers say that  respecting the patient is the key to obtaining consent, and learning the  approach to the examination is even more important than the examination itself.

				<p>
					A study from the  University of Toronto reported two other types of ethical challenges;  responsibility exceeding a student's capabilities and involvement in care  perceived to be substandard. This study led to a policy that emphasizes  patients' rights, confidentiality, responsibility of clinical teaching staff,  and provides trainees with an opportunity to discuss an ethical situation with  a bio-ethicist without fear of repercussions.

				<h4>Patients as a source of information</h4>
				<p>
					This article examines  the inconveniences encountered by a patient during hospitalization for a  successful surgery. Patients usually cannot assess the technical quality of  care but are the best source of information about problems in a hospital  system's communication, education, and pain-management processes, which could  seriously compromise clinical care.

				<h4>Errors and adverse events</h4>
				<p>
					Authors surveyed  practising physicians and members of the public about the causes of and  solutions to the problem of preventable medical errors. Many physicians and  members of the public reported errors in their own or a family member's  care. Both groups supported the use of sanctions against responsible  individuals though they disagreed on effective strategies for reducing errors.  Blendon RJ. Views of practicing physicians and the public on medical errors.

					An editorial says that  collaboration between patients and physicians may be hard as they disagreed on  the critical issue of confidentiality. Physicians believe that confidentiality  will promote openness among colleagues; lay persons favour 'transparency' and  the pressure of public accountability. Lee TH.

					There is an unresolved  conflict between the public's desire for accountability and doctors' and  hospitals' fear of damage to their reputations and of malpractice liability,  though no link between reporting and litigation has ever been demonstrated. The  primary purpose of reporting is to learn from experience. The highly touted  Aviation Safety Reporting System attributes its success to three factors:  reporting is safe, simple and worthwhile. Reporting to state programmes may lead  to sanctions but if sanctions are limited to serious violations and if  hospitals get useful information then the programme may be perceived as  justifiable.

				<h4>Industry and medicine</h4>
				<p>
					Doctors and patients  need to be able to rely on the commitment of the regulatory system in their  country to put the interests of public health above the commercial interests of  the drug industry. However, over the past 20 years, governments succumbing to industry  pressure have restructured the system. The new system depends on industry fees  for survival and national agencies now compete with each other for industry  fees for regulatory work. This may compromise patient safety.

				<h4>Death penalty</h4>
				<p>
					Almost all executions in  the USA are now performed by lethal injection which is unique because it  simulates the intravenous induction of general anaesthesia. Doctors'  participation is essential for inmates with poor vascular access. Medical  professionals' organisations in the United States forbid participation in  executions, but most doctors are unaware of these guidelines.

					Two major aspects of the  death penalty in the United States directly involve physicians: how the death  penalty is carried out and who is subject to execution. Apart from  participating in various aspects of execution, physicians will now be involved  in determining who is clinically mentally retarded and thus ineligible for  execution. Removing someone from within the reach of the death penalty on the  basis of mental retardation is not unethical medical work. However, the medical  criteria used to diagnose mental retardation are vague. Therefore, physicians  have a special ethical responsibility to participate actively in the ongoing  debate over capital punishment.

				<h4>Conflict of interest</h4>
				<p>
					The General Medical  Council recently found that Mr Anjan Kumar Banerjee and his research  supervisor, Professor Timothy John Peters were guilty of serious professional  misconduct committed a decade earlier. This was not just a case of one doctor  covering up for another but of corruption at a senior level in academic  institutions that helped to conceal the misconduct.

					Advertisements are a  major source of income for medical journals. Yet 44% of advertisements would  lead to improper prescribing and 92% are not in compliance with the criteria  for advertising. Editors advise readers to not take claims in journal advertisements  at face value.

				<h4>Human rights</h4>
				<p>
					Western health  professionals and the public have a misguided image of the aftermath of war  that comes from the Judaeo-Christian traditions of confessing and forgiving.  Labels such as 'healing' or 'recovery' through 'processing' (of traumatic  experience), 'acceptance,' and 'coming to terms with the past' suggest that the  pathological effects of war are found inside a person and that the person  recovers as if from an illness. Victims want to reassert that the problem is  moral and collective rather than medico-psychological and individual.

					A global campaign to  integrate health and human rights in undergraduate and postgraduate medical  training was launched this year by Physicians for Human Rights-UK (PHR-UK) to  anchor the doctor-patient relationship firmly to human rights' principles and  to minimize discrimination by the medical profession.

				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>
					Research studies  commonly randomise patients between standard care and some new form of  treatment which the patient might have obtained directly from the doctor. Yet  patients are not told about this. This practice increases participation in  research studies, but the studies may therefore be of questionable ethical  soundness.

				<h4>Women's health</h4>
				<p>
					Large-scale clinical  trials of interventions have been started in developing countries for  preventing epidemic of HIV. The volunteers do not have access to basic medical  services, or to reproductive or human rights, posing ethical dilemmas for the  researchers. If possible, researchers and community members should try to  develop practical solutions to such dilemmas before studies are started.
