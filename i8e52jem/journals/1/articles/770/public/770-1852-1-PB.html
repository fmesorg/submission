					Pharmaceutical  companies have an important place in medical care, especially in India, a  country where the mortality and morbidity due to various diseases of  deprivation, communicable diseases in particular, are very high. Every year  hundreds of people still die from malaria for which chloroquine is a cheap but  effective remedy; thousands go blind due to lack of vitamin A, and millions  suffer from endemic goitre due to iodine deficiency. We have also the largest  number of people suffering from tuberculosis and leprosy in the world. At the  same time, India is technologically developed enough to be self-reliant, with  research capability for the discovery of new drugs. Unlike most other  countries, responsibility for the pharmaceutical sector in India is shared by  two ministries, the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals under the  Ministry of Industry and the Directorate of Drugs Control under the Ministry of  Health and Family Welfare.</p>

				<h4>Development  of the drug industry in India</h4>
				<p>
					The foundation of the modern Indian pharmaceutical industry dates back to 1901  when the Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works was established in Calcutta  (now Kolkata). However, till Independence, the country was dependent largely on  drugs imported from Europe. After Independence, pharmaceutical manufacturers in  India were encouraged to take up the manufacturing of basic drugs.  Collaborations were established with manufacturers in the US, Switzerland,  (West) Germany, Italy and the UK. During the 1950s and 1960s many manufacturing  units were set up throughout India. The Soviet Union helped set up five units  for manufacturing synthetic bulk drugs and intermediate chemicals, antibiotics,  vitamins and hormones, surgical instruments and medical equipment under the  public sector.</p>
				<p>
					Today,  in India, about 20,000 firms have licences to produce drugs and pharmaceuticals.  Of these, about 200 units are responsible for over 40% of total drug  production. Over the past few decades, the Indian drug industry has seen  phenomenal growth and emerged as an exporter. It is estimated that the Indian  drug market, at present, is worth more than Rs 100,000 million.</p>

				<h4>A  drug policy</h4>
				<p>
					The  first national drug policy emerged from the findings of the Hathi Committee  which was commissioned to study the operations of multinational drug companies  vis-&agrave;-vis indigenous companies and public sector undertakings. The committee's  recommendations, released in 1975, included: nationalisation of multinational  units, diluting foreign equities of companies coming under the Foreign Equity  Regulations Act; earmarking some drugs for public sector undertakings;  strengthening R&amp;D activities; abolishing brand name drugs; issuing licences  for formulations of only 117 drugs which the committee considered sufficient  for the treatment of the majority of diseases in India; measures for drug  quality control; disseminating unbiased drug information to prescribers and  consumers; monitoring of adverse drug reactions, etc. However, the Hathi  Committee also recommended differential mark-ups for essential and  non-essential drugs. This recommendation had a lasting undesirable impact.</p>
				<p>
					The  first National Drug Policy was declared in 1978, and has been revised thrice  since then, in 1986, 1994 and 2002. The question is: were these drug policies  at all rational?</p>
				<p>
					According  to the WHO, a national drug policy should be based on relevant background  information including the country's morbidity, mortality, health system, human  resources, and the organisation of the drug sector. A (rational) national drug  policy should include: a list of essential drugs; use of generic names of  drugs; criteria for drug registration based on safety, efficacy, quality,  health needs and cost; regulation, control and monitoring of drug prices and  drug promotion; centralised bulk purchase of drugs using international tenders  (for countries lacking manufacturing facilities), and national legislation on  patents to exclude pharmaceutical products from patent protection. How does  India's national drug policy measure up?</p>

				<h4>The  1978 Drug Policy</h4>
				<p>
					In 1978,  the Government of India declared a drug policy supposedly based on the Hathi  Committee report. However, the government diluted some of the Committee's  recommendations and rejected others. This was soon followed by the declaration  of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO,1979) which brought 347 drugs under  price control, dividing them into four categories according to how essential  they were deemed to be, allowing maximum profit margins to the least essential  drugs. The idea was that the lower profit margins from life-saving and  essential drugs (Categories I and II) would be compensated for by the higher  margins for Categories III and IV drugs. However, the result was that drug  companies decreased and even stopped the production of life-saving and essential  drugs and concentrated on the more profitable ones.</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Drug  policies 1986 and after</h4>
				<p>
					Some stated goals of the 1986 Drug Policy were to ensure availability of  essential life-saving and prophylactic medicines at reasonable prices;  strengthen quality control and promote the rational use of drugs; encourage  investment in new technologies and cost-effective production; and strengthen  the indigenous capacity for production of drugs. The 1987 Drug (Prices Control)  Order reduced the number of price control drugs from 347 to 142 and increased  the maximum profit margins for these drugs. Special concessions to ayurvedic  drugs resulted in thousands of such formulations, with some well-known  allopathic formulations being marketed as ayurvedic drugs. The 1995 DPCO dropped  the following drugs essential for public health: ferrous sulphate for anaemia,  and most drugs for tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, rheumatic heart disease,  rabies vaccine, cancer, tetanus, etc.</p>
				<p>
					The  pharmaceutical policy (2002) calls for further relaxation of production and  price controls. Production controls have now mostly gone except for bulk drugs  produced by the use of recombinant DNA technology, bulk drugs requiring in vivo  use of nucleic acids, and specific cell/tissue targeted formulations. It is expected  that less than 40 drugs will remain under price control.</p>
			</div>

				<h4>The  results</h4>
				<p>
					In the absence of a clear, comprehensive and rational drug policy, we continue  to see a distorted pattern of drug production and the proliferation of  non-essential, irrational and harmful drugs. Indian markets are flooded with  over 100,000 formulations; there is no system of central registration of these  formulations. These drugs are sold under numerous brand names rather than their  generic names. There has also been a phenomenal increase in drug prices.</p>
				<p>
					Despite  the phenomenal growth of the drug industry during the past five decades, the  availability of modern drugs is still low. For example, in 1984 only 5%-6% of  the population could afford the modern drugs they needed; another 25% had  limited access to essential drugs. A majority of the people living in rural  areas and urban slums, the main victims of endemic and epidemic diseases, had  little or no access to modern drugs. With the predicted increase in the cost of  drugs after joining the WTO, the problems are likely to go out of control.</p>
				<p>
					Since  1983, the government has issued various orders banning several harmful and/or  useless formulations marketed in India, but to little effect. Drug and health  activist organisations, under the auspices of the All India Drug Action Network  (AIDAN), went to the Supreme Court demanding implementation of the ban. Some  constituent bodies publish drug information bulletins for prescribers. In  general, representatives of pharmaceutical companies are the only source of  information to prescribers in remote areas. The government has taken little  initiative to fulfil its statutory function to monitor manufacturers'  promotional literature and has taken no steps to supply objective and unbiased  drug information to prescribers.</p>
				<p>
					Drug  and health activist organisations have recently intervened in a petition  challenging the government's recent move to further curtail the number of drugs  under price control. At the heart of these efforts is the principle of entitlement.  Neither the Constitution nor the National Health Policy guarantees the right to  health or to medical care including affordable and appropriate drugs. The  community of health professionals must recognise this right and help people  exercise it.</p>
