				<h4>Seth G. S. Medical College, Parel, Mumbai.  Anonymous, Department of Anatomy, Seth G. S. Medical College, Parel, Mumbai  400012. 1997 p 128. Paperback.</h4>
				<p>
					Most of us are troubled by doubts and  depression as we witness the general decline in standards of teaching and the  shenanigans of those in charge of private medical colleges. This book offers  solace and hope for here is a department attempting to build on past experience  and extend its capabilities in a pioneering effort at imparting a clinical  orientation to undergraduate anatomical education.
				</p>
				<p>
					The preface emphasises: "... An understanding  of the basic sciences is essential to a complete understanding of disease.  Pathology and clinical medicine, in their turn, improve one's perception of the  basic sciences. Each elucidating the other, they are inextricably linked in a  glorious, ever- expanding circle...The handbook is designed to serve as a  compass rather than a road map... It lets (the student) know what is most  relevant to later study... "
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. S. M. Bhatnagar sets the pace by  emphasising the relevance of anatomy to the medical student and to the doctor.  Dr. M. L. Kothari talks of the joy of studying anatomy and travelling along the  road that will serve both the student and his future patients without fail. Dr.  Lopa Mehta, head of the department, succinctly discusses the 'how' of learning  the subject, emphasising the use of both parietal lobes by an inquisitive mind  that takes nothing for granted.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next chapter provides a brief history of  the department with thumbnail sketches of the various helmsmen from Dr. R. P.  Koppikar to M. L. Kothari.
				</p>
				<p>
					Subsequent chapters introduce the reader to  the anatomy of the department of anatomy, its faculty, courses offered, the  academic calendar, dissection schedule, description of diagrams to be drawn by  each student in their journals and list of recommended texts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The student is then told of the system of  evaluation followed by the department. The top three levels consist of 'May  know', 'Desirable to know' and 'Must know'. Those ignorant of items grouped  under 'must know' are deemed to have failed. They may have stumbled in  understanding fundamental concepts (level four) or, indeed, have no concept at  all (level five).
				</p>
				<p>
					The appendix lists the syllabus prescribed by  the University of Mumbai.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why are we reviewing a book on anatomy in a  journal on ethics?
				</p>
				<p>
					First of all, the volume sets a moral tone  throughout. Consider this statement under 'Evaluation' : "The maximum attention  is paid... to provide such a milieu wherein students feel mentally and  physically free to have independent thinking, healthy interaction amongst peers  as well as with teachers and find their own self-confidence, self- reliance and  creative potentials. To sum up, the student cultivates a healthy attitude  towards life in general, and towards other human beings and life forms..."  Lofty ideals, indeed, to be heartily applauded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, the department has travelled far  beyond its mandate. Let me provide an example. It has established a library of  images - x-ray films, computerised tomographic and magnetic resonance images  and sonographic studies - that help the candidate link what has been seen in  the dissection hall to that seen in the living individual in the wards of the  hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					The department also provides financial aid to  needy students through donations from individuals, trusts and private funds in  addition to that offered by the Municipal Corporation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, by guiding the student thus, with  understanding and empathy, the volume sets a precedent that needs to be  emulated by other departments in the same institutions and those in other  institutions.

				<h4>Euthanasia</h4>
				<p>
					There is a long tradition of welcoming death as a positive good:  call no man happy, said the lawgiver Solon, till he dies, he is at best  fortunate.
				</p>
				<p>
					And Francis Bacon, who  achieved more philosophical detachment in his <em>Essays</em> than in his shady  financial dealings, wrote famously of the absurdity of the fear of death.  "Men fear death as children fear to go into the dark." <strong>&ndash; Theodore Dalrymple in So little done</strong>
