				<h4>Kerala's demographic transition: determinants and consequences. K. C. Zachariah, S. Irudaya Rajan (Eds). Sage Publications, New Delhi. pp. 367. Rs. 450</h4>

				<p>
					The  editors have already written extensively on the demographic situation in  Kerala. Zachariah earlier recommended "the undertaking of research projects on  Kerala's demographic transition.. . (including) an in-depth analysis of the  educational revolution in Kerala since 1950, and impact of this revolution on  fertility, mortality and migration trends. Similar analysis should be  undertaken on the health transition, the economic transition (particularly on  land reform, wage rates, wage structure, employment and unemployment) and the  development of the family planning programme in the state. Much of the needed  data are already available but the contribution of private sector in education,  health and family planning needs to be documented through additional data  collection." <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Zachariah KC.

					Kerala's  achievements are distinctly different from those of other Indian states.  Keralite women are better educated and live longer than Keralite men, and the  sex ratio favours females. And despite the widely-accepted link between economic  prosperity and declines in fertility and mortality, leading to the demographic  transition, Kerala has a poor record of industrial and agricultural growth.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ratcliffe's  decades-old study of the demographic transition in Kerala noted that a small,  densely populated state &mdash; with a per capita income income just 75 per cent of  the already low Indian average, and a population suffering from the lowest per  capita calorie intake &mdash; had the lowest infant and child mortality rates and the  highest life expectancy among Indian states.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is  an anomaly, even if Kerala does lead Indian states in other aspects of literacy  level, social development, female education, women's status and fertility  control. Many states spend more per capita on health. Kerala does not have  particularly well equipped health services, but shows the highest utilisation  rate of available facilities. Ratcliffe argues that Kerala's success owes much  to wide-spread education and political participation that enabled the  introduction of a distributive economic strategy characterised by more  equitable distribution of the existing limited resources, goods and services  and their more intensive utilisation. "... neither mortality nor fertility  declined to modern low levels until the organised sector was made demonstrably  responsive to the needs of Kerala's broad majority. As education and income  levels rose as a consequence of distributive policies, fertility and mortality  declined in response." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ratcliffe John.

				<h4>Kerala has the lowest infant and child mortality rates and highest  life expectancy among Indian states</h4>
				<p>
					In <em>Kerala's Demographic Transition...,</em> Zachariah notes that till 197l-81, Kerala had  one of the highest rates of population growths in the country. Today the growth  rate is below replacement level, indicating that population size will soon  start declining. Zachariah says that in 1968-78, about one-third of the  fertlity decline was due to an increase in age at marriage. Such a dramatic  change in societal behaviour in such a short span is unheard of, and one would  want to understand how it was brought about. The article also notes that the  decline in marital fertility has been much faster than in the total fertility  rate. Here, too, underlying factors need explanation.
				</p>
				<p>
					One  factor affecting education, marriage and fertility behaviour, according to  Zachariah, is the state's exposure to a variety of cultures. However, such  exposure is not unique to Kerala. Similarly, Zachariah writes: "the high  population density and peculiar settlement pattern in the state make land  reforms and other socioeconomic reforms more relevant for fertility decline in  Kerala than other states of the country." Population density in Kerala was more  than twice that of the rest of India even in 1901.
				</p>

				<p>
					A  number of unsupported statements are made in the Overview. How exactly does  education bring about changes in attitude and behaviour? Data from other states  do not demonstrate the same relations as in Kerala. It is also unclear what is  meant by the statement that with a changed economic perspective, children of  "higher quality" became desirable.
				</p>

				<p>
					The  contributions of Irudaya Rajan, and Mari Bhat, with many details on fertility  and mortality, present the reality in Kerala and also enable the understanding  of demographic techniques used to analyse the available data.
				</p>
				<p>
					Substantial  migration to countries in the Gulf has changed economic conditions for families  and also disturbed life patterns in the state. Thomas Isaac and Leela Gulati  discuss the economic and social consequences of this migration. Among the  problems now faced by people in Kerala are the the impact of the demographic  transition on aging, the quality of education and unsatisfactory levels of  morbidity in the face of declining death rates.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  book puts together several issues in the context of Kerala's population.  However, much needs to be known from other social scientists.
