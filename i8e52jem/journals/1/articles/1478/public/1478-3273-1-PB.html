					A three  day international conference on the role of health professionals in human  rights was organised by the Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes  (CEHAT) from November 28 to 30, 1998. <em>"Preventing violence, caring for  survivors, role of the health profession and services in violence"</em> was  inaugurated by Justice VS Malimath, member of the National Human Rights  Commission, who spoke eloquently on the state of human rights in our country  today, and the changes that need to be brought about.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Adriaan Van Es of the International Federation of Health and Human Rights  Organisation spoke about the work being done by their organisation and  emphasised the need for the human rights organisations all over the world to  work together.
				</p>
				<p>
					This was followed by a keynote address sent by Mr Jaap A Walkate, chairman of  the Board of Trustees of the UN voluntary fund for victims of torture, Geneva.  Mr Wal kate was unable to attend the conference because the Indian government  denied him a visa. His address spoke mainly of the possible involvement of  physicians in incidents of state violence. He emphasised that under no  circumstances should physicians participate in torture; when called to examine  such victims, physicians should be able to ascertain whether torture has been  inflicted, and treat the victim. They should not abet such torture by keeping  quiet.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ms. Binoo Sen, member secretary of the National Commission for Women, addressing  the issue of gender-based violence spoke of the need for health professionals  to adopt a pro-active policy that responds to women in distress, takes care of  their health needs and helps link the emotional and physical effects of  violence on women. Also emphasized was the need for the health community to  build linkages so that effective intervention could be made through support  groups and voluntary organisations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ms. Ann Sommerville, head the department of medical ethics in the British  Medical Association, spoke briefly about educating practicing doctors about  medical ethics, the link between human rights and medical ethics and the need  to develop global communication systems facilitating an international network  of health professionals, lawyers, patient advocates and human rights activists
				</p>
				<p>
					The later sessions were broken up into group discussions. The four main groups  addressed issues of violence against women; state violence; communal violence  and violence against minorities, and health care and response to violence.  During these discussions, Ms. Iris Tetford of the World Health Organisation  spoke passionately about the need to see violence against women as a public  health priority. She also discussed the 1996 World Health Assembly resolution  formulating a scientifically-based plan of action for the prevention of  violence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr Arvind Tiwari of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) spoke of  the CHRI's ongoing programmes and highlighted the role of medical officials and  paramedical staff in respecting the human rights of incarcerated prisoners,  while providing them care and treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ms Niraj Seth of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation spoke about mental health issues  of families affected by terrorism, emphasising the importance of children's  well-being and the need for intervention by mental health professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr James Welsh, coordinator, Amnesty International, London, who was also unable  to attend the conference after he was denied a visa, sent a message expressing  his disappointment. Health professionals in AI have sought respect for the  rights of asylum seekers and refugees, and the proper provision of medical care  to prisoners.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second day of the conference concentrated on the current health care  facilities and the need for treatment for survivors of violence.
				</p>

					Mr. Jagdish Sobti of the Communication Centre emphasised the need to train  medical practitioners in the management of victims of torture and violence and  informed the delegates of a new postgraduate course in this subject started by  the Indian Medical Association.

				</p>
				<p>
					On the last day, discussion focused on strategies, research issues and the need  for networking and joint action. Delegates made interesting inputs regarding  national and international policies, the role of health professionals in  treatment and rehabilitation, ethical issues, and the need for more intensive  community level campaigns.
