					In the section entitled <em>Vox Populi</em> in this issue we have reproduced seven extracts from news items  entitled <em>'The first Indian porcine xenotransplant'</em>. This episode raises vital issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our understanding on the use of a pig's heart  for transplant into a human being is that it is yet to pass trials in animals  and has not been cleared by any authorised agency for use in man anywhere in  the world, including India. The consideration of use of a pig's heart in man is  justified only when the pig has been so bred that it carries genes identical to  those in the patient in whom it is to be transplanted. Such a heart, it is  proposed, is less likely to be rejected by its recipient. The entire operation  of establishing genetic identity between the donor pig and recipient human,  ensuring that the surgeon does not transfer infections (especially those by  viruses hitherto unidentified) within the pig to the recipient in the process  of transplantation, and other attendant problems, have proved so formidable  that to date no surgeon elsewhere in the world has dared to perform such a  transplant. Indeed, the United Kingdon has banned any such transplant, pending  further research.
				</p>
				<p>
					And here we have a surgeon in poorly developed  Assam, who has twice claimed to have carried out such a transplant without any  enquiry into his credentials, experimental work, organisational facilities,  laboratory expertise, peer review and official sanction! Were it not for its  tragic aspects, such a claim would have verged on the ridiculous. The least  that is expected of the regulatory agencies is an immediate halt to all of  Baruah's activities. The Medical Council of India and that in Assam should have  investigated all aspects of his activities before he started his  transplantations. Instead, even after the events, we see no signs of any  activity on their part.
				</p>
				<p>
					The statement by the Health Minister of Assam,  Kamla Kalita, to the Assam State Assembly &mdash; that the Government "was examining  all legal possibilities so that adequate action can be taken against him for  trying to sensationalise the issue' &mdash; is even more pathetic. This  bureaucratese is easily translated: "We have decided to do nothing for the  present as regards the scientific aspects of Baruah's acts. At best we may  administer a gentle tap on his knuckles for promoting himself."
				</p>
				<p>
					Baruah has compounded his felony by flouting  all tenets of medical ethics. The news reports state that the patient, Purna  Saikia, sought treatment from Baruah after reading advertisements inserted in  local newspapers. Everything that Baruah does is shrouded in secrecy. The  reports also suggest that truly informed consent was not obtained. There was no  debate or discussion in any medical forum before undertaking this sensational  surgery. No details on the surgery and the progress of the patient after  surgery have been provided to the medical fraternity or the lay public. The  only information available is that ferreted out by journalists and this has  been horrifyiing, Heart, lungs, liverand pancreas were transplanted with  abandon and even the pig's blood was transfused into the doomed Saikia. We are  yet to learn the findings at autopsy.
				</p>
				<p>
					To add insult to injury, the laws of the land  have now permitted release of Baruah on bail. He has been directed not to  perform any further transplant without permission of our national medical  agencies. Presumably, he may continue other forms of surgical adventure.
				</p>
				<p>
					No authority has, as yet, seen it fit to  investigate Baruah's antigen-suppressing agent. Indeed, to the best of our  knowledge, no statutory body has investigated the earlier artificial valves  designed by him though the four phases prescribed for any clinical trial appear  not to be have been completed. The fact that the authorities in Hong Kong found  the use of these valves by Baruah and Ho a matter of questionable ethics and of  grave concern should have awakened our own authorities. Certainly, this should  have resulted in alarm bells ringing wildly when Baruah made his first  announcement on the proposed transplant of a pig's heart into man.
				</p>
				<p>
					Far from being repentent in any manner, Baruah  now brazenly announces his plans for further such operations. In the same  breath he speaks of an international conspiracy against him and plans for  presenting his "achievements' before experts in Barcelona and Sydney!
				</p>
				<p>
					If, as some suspect, Baruah is a victim of  psychosis, why is he allowed to roam the land, free to impose his deranged will  on the hapless poor? Shouldn't he be behind bars in an asylum, kept out of  harm's way? And if psychiatric assessment finds no evidence of insanity,  shouldn't he be kept permanently behind a similar barred portal in gaol in the  interest of public safety?
				</p>
				<p>
					As pointed out by Dr. M. K. Mani in an earlier  issue of this journal, our watchdogs continue to snore in bliss!

				<h4>Who will regulate when  regulatory bodies have proved hopelessly incompetent?</h4>
				<p>
					When such problems are posed to those whose business it is to solve such  conundrums &mdash; legislators and bureaucrats &mdash; one gets answers similar to those  provided by the Health Minister of Assam. Catch-22 is very much in evidence.  Here are three examples we have often encountered:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"There has been no complaint, so how can  we investigate?"</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					And there cannot be a complaint, for those who  should be registering it do everything possible to turn away the complainant.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"We are appointing a committee to look  into this matter."</em> &mdash; the eternal refuge  of the procrastinators! The committee report is never presented to the public  and actions taken on it are shrouded in secrecy. Certainly this expensive  exercise results in no punitive action against the rich, mighty and politically  well-connected and no improvement is evident.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Do what you like. If you wish, you can  even go to court."</em> When  multi-million-rupee corporations do all they can to avoid any appearance in the  court of law, knowing of the delay not of months or years but of decades, how  is the average citizen, with meagre funds, to fight against individuals or  organisations (such as hospitals) with immense resources?
				</p>
				<p>
					Well-meaning individuals have pleaded for  society at large to take matters into its hands by forming power groups. Thus  far this has not borne fruit as the widely disparate groups that make up our  society do not make such a coming together of dedicated minds easy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The fundamental  question</h4>
				<p>
					But all this bypasses the fundamental question that begs an answer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do those in power &mdash; governments,  bureaucrats, the judiciary &mdash; permit the continuation of regulatory agencies  that do not deliver? Why are the functionaries in these statutory regulatory  agencies never hauled up and severely penalised? Why are hopelessly inefficient  and apathetic medical councils permitted to survive? Why are they not scrapped  or recreated in such a manner that their existing failings are never allowed to  prevail?
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, newer regulatory agencies are  created. The National Human Rights Commission &mdash; in its role as regulator of  health care malpractice &mdash; is an example. We are driven to the state where we  draw consolation from the occasional dig the Commission has against the Medical  Council of India. That the pinprick may not even penetrate epidermal layers  protecting the Council members does not seem to worry anyone.
				</p>
				<p>
					And, as you might expect, the government that  does not feel it important to ensure that its original watchdogs do their  duties efficiently, cannot be expected to nurture this new watchdog. Writing in <em>The Hindu</em> on 24 December 1996, senior journalist Kuldip  Nayar referred to the deliberate neglect of the National Human Rights  Commission by the Government of India and those in the States.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"The Centre and States have not taken  human rights seriously."</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					It has become a fashion to talk about human  rights in drawing rooms. The elite probably consider them part of economic  liberalisation, giving another edge to their entertaining life. Most functions  held in Delhi on Human Rights Day were at posh places, followed by sumptuous  tea. Participants were in their best attire. Foreigners and Indians mingled  with one another, talking and laughing, as if it was a cocktail party hosted by  an embassy, or an industrialist.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"The Centre believes that it has done its  duty by setting up the National Human Rights Commission. So deliberate is its  neglect that even the Commission members, who were carefully chosen for their  pro-establishment record, have felt let down. None at the Centre has the time  either for the Commission's protests or its recommendations. Most of its  Commission members have not been able to meet even the Joint Secretary in the  Home Ministry, not to speak of the Minister. The Commission, despite the fact  that it is headed by a former Chief Justice of India, has been devalued like  the Commission for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes or the  Commission on the Linguistic Minorities."</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Kuldip Nayar goes on to comment on autopsies,  especially those on individuals who die in police custody: "It is an open  secret that doctors bow to police pressure when writing the report. Often,  there is a long time gap between the post-mortem and the report. Facilities in  many mortuaries are rudimentary. A suggestion that the post-mortem examination  be video-filmed has not been accepted by many States. They hate  transparency."
