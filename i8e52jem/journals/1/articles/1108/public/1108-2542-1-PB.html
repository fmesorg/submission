				<h4>What's the magic cure?</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has filed a writ petition in the Hyderabad  High Court, asking the government to take action against the administration of  a highly publicised, government-supported, traditional remedy for asthma. The  composition of the paste, which is inserted into a live fish and placed in the  patient's mouth, is a family secret. Thousands of asthma patients come to Hyderabad  for the annual ritual. The IMA has asked that the contents of the medicine be  made public, the family be prosecuted for violating the provisions of the Drugs  and Magical Remedies Act, and the government not promote this treatment.

				<h4>Doctor accused of  molesting patient</h4>
				<p>
					The arrest of a Mumbai infertility specialist on charges that he molested a  patient raises questions about the medical protocol in a gynaecological  examination. A couple complained to the police that Dr Anoop Gupta had asked  them to have intercourse in front of him in his clinic, and then tried to  molest the woman. Most specialists dub the alleged incident as 'too bizarre to  be true'. 'Only a mentally unstable person would do such things,' said one  doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  couple also went to the Shiv Sena, whose members assaulted Dr Gupta. About 500  doctors supported by the Indian Medical Association went on strike in protest.

				<h4>Buy your way to an MD</h4>
				<p>
					Medical students are guaranteed a seat at a top medical college if they  approach the right people and have money. Educational consultants sell seats  for a commission. Marks do not count, money does. 'We take about Rs 5 lakh as  advance and keep the original marksheets and certificates so that they do not  approach others,' says one agent. Extract from a conversation between a reporter  and an 'education consultant': 'What's your preference?' 'A Bangalore college.'  'The rates vary from Rs 23 lakh to Rs 27 lakh.'

				<h4>Insanity certificates  for a fee</h4>
				<p>
					The Uttar Pradesh government suspended Dr S K Gupta, a psychiatrist at the Agra  Mental Hospital, filmed taking bribes from men for certifying their wives  mentally ill so that they could get an easy divorce. Dr Gupta was shown taking  a wad of notes, writing a statement that a woman (who he has never met) is  under treatment for mental illness. He also admitted that he had done the same  for 10 other husbands who wanted to leave their wives.

				<h4>Medical debt</h4>
				<p>
					Janreddy's daughter-in-law is in bonded labour to pay off Rs 5 lakh in family  debts. Of this, Rs 3 lakh are her late father-in-law's medical expenses. Health  spending is among the fastest growing components of rural family debt,  especially in Andhra Pradesh where the state has destroyed the public sector  health care system, boosted the private sector and promoted corporate  hospitals. A common thread running through the farmers' suicides plaguing the  state has been high medical spending, all borrowed at absurd rates of interest.

				<h4>Doctors and Abdul Karim  Telgi</h4>
				<p>
					Two doctors were arrested for providing Abdul Karim Telgi (accused of running a  scam in government stamp papers) false medical certificates so that he could  get bail. Dr Jnanendrappa, professor of medicine at Victoria Hospital,  Bangalore, apparently shared the Rs 25,000 he received with administrative  officer Channa Keshava. Dr Jnanendrappa initially evaded arrest&mdash;by getting  admitted to hospital. Earlier, the press reported that doctors at the Karnataka  State Forensic Laboratory injected Telgi with sodium pentothal or 'truth  serum', a practice that constitutes torture according to the UN.

				<h4>Scientific curiosity or  bravado?</h4>

Colleagues and policy-makers describe his action as  bravado and unethical. The vaccine must undergo animal trials before it can be  tested on humans.

				<h4>Hospitals attacked for  patients' deaths</h4>
				<p>
					The death of 18-year-old Sunil Avasarmor in Rajawadi municipal hospital in  Ghatkopar, Mumbai, triggered off an attack on the hospital and staff, and a  strike by the staff. Sunil's mother stated that they were made to wait and then  sent away. The authorities claim he was examined on August 9 and told to return  the next day but did not till August 11.
				</p>
				<p>
					Less  than a month later, residents of Kurla, Mumbai, ransacked the Bhabha municipal  hospital when 15-year-old Harsha Nathani died a few hours after she was  admitted for accidental poisoning. A family friend said Harsha was treated by  untrained interns.

				<h4>Government supports  spiritual AIDS research</h4>
				<p>
					On the instructions from project director Salina Singh, the staff of the Madhya  Pradesh State AIDS Control Society are trying to locate AIDS patients to be  treated through spiritual methods by Baba Shree Nirvikar Path. The baba lives  at the home of BJP MLA Jalam Singh Patel. The treatment apparently includes  giving up non-vegetarian food, liquor, garlic and onions, and praying in  certain poses.
				</p>
				<p>
					Singh  admitted that she had sent an officer to bring AIDS patients to Patel's  residence. 'There is no harm in sending patients to someone who claims to cure  them by meditation and without charging anything for food and stay. We should  help a social cause like this,' she said. 'I directed my staff on the basis of  talks held among some ministers.'

				<h4>Patients slapped</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty-seven-year-old Sandhya Mondol was in labour at the NRS Medical College  and Hospital in Kolkata when an attending doctor slapped her to 'induce labour'  and make her 'cooperate'. She went deaf temporarily. Hospital staff call this a  standard practice when a woman's labour is delayed. A few weeks later, a  plastic surgeon at the same hospital slapped a 14-year-old girl when she refused  to take an injection before surgery.

				<h4>Sexual harassment</h4>
				<p>
					Women's organisations demonstrated outside the BYL Nair Municipal Dental  College in Mumbai, calling for action on a complaint of sexual harassment filed  three months earlier. Dr Vatsala Shetty had filed a police complaint and a  departmental complaint against Dr B S Banga, a professor at the college. Dr  Banga denies the charges. Dr Shetty says she has since been threatened by Dr  Banga's friends.

				<h4>Moonlighting</h4>

					A doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, apparently  markets nutritional supplements manufactured by a multinational company, for Rs  1,500 for 60 doses, to patients. Patients are given directions to a store  selling the supplement, along with a prescription signed by a faculty member.

				<h4>And now pathology  tourism?</h4>

					The UK government is considering shipping blood and urine samples of patients  of the National Health Services to India for clinical tests to cut costs.  SRL Ranbaxy started with trials in some private hospitals there, and is now targeting  the public sector. The samples would be flown to the company's main  laboratories in Mumbai, which already conduct clinical trials for large drug  firms. The laboratories are open around the clock.

				<h4>A glimpse of Nepali  health workers' lives</h4>
				<p>
					Inadequately funded, understaffed and caught between guerrillas and soldiers,  hospital staff at the only government-run facility in Rukum, mid-western Nepal,  struggle to do the best they can. Some patients are direct victims of conflict,  wounded by explosives or bullets. Thousands of others are indirectly affected  by under-nourishment, a lack of vaccines and unsafe drinking water. Many more  are beyond the reach of basic health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Set up  16 years ago, the hospital is partly supported by M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res. Its  15 beds are always occupied, with a long waiting list.
				</p>
				<p>
					'The  Maoists leave us alone,' says Bhabani Sharma, an ayurvedic doctor who heads the  hospital. The rebels take away up to half the supplies sent to outlying health  posts. Health workers say the Maoists also organise health camps and since only  they can enter interior districts, they are actually taking health care to the  villages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most  health posts in Nepal don't have personnel, and some health workers in others  have gone over to the rebels, impressed by their dedication.

				<h4>Doctors arrested for  treating criminals</h4>
				<p>
					The Joint Doctors Action Committee staged a demonstration outside the Karachi  Press Club demanding that Dr Akmal Waheed and Dr Arshad Waheed receive due  process, with the right to legal assistance and an open trial. The doctors were  accused of providing medical treatment to the perpetrators of an attack on the  Karachi Corps Commander's motorcade.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Shershah Syed, Secretary of the Pakistan Medical Association, said the doctors  were recorded as arrested after 15 days of illegal confinement at an  undisclosed location and produced before the court in a hush-hush manner. They  were denied their right to see their legal counsel and relatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					'It is  doctors' duty to treat patients regardless of their biases and prejudices,' he  said.

				<h4>The organ trade in  Pakistan</h4>
				<p>
					With no laws restricting the sale of organs, Pakistan is fast becoming a  trading centre for foreigners and wealthy Pakistanis. Many hospitals even  advertise on the internet, offering a transplant to anyone who can pay.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  buying and selling of kidneys is a regular practice at Pakistan's busiest  transplant hospital near Islamabad. The hospital's founder, Colonel Mukhtar  Hamid Shah, insists that while most donors are paid, the transactions are  ethical. 'Their economical problems can also be solved. They are encouraged to  donate their organs.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Transplant  surgeon Adib-ul Hassan Rizvi calls this the worst form of exploitation. 'The  only beneficiaries are the middleman and the doctors involved,' he says. The  vendor at the end of the day is in the same place he was earlier-minus a  kidney. Dr Rizvi heads the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation in  Karachi, the only transplant centre in the country providing treatment and  transplantation free of cost. He is pushing for legislation to outlaw the sale  of live organs and for the government to allow doctors to use cadaveric organs  for transplant-currently not an accepted practice in Pakistan.

				<h4>Ethics course for prison  doctors</h4>
				<p>
					US health personnel conspired in the abuse of prisoners in US-controlled  prisons in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A survey recently reported  that those working at Abu Ghraib falsified death certificates to cover up the  killing of detainees, hid evidence of beatings, and, on one occasion, revived a  prisoner so that he could be tortured later.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this  context, the World Medical Association's announcement of a web-based course to  help prison doctors detect torture and treat victims, is timely. The 12-hour  course designed for prison doctors includes guidelines on ethics and human  rights based on international declarations. The course is available free  of cost at http://lupin-nma.net.

				<h4>Registration of clinical  trials</h4>
				<p>
					The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors announced that trials  that begin enrolment of patients after July 1, 2005 must register in a public  trials registry at or before the onset of enrolment to be considered for  publication in those journals. The British Medical Journal has announced a  similar policy, with some differences in the criteria for the registry.  Registration of clinical trials would prevent the non-publication of  inconvenient trial results, a practice that distorts the body of knowledge  available for intelligent decisions on health care.
