				<h4>Refusal to care for people with  HIV</h4>
				<p>
					This study, based on a mailed survey to a random group of  Canadian dentists, had a response rate of 66 per cent. Thirty-two per cent of  respondents had knowingly treated HIV-infected patients in the last year. One in  six reported that they would refuse to treat people with HIV. Refusal to treat  was associated with a 'lack of ethical responsibility', fear of cross-infection  or lack of knowledge of HIV. The writers note: "These results have  implications for undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing education." Wonder  where we stand on the subject.

				<h4>The right not to tell?</h4>
				<p>
					The writers describe a prolonged negotiation,  over five years, between the parents of an adolescent boy with HIV / HCV  co-infection, and the medical professionals treating him. The doctors wanted to  inform the boy of his HIV and HCV status. The parents refused to permit this  until they were forced to, legally, when the boy turned 18. The discussion  illustrates the difficulties in making ethical decisions. Both doctor and parent  have good intentions for the child. Some questions for the medical professional  are: how does one respect the rights of parents as well as the emerging autonomy  of the child? Could a well-intentioned decision do more harm than  good?

				<h4>When parents think otherwise</h4>
				<p>
					What are the choices before a  paediatrician when an HIV-positive mother rejects medical recommendations on  breast-feeding and anti-retroviral prophylaxis? And what guides an appropriate  response? This article analyses the legal and ethical issues that arise as a  consequence.
				</p>
				<p>
					This problem has not yet arrived in India where only the rich  have access to such drugs, and insisting that women not breast-feed can be  simply idiotic. Still, doctors already certainly face ethical dilemmas in  choosing between two obligations &mdash; to protect the infant and to respect parental  decision making.

				<h4>Training, morale and material</h4>
				<p>
					This study analysed retrospective data  from 732 and prospective data from 960 nurses on needle stick exposures and near  misses, and collected information on staffing levels and survey data on the  working climate and risk factors for needle stick injuries from 40 units in 20  hospitals. Nurses from poorly-staffed and badly organised units were more likely  to report risk factors, as well as injuries and near misses. The remedy: improve  staffing, administrative support, and morale.

				<h4>Unethical practices by tobacco industry</h4>
				<p>
					This report based on an  investigation of tobacco company documents illustrates unethical practices  resulting from financial ties between the tobacco and pharmaceutical industry  with three case studies linking tobacco companies with firms marketing tobacco  cessation material. In the first, tobacco companies pressured pharmaceutical  companies to tone down educational materials accompanying the product. In the  second, they restricted the product's marketing, and in the third, subsidiary  tobacco and pharmaceutical companies of a parent company actually collaborated  in the production of a nicotine-release gum.

				<h4>Ethicist for a medical journal</h4>
				<p>
					This is a report on the Canadian  Medical Association Journal's appointment of surgeon John Dossetor as its  ethicist and ombudsman, the first appointments of their type for a Canadian  scientific publication". Dossetor, who coordinated Canada's first kidney  transplant, later supervised Canada's cadaver transplant programme at a time  when there were no ethics committees, and one heard frightening stories  about what doctors did in the patient's best interest. As a researcher, he grew  increasingly concerned about ethical dilemmas arising from medical advances,  including in his own practice when a patient brought someone willing to sell a  kidney. "It made me think that bioethics was becoming an increasingly important  field." But he cautions readers against expecting clear-cut solutions to  issues they raise. "Ethics is not about answers. Ethics is about asking more  questions."

				<h4>Ethics and public health research</h4>
				<p>
					The American Journal of Public  Health's Health Policy and Ethics Forum is a regular column for  "discussion on ethics in public health research and practice". The Forum  articles in the July issue look at research ethics. The editorial notes that  public health ethics is all about "the need to exercise power to ensure the  health of populations and at the same time to avoid potential abuses". One of  the papers in this section concerns the role played by institutional review  boards in the monitoring of research. The section also contains three  papers on non-therapeutic research on non-consenting subjects. Do parents have  the right to consent on behalf of their children? Two other articles on  international collaborative research look at the promises and pitfalls of the  genomic revolution, and on the need to recognise the rights and 'agency' of  vulnerable populations in the ethical review process.
				</p>
				<p>
					The issue also  contains a code: Principles of Ethical Public Health Practice, which has been  formally accepted by the American Public Health Association, and which is  available on www.apha.org/codeofethics.

				<h4>Informed choice in screening programmes</h4>
				<p>
					In the UK, there is a shift  towards 'informed choice' as an ethical imperative in screening programmes. The  authors look at whether such how this change will affect screening for risk of  coronary heart disease in primary care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Screening programmes are public  health efforts calling large populations to participate and benefit from the  information that might be obtained in such tests. In India, the health check-ups  advertised by corporate hospitals are essentially screening programmes, though  their value - as they are run today - may be questioned. One important component  of screening programmes is the positive message they send, that early detection  will be of benefit to the individual undergoing the tests. There is no mention  of the possibility of psychological and physical harm that can be caused by a  false positive test for cancer, for example, or the consequences of prenatal  screening results.

				<h4>An 'ethical market in live organs'</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial follows up on the  American Medical Association's decision to encourage studies to see if financial  incentives would increase cadaver organ donations. The authors describe 'an  ethical market in live organs'. Channelising the organ trade through a  single buyer, such as the government health service, would prevent exploitation  of the poor, ensure equitable distribution of organs, and address safety  concerns, they argue,
				</p>
				<p>
					"Nothing we have said rules out altruistic donation as  a mode of organ procurement alongside a commercial scheme; we would not wish to  discourage donation."

				<h4>Unethical drug promotion</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial comments on the ethical  problems inherent in pharmaceutical advertising, and discusses various efforts  to address the problem. Aggressive medical reps, medical sponsorship, direct to  consumer advertising... the list of dirty tricks is endless.
				</p>
				<p>
					The WHO's 'Ethical  criteria for medicinal drug promotion" are flouted with impunity; the  International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Associations' code of  pharmaceutical marketing practices is ignored in developing countries, and  efforts to monitor advertising material in journals rarely work. In India,  legislation on drug advertising has not been enforceable.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the writer  notes, students at a few medical colleges are being prepared for such tricks.  They are being taught to 'take control' of the interview with the medical  representative to be informed according to their needs, not those of the  industry.
				</p>

				<p>
					Such efforts may be tiny but incremental, and perhaps doctors will  start demanding ethical behaviour of drug companies. "Unless this demand comes  from the medical establishment who refuse to take lavish gifts, eat lunches and  dinners sponsored by drug companies, and attend CME programmes paid for by the  companies we can never expect drug companies to self regulate."

				<h4>Breaking bad news</h4>
				<p>
					How much should a physician tell his patient the
					whole truth about a potentially terminal illness like cancer?
					Should s/he speak to the patient or relatives? In a country
					like India, there are many opinions on this subject. Japanese
					courts have held that cancer disclosure is at the physician's
					discretion. This perspective is changing on the basis of
					legal decisions on medical malpractice cases. The author
					reviews these legal decisions, and notes the need for mental
					and physical support to the patient when making such
					disclosures.

				<h4>The culture of poverty?</h4>
				<p>
					The writer discusses some ethical aspects of  research in poor communities, which comes with extra obligations, since people's  autonomy will be compromised by their circumstances. At the same time, "Poverty  has its own cultural values, its own perception of beneficence, non-malfeasance  and justice, which may differ from those of the medical doctors and  researchers."

				<h4>Equity implications of managed care, and other ethical  questions</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial on the equity implications of managed care  comments on the discrepancy of a national health policy which claims concern for  equity while calling for a greater involvement of the private sector. For the  former, "govenments must be prepared to play a stronger role in the health  sector..."
				</p>
				<p>
					This issue of the National Medical Journal of India contains many  inputs of the non-medical type. Another editorial notes that current research in  injectable contraceptives is a direct product of coercive population policies;  neither will provide women with the choice of safe, effective and user-friendly  contraceptives. An Eye on the Web provides a review of internet resources on  medical ethics. And the letters from Johannesburg, Chennai and Mumbai provide  valuble pictures of the political, social and economic influences on health and  medical practice.

				<h4> Drug marketing</h4>
				<p>
					A former employee of the Warner-Lambert  Pharmaceutical Company in the US has filed a lawsuit against the company,  alleging that its sales representatives encouraged doctors to prescribe  gabapentin, an anti-epileptic, for other unapproved uses like pain, bipolar  disorder, and attention deficit disorder in children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unsealed court  documents show that some doctors were paid to let sales representatives into  their examining rooms to meet patients, review medical charts, and recommend  what drugs to prescribe, a totally "inexcusable" act. The company tracked  doctors' prescribing practices, rewarded 'high volume prescribers' with speaking  assignments and consultancies, paid them to enter patients in clinical trials,  and influenced doctors who wrote articles about gabapentin for medical journals  by paying them, sometimes secretly, and even hiring a marketing company to write  first drafts.

				<h4>Drug regulation</h4>
				<p>
					In the May-June 2002 issue of the Bulletin on Drug  and Health Information, Andrew Herxheimer describes the way in which drug  companies influence prescribing practices and the reasons for this, and proposes  a system to prevent conflicts of interest guiding medical decisions. The same  issue reviews the deaths following contaminated glycerin in JJ Hospital, Mumbai,  in 1986, when an investigation revealed a nexus between the drug industry and  regulatory authorities. But no lessons were learned, the writer points out, as  similar contamination killed patients 12 years later. In the absence of proper  quality control, and given the 'unholy alliance of drug manufacturers,  bureaucrats and their political masters,' we can expect more such tragedies in  the future.

				<h4>Unethical research in China by Harvard</h4>
				<p>
					Medical research in rural  China by a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, USA, was not  properly monitored to ensure participants' safety, according to an investigation  by the US Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP). The study conducted by  Professor Xiping Xu covered topics ranging from the genetics of lung function to  the effect of lead on reproduction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The OHRP investigation found that the  hospital ethics board lacked the expertise to review research and failed to  consider the cultural conditions, the social, economic and political status of  the subject population. The rural Chinese population do not benefit from the  study findings as they do not use western drugs. Consent forms in one study  failed to indicate that participation was voluntary, did not list the risks and  discomfort associated with tests and some had complex language. Numerous changes  reportedly were made to consent forms and the amount of blood harvested from  participants increased from two to six teaspoons. The hospital's ethics board  reviewed none of these digressions. Harvard has suspended all Chinese studies  while it reviews the research.
