				<h4>Distorted priorities in health policy</h4>
				<p>
					In response to the recent Parliamentary Committee's report on
					the PATH cervical cancer trials, a comment in DNA argues that
					the report has brought to light an issue that goes far beyond
					the PATH trials. This is the right of an independent nation to
					decide its own health policy, a right which has been threatened
					by the existence of "global donor agencies with pockets
					deeper than WHO but with a narrower approach and scientific
					acumen". These agencies, while funding massive immunisation
					campaigns in partnership with national agencies, decide the
					priorities of national health policy and these may not be in the
					nation's best interest. The comment analyses three examples of
					this trend: the HPV cervical cancer vaccine which was intended
					for use in the country's Universal Immunisation Programme
					even before being certified as suitable for the purpose; the
					pentavalent vaccine, a replacement for the older and cheaper
					DPT vaccine, which includes vaccines against hepatitis B and
					haemophilus influenzae type b. Its use has been controversial
					because of its price and its reported link with the deaths of
					vaccinated infants; and the costly rotavirus vaccine against
					diarrhoea, the inclusion of which have also been criticised.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author suggests that spending money on the improvement
					of nutrition and sanitation would have a far more durable effect
					on the health of the Indian people than making expensive
					additions of dubious benefit to the national immunisation
					programme. Over and above this, he says that the decisions
					on what to include in such a programme must be those of the
					sovereign government of the country, not of foreign agencies.

				<h4>Order on medical negligence compensation to be
				challenged</h4>
				<p>
					In a recent judgment, the Supreme Court enhanced the
					amount of compensation awarded in the Anuradha Saha
					medical negligence case to Rs 6.08 crore with interest, from the
					initial Rs 1.73 crore fixed by the National Consumer Disputes
					Redressal Commission (NCDRC). Of the total sum, Rs 25 lakh is
					to be borne by the three treating doctors, and the rest by the
					hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anuradha Saha, a young NRI doctor, was taken ill with recurrent
					rashes while visiting India. She was treated at the Advanced
					Medical Research Institute (AMRI), Kolkata and prescribed two
					doses of Depo-Medrol injection every day. When her condition
					worsened, she was admitted to AMRI, then to Mumbai's
					Breach Candy Hospital, where she died. At the latter hospital,
					her condition was diagnosed as toxic epidermal necrolysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Her death is said to have been caused by an overdose of the
					steroids administered at the AMRI.The 15-year-old case has
					taken many tortuous turns, culminating in the recent Supreme
					Court judgment. The judges increased the compensation
					based on the following principles: that the verdict would act as
					"a deterrent and a reminder to those doctors, hospitals, nursing
					homes and other connected establishments who do not take
					their responsibility seriously," ; and that the Supreme Court's
					own earlier verdict upheld the right to health as a fundamental
					right under Article 21 of the Constitution.
				</p>
				<p>
					The court expressed the hope that the government would
					pass legislation to ensure that patients who spend vast
					amounts of money, even borrowing funds, to secure their
					health are protected from negligence, especially in private
					healthcare institutions; and that medical professionals and
					institutions would update their knowledge regarding any new
					developments and rare diseases so as to avoid such needless
					deaths.
				</p>
				<p>
					The judgment has been criticised by the Indian Medical
					Association (IMA), which has decided to file a review petition
					against it. In a statement, the secretary-general of the IMA
					said it would send negative signals to young aspirants
					to the profession. Further, he said that in calculating the
					compensation, the court has taken into account the earning
					capacity of the young patient for an additional 30 years, but
					not that of the doctors and the hospital. He also objected
					to the fact that the judgment does not consider the rates
					of compensation in motor accident cases affecting healthy
					victims, unlike this case, in which the patient was already ill.
					The secretary-general added, "The compensation cannot be
					high if a rich patient has died and it cannot be low if a poor
					patient was a victim of negligence." The IMA has also reiterated
					its demand that medical services should be excluded from the
					scope of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and complaints in
					the field should be decided only by medical tribunals.
