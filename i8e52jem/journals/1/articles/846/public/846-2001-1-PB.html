					"All (that  researchers) are concerned about are their results and research. They do not  know what it means for the women, practically. For example, for an anaemic  woman a contraceptive means 20 days of bleeding. She is bound to feel sick,  even though she may be very keen to have a contraceptive. Yet Depo trials will  be conducted, simply because the US FDA has cleared Depo! Given such levels of  ignorance and a biased attitude it is difficult to speak of ethical aspects of  issues in reproductive health." (as I remembered her concerns may not be  her words in verbatim)
				</p>
				<p>
					This exemplified  Malini's worldview and her approach to the health care system. She felt  burdened by her membership of the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Research  in Reproduction. The ignorance she witnessed led her to question the  committee's seriousness of purpose. She used her thorough knowledge of  demography and of public health to understand the hardships women suffered and  to raise these issues in public. She enjoyed making sense of incomprehensible  statistical tables, and extracting the meaning behind dry figures. A sex ratio  adverse to women was not just a number; Malini saw it as an indication of the  low status of women in society. As a researcher, an academician and a feminist,  Malini fought for ethical and scientifically sound research of value to women.  The strong opinions that she voiced so often were based on serious work.
				</p>
				<p>
				It is in this spirit  that she vehemently opposed politics of fertility control that are played in  the name of 'unmet need'. She challenged the reductionist thinking behind the  concept of a Net Reproductive Rate, introduced in the Sixth Five Year Plan, and  warned that it would have disastrous consequences. Indeed, in parts of Haryana  the sex ratio has dropped to just 618 girls for 1,000 boys (Discounting Women.  <em>The Times of India</em> editorial November 15, 2002). Our government's focus on  population control is clearly going to result in a crisis. </p>
				<p>
					Malini had one mission  in life &mdash; to talk to as many people as possible and to communicate to them what  she had gleaned from her work. Her fearless and outspoken nature was  complemented by her experience in research. She could not see ethics as  separate from her concern with quality of life, from research and from her  commitment to people. She used to lament that population studies were getting  reduced to a sheer manipulation of numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Malini showed this  integration of the social and the academic beautifully in her critique of the  National Family health Survey. She criticised it for being undertaken for the  wrong reasons, for being conducted at great expense &mdash; and for not producing  information which could be used to raise public health concerns and improve  quality of life. As she put it, "In contrast to the results from censuses  one expects surveys to provide information on specific issues that can help in  planning. From the title 'National Family Health Survey' one expects that the  elaborate exercise will provide data on family and on the health of the India  population which individuals and organisations working in the field ... can use  in the planning of their work. NFHS has failed on this count too because it  does not provide any data on several issues that have been agitating the mind  of academicians and the activists in the field." (draft paper on the  National Family Health Survey: a Critique, 1995).
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1995, when the Indian  Women's Studies Conference dropped health as a theme in the conference she  challenged the decision in public with a two-page note to participants. She  argued that health was an important subject and could not be dropped from the  subject of women's studies, especially in the context of the National Family  Health Survey. She had questions about some of the work in the field of women's  studies. Characteristically, she did not stop at this challenge but went on to  write a short, sharp critique of the National Family Health Survey in a note  titled, 'Whose health is it anyway?'
				</p>
				<p>
					In Eclectic Streams in  Women's Studies, edited by Meera Kosambi and Veena Punacha, the contributor's  note states, "Dr Karkal's pioneering contribution to demography is her  premise that demography is a matter not of statistical calculations, but of  understanding society. She has long been propagating the idea that the problems  related to population growth, infant mortality, deteriorating quality of the  population, etc are related to the low status of women's health from their  childhood; and that unless this basic problem is addressed on a high priority  basis, the rest of related problems will not be solved."
				</p>
				<p>
					It is Malini's positive  and constructive way of dealing with issues that appeals to me. Anyone  concerned with ethics needs this ability, this positive attitude. Even while  she questioned the ethical basis of various actions she would think of a way  out, corrective measures. She made this contribution repeatedly, over the  years, in the various spheres of her activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way to carry forward  Malini's great passion and to pay her the ideal tribute would be to work  towards incorporating her insights into an ethical framework for research in  health, and particularly in research in reproductive biology.
