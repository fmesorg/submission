					The seminar 'Everything  but Medicine' was organised as one of the annual programmes of the Salelkar  Medical Foundation on August 24, 2002. The Foundation was established in the  memory of Dr Salelkar, a popular physician and leading internist from Goa. The focus  of the meeting was ethical and medico-legal issues in the practice of medicine,  and it was well attended, with representation from medical professionals of all  specialities and from various parts of Goa. I participated in the seminar on  behalf of the Forum for Medical Ethics Society.

					The meeting started with  a talk on 'How to avoid consumer courts' by Dr Shah, an orthopaedic surgeon and  medico-legal expert from Gujarat. His talk was a typical enumeration of  'precautions' that doctors should take so that they do not get involved in  medico-legal tangles. The emphasis was on protecting oneself with defensive  practices rather than on rational and standardised practice. Dr Shah was  followed by Dr Keiki Mehta, a senior ophthalmologist from Mumbai, who spoke on  'How to market yourself ethically'. This lecture consisted of tips from this  senior successful private practitioner on how to enhance one's image in the  market of medicine by the use of subtle techniques which do not smack of  'advertising' and thus invite criticism. For example, Dr Mehta suggested that  getting favourable reports on one's work and clinic in the lay press could be  very useful. Or one could train one's clinic staff to impart information on  one's competence, in a matter-of-fact way, while talking to waiting patients.

					This was followed by a  talk on 'Patients' perceptions' by Dr Sugandha Johar, a management consultant,  who spoke on how patients find their doctors wanting in communication. She  tried to make her point by role playing and by quoting various published  studies on the subject. Her effort to point out the medical profession's poor  emphasis on providing information to patients was, however, met with hostility.  The audience responded with a barrage of questions rather than reflection. Many  of them questioned the right of Ms Johar, who they said was a 'non-medico', to  bring up such issues.

					The meeting ended with a  panel discussion on the Medical Council of India's revised Code of Ethics,  2002. The panel consisted of a representative of the Goa Medical Council, a  representative of the IMA, Goa, and myself representing the Forum for Medical  Ethics Society. I presented a brief background to the MCI rules. I spoke on the  historical evolution of medical ethics. Society recognised medicine as a  profession and expected in return that the profession would regulate itself.  The medical councils had a central role in this self-regulation. In India the  failure of self-regulation had led to intervention by the state and the  judiciary, and the promulgation of various laws. Finally, I emphasised that the  basic principles of the so-called 'new' provisions in the MCI's Code of Ethics  were actually present in the previous set of rules in a different form and all  of us as practising doctors in India were already signatory to these. Many of  the new guidelines were necessary to respond to new areas of concern - such as  human rights, torture, euthanasia, recognition of brain death, sex  determination and sex selective abortion, IVF and artificial insemination.  Also, recommendations like compulsory CME and the use of generic names of drugs  for prescription would actually increase the credibility of the profession in  the public eye. Thus, if we recognise the amendments are mainly responses to  the changing pattern of medical practice, the emergence of new technologies,  and pressure from activists and from international agencies, we would be in a  much better position to respond to them.

					The representatives of  the Goa Medical Council and IMA were candid in their description of falling  ethical values in the practice of medicine in Goa. They lamented that all the  'unethical' practices which were associated with big cities were now rampant in  Goa. They largely supported the idea of self regulation and in fact suggested  that Goa should take the lead in the process of introspection and reform in the  profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the last few years  the health care system in Goa is changing rapidly from a predominantly  state-run system to a privatised one. Overall it was a little disappointing to  see the seminar follow the fairly predictable pattern of meetings of medical  professionals on 'ethics' in which the emphasis invariably shifts to  'medico-legal' issues, especially the Consumer Protection Act and its fallout.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was obvious from the  audience's response that the defensive and hostile response of the medical  profession in India, to regulation over the last decade, is reflected in Goa as  well. However, the fact that a large number of doctors spent a good five hours  discussing and debating these issues may be a positive sign. Also, the rather  frank admissions by the representatives of the Goa Medical Council and the IMA,  about the need to stem the decline in ethical values, were encouraging.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the true tradition of  Goan hospitality, the meeting ended with a variety of cocktails and a sumptuous  meal. Also, in a departure from meetings in big cities, many of the  participants were seen stridently and ferociously debating some of the issues  well beyond midnight. Whether this was a result of the stimulation of wine or  the meeting's deliberations, it was indeed promising.
