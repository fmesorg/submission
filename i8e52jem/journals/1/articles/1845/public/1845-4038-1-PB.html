              <h4>Medicine: trade or profession?</h4>
              <p>
                In the past few years, Indian doctors have often been asked this question. In  the present context of commercialised medical practice, there is a strong  public feeling that doctors have become traders. Doctors, on the other hand,  have reacted in a contradictory manner. Some have found the label 'trader' offensive  and refuse to participate in any debate on the subject. Others have, at least  implicitly, accepted that a large part of present day medical practice is  nothing but trading by qualified as well as non-qualified medical technicians.  Such doctors have, when cornered, attempted such defenses as, '<em>We are a part of  society. Since it is heavily commercialised, why blame us?</em>' The Indian professional can now lay claim to  just two major characteristics: first, unlike a lay trader, the professional is  highly educated, qualified and skilled; second, he does work for maximising  income.
                </p>
              <p>
                Some time back, in a  small town where two of my friends practice medicine, one as general  practitioner (GP) and another as a consultant, I had. an interesting  experience. My GP friend had referred a patient to my consultant friend. The  patient called up the GP after visiting the consultant to complain that the  consultant had charged an abnormally high fee. The GP turned around and  lamented on how rapidly standards were deteriorating. <em>'See, our idealist friend  has become a professional.'</em> This was meant to be a criticism, an expression of disapproval and shows how a  term which once gave a sense of pride to doctors has changed its connotation in  the minds of doctors themselves.
                </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, there is a  sense of unease amongst most doctors when they are called traders instead of professionals.
                </p>
              <p>
                The word profession is  derived from the original Latin profile or which conveys a meaning of making a  public statement of commitment, promise, announcement or confession. When one  refers to a dictionary, one finds that the term is restricted to learned  occupations and religions. A profession is not merely an occupation of highly  learned and skilled technicians. It also includes a strong and inseparable  moral commitment made publicly. In medicine, this avowal of morality has behind  it a tradition of many centuries. This is the reason why in the present  completely commercialised environment there is inevitable tension between the  traders in medical practice and those committed to giving primacy to healing  the sick. That is also why even in an environment dominated by market ideology,  it is not simply the wealth of doctor which gives him or her social and moral  authority. A substantial part, if not almost all of that authority is derived  from the public perception of the extent to which the doctor follows the  ethical traditions of medicine. Ethics has become a force both within and  outside the medical profession, shaping its contours and the behaviour of its  practitioners.
                </p>
              <p>
                The professionalisation  of medicine ensured separation of overt trading practices from the activities  of the medical professional. Earlier, the doctor, while healing the sick, was  also compounding drugs and selling them to the patient at a price. This custom  endures in some parts of the world. In most countries, compounding and/ or  selling drugs is no longer considered to be a part of the activities of the  modern medical man. It has been entrusted to the chemists who evolved from the  apothecaries. The apothecaries formed a 'lower' class of doctors: less educated  and less skilled, who sold drugs directly to patients.
                </p>
              <p>
                In our country this  separation of doctors from chemists is ordered by law. Whenever doctors or  hospitals have tried to store drugs for sale to patients, the chemists have  protested against this infringement over their occupational territory.  Similarly, another trading practice - 'fee splitting', or 'cut practice' - is  also considered outside the realm of professional medical practice. This is why  the profession as a whole is reluctant to admit its existence in public despite  the existence of widespread cut practice in our country.
                </p>

              <h4>Place of ethics in the medical profession</h4>
              <p>
                The practice of medicine  has a special characteristic not found in pronounced a manner in other  occupations. Doctors deal directly, and at the time when person is most  vulnerable, with the immediate issues of life and death, health and illness.  The patient is heavily dependent upon the technical knowledge and integrity of  the doctor. The doctor thus has an unique involvement with the patient, but  this relationship, between doctor and patient, is not balanced. The patient's  attitude is a complex of trust (which comes from perceived competence and  integrity of doctor) and, paradoxically, also that of distrust which comes from  the state of uncertainty and vulnerability.
                </p>
              <p>
                This ambivalence in  doctor-patient relationship is addressed by medical ethics, which tries to  guarantee the patient that the doctor will not abuse his dominance in the  relationship. Thus, medical ethics is essentially a regulatory mechanism that  makes the doctor commit publicly that though medical practice is the source of  his living, he will strive to the utmost for the benefit of the patient and not  be driven by lust for mere personal aggrandisement.
                </p>
              <p>
                This basic understanding  of medical ethics pervades - history, both in its modern: period of  professionalised medicine and in pre-modern medical practice. The  professionalisation of medicine only elaborated the scope and role of medical  ethics in the practice of medicine. In order to wipe out all traces of  'trading' from the minds and acts of doctors and to reassure patients, pioneers  advancing medical ethics took great pains to severely restrict internal  competition, poaching of patients, fee splitting and other practices that are  commonplace in the-world of commerce but have no role in medicine.
                </p>
              <p>
                The 19th century saw the  development of elaborate measures towards this goal in the Western medical world.  Doctor-to-doctor relationship was regulated. This paid huge dividends to the  medical profession. It helped the profession by wiping out 'external'  competition from quacks, midwives and others and consolidated its monopoly over  medical practice. Stress was then laid on the doctor-patient relationship. The  integration of the democratic principle of patients' rights in the explicit  ethical framework followed.
                </p>
              <p>
                It was only in the 20th  century, under the pressure exerted by the creation of national health services  in the European world, the involvement of the legal profession in ensuring a  better deal for patients and malpractice litigation that greater public  accountability by the medical profession became mandatory. This led to the  elaboration of patient's rights as an autonomous individual in the codes of  medical ethics. Interestingly, the issues of the doctor's competence,  systematic and periodic peer review of his health and medical knowledge as  criteria for judging fitness to practice were elaborated only in last quarter  of this century.
                </p>
              <p>
                There is nothing to  suggest that historically, ethics governing medical practice are unchanging and  form fixed categories. Although ethics seem to be emanating from moral  principles, giving an impression that the moral doctor is ethical, in fact both  morality and moral principles are found to be ever evolving, consequently  changing material relationships between the medical profession and society in  general; and between doctor and patient and doctor and doctor in particular.  The concrete shape of ethics in medicine is embedded in the contemporary,  material, social reality rather than in any abstract moral philosophy or moral  principles. The relationship between law and ethics is indicative of the  changing reality at any given time and is a good guide for analysis of trends.

              <h4>Self-regulation of medical practice</h4>
              <p>
                The concept of self- regulation is strongest in the medical profession. The only other profession  which, perhaps, could boast of more autonomy and greater self regulation is the  priestly community and those involved in the work of religion and theology.  Self-regulation implies a voluntary and internal regulatory mechanism within  the profession, irrespective of whether such controls are demanded by law or  others outside the profession.
                </p>
              <p>
                This concept can be  traced to ancient times. The traditions set up by Caraka, Susruta in India,  Hippocrates in Greece and other medical sages elsewhere are examples of this  concept in practice. The oaths named after them and the obligations they  enforced from their pupils were not legal documents. Rather, they exerted  authority on the basis of the relationship between teacher and student and the  examples offered by the teachers, gaining a sanctity that few laws can match.  The extremely high standards they set prompted the acceptance of these oaths by  subsequent professionals in medicine right up to the present as the basis for  medical ethics. In our own time, these moral codes are used during the  initiation of neophytes into the profession and for self-regulation by medical  practitioners belonging to private, voluntary associations. They provide moral  foundations for self-regulation and a justification for the autonomy of the  medical profession.
                </p>
              <p>
                This autonomy provides  doctors great flexibility in their work. It permits improvisations and  innovations, without which the science and art of medicine cannot progress. It  also gives them the authority to determine reasonable standards of practice  based on acceptable scientific practice at any given period. Autonomy is,  however, a double-edged tool. The monopoly of medical practice can allow and  has, in fact, permitted many members of the profession to deviate from its  social obligations, Using its control over medical education, such monopoly can  make and has made the entry of individuals in the profession so difficult that  there is a gross short supply of doctors to society or ensure that there is a  perpetuation of dynasties within the profession. Autonomy can and has led to  more power to doctors in relation to patients and abuse of such powers. The  pursuit for profit and high income can and has led to the neglect of healing  objective. These and many other ills that go with irresponsible autonomy make  it mandatory that professional groups prove their responsibility by strict  self-regulation and disciplinary action against erring members. They must show  society that the freedom and latitude awarded to them are not misused. The  implicit existence of self-regulation is not sufficient. Self-regulatory  mechanisms must have sufficient transparency before they can gain credibility  in the public eye.

              <h4>Law and medical ethics</h4>
              <p>
                Frank Grad, a professor  of law, in his article entitled 'Medical Ethics and the Law' in Annals of the  American Academy of Political and Social Science', commented: 'It is part of  our folklore that once we were a free people, with physicians, lawyers and  others carrying on their professions free from burdensome regulations,  exercising their best professional and ethical judgments, responsible only to  themselves and to their peers, in accordance with norms expressed in codes of  professional societies in which they were free and voluntary members.  Historical facts do not match folklore. Physicians have been a regulated  profession for quite some time. Indeed, the practice of medicine was one of the  earliest fields in the United States to be subjected to licensure and to  regulatory controls concerning education and training and elements of personal  and ethical fitness.'
                </p>
              <p>
                It is true that absolute  autonomy and moral self-regulation are nothing but folklore in the modern  context. Historically, doctors, themselves, have fought bitterly against  established medical vested interests and other political powers to persuade  society to promulgate laws for registration (licensure) of doctors and control  over medical education. The 18th and 19th centuries were marked by the struggle  of doctors to get legal recognition of their autonomy and self regulation. This  of course was necessitated by the emergent socio-political order based on  private property, 1iber; al democracy, industrialisation and formation of  nation states. Within medicine, the monopoly of a small learned group to be  harbingers of medical knowledge was challenged by the emergence of scientific  medicine. These factors created historic changes in the Western world,  originating in England, for changing from informal, voluntary autonomy to  formal and legal autonomy and organised self-regulation by such bodies as the  General Medical Council.
                </p>
              <p>
                The current larger  framework of autonomy and selfregulation within which the medical profession is  governed is also a legal framework. There are two broad aspects which  distinguish medical self regulation from that by the law.
                </p>
              <p>
                Within the legal  framework, Medical Councils have been given sufficient powers to regulate  members of the profession. Professionals on these Councils can carry out their  regulatory function using their 'scientific' and 'moral' expertise. The  morality of ethics, with strong roots in the Hippocratic tradition, has  therefore helped shape modern codes of ethics. The scientific expertise has, of  course, helped in shaping the medical training and the standards of medical  care. (While such regulations are formulated under legally created Medical Councils,  voluntary professional associations have played and must continue to exert a  very important role.)
                </p>
              <p>
                The profession is also  given power to implement regulations formulated by itself. The profession,  thus, not only decides the details of its regulatory mechanism, but uses its  own members to implement it. Here, to use an example, the liberal democratic  principle of separating functions of legislation/ executive and judiciary is  waived in favour of providing autonomy to the profession.
                </p>
              <p>
                It is normally accepted  as a rule that ethics is something more than law. The formulation of various  aspects of ethical code is based on ethical principles which are in many ways  different from legal principles. Ethics govern conduct. Principles based on it  thus delve into fine aspects of the conduct of doctors. Ethics and its  principles also come into play to resolve recurrent ethical dilemmas in medical  practice. As the occurrence of a particular dilemma increases and as its  resolution in a certain manner gains general acceptance within the profession,  it gets integrated into the code itself. This creates a dynamic mode which  makes the ethical code progressively more elaborate. Laws are circumscribed.  Their elaboration by the judiciary is also greatly limited. Since the profession  acts as law maker as well as its implementing agency, its elaboration is wider.
                </p>
              <p>
                The point of ethics  being more comprehensive than the law has a practical implication on medical  malpractice and judicial remedies available against it. Legal recognition of  medical malpractice is confined to violation of a specific law, criminal nature  of malpractice and admissibility for compensation. For instance, compensation  can be sought only if harm and loss are demonstrated. Whilst malpractice not  resulting in loss and harm does not qualify for compensation, such malpractice  can still qualify as unethical conduct inviting penalty on the doctor.
                </p>
              <p>
                There is another  interesting relationship between the law and ethics. Since autonomy and self  regulation are not merely ethical principles but are backed by law, the self  regulatory code has legal value and significance. Once specific clauses are  accepted by the profession as part of a self-governing code, they acquire  legal validity. Aggrieved patients can haul up professionals erring against  such clauses before the court of law. Medical Councils in our country, and, to  a lesser extent even in the countries of their origin (Western Europe) have  shown inadequate efficiency in the stringent implementation of self-regulation  by doctors. Patients and public organisations have ample scope under the law  for making them respect their legal obligations.

              <h4>A lesson for the medical profession</h4>
              <p>
                Professor Grad's  statement (quoted above) also high lights an emerging trend that can only be ignored  by the medical profession at its peril. Failure of doctors to put their house  in order must, inevitably, bring in its wake regulatory mechanisms imposed by  society on the profession in the form or legal and other restrictions. Such  impositions are likely to be beyond amendment by the profession. If, then, the  profession is to safeguard its autonomy it must remain true to the principles  of ethics and maintain total transparency in its dealings with patients in  particular and the public at large.
