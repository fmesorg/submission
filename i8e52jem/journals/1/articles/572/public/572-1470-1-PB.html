					Vaccines are intended to prevent disease. In 1798, Jenner  used the principle of an animal virus that caused a localised lesion but  afforded protection against severe disease. This started the practice of  &quot;vaccination&quot;. The idea of preventing disease and avoiding unnecessary  suffering is attractive, but since vaccines are generally given to prevent  disease in people who do not already have it, they must not themselves cause  disease, or at least no more than acceptable discomfort <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fay KE, Lai J, Bocchini JA Jr. Update on childhood and adolescent immunizations: selected review of US recommendations and literature: Part 1.

				<p>
					It is incredible how quickly it is possible for diseases to  disappear and how people are left with only a vague remembrance of them with  the passage of time. They find a place only in the tales of our grandparents'  generation, and then not even that. Smallpox, which once devastated regions and  countries, has been eradicated. Polio and the ubiquitous calipers and braces  (and earlier still, the &quot;iron lungs&quot;) have been long gone from industrialised  countries. India is planning a switch to an injectable vaccine to avoid the  damage to one in a million vaccinated children who develop paralysis <em>because </em>of the oral vaccine. Neonatal tetanus, a horrible experience in  which the helpless child bends and arches in ways that seem impossible, is a  rare event now that mothers are immunised during pregnancy. Measles, whooping  cough and diphtheria continue to afflict us, but are no longer the large-scale  killers that they once were in all regions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaccines have been a remarkable success story, but although  there are dozens of vaccines that are available and administered to children  and adults, several of them are for diseases which are restricted to certain  regions, such as the Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, and others are  restricted for reasons that have nothing to do with the absence of disease.  Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a US federal agency  responsible for public health, recommends vaccines to confer protection against  16 infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis  B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type B,  polio, influenza, and pneumococcal disease <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Birth-18 years and 'catch-up' immunization schedules. Atlanta, GA: CDC; 2013. Available from: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/child-adolescent.html." id="2">(2)</a>. The BCG vaccine is not  recommended for everyone in the US because tuberculosis is not a disease of  major public health significance there. American children are given 14 of these  vaccines in the first two years of life. Of the basic package of 16 vaccines, Indian  children in all states receive only BCG and five other vaccines (if they  receive immunisation at all), and in some states, this may go up to eight other  vaccines. This is despite the fact that  all these vaccines are available in India. With the exception of the seasonal  influenza vaccine, all of them are given to children who can access private  healthcare.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why is this? Why can a country that has built its own space  and atomic energy programmes not deliver a basic intervention to its children?  The infrastructure for delivery exists and vaccines are not an expensive  intervention for the value they deliver. Their value can be measured not just  in terms of the suffering averted but also in real economic terms. Vaccines  prevent disease, and the prevention of ill health and suffering is an  investment in the country's future <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bloom DE, Canning D, Weston M. The value of vaccination.World Economics. 2005 Jul&ndash;Sep;6(3):15&ndash;39." id="3">(3)</a>. It is true that the provision of access to healthcare in India is  difficult, that challenges abound and that there are enormous hurdles. However,  an advantage of vaccines is that they can be delivered according to a schedule,  so that the demand for them and the location where they have to be delivered  are predictable. Further, since they are given generally to healthy children,  other than monitoring for rare serious adverse events, little more is required  than a &quot;well-baby&quot; check-up and vaccination by trained primary healthcare  providers who follow a protocol.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course it would be ideal to have services available to all  across the continuum of care, but if we cannot deliver curative healthcare, can  we not at least try to provide services for the prevention of disease as part  of primary care on the widest possible scale, with at least as many vaccines as  children elsewhere receive? Bangladesh and a host of other poorer countries perform  better than India in the delivery of immunisation, both in terms of the number  of antigens and the coverage rate <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sayem AM, Nury AT, Hossain MD. Achieving the millennium development goal for under-five mortality in Bangladesh: current status and lessons for issues and challenges for further improvements. J Health Popul Nutr. 2011 Apr;29(2):92&ndash;102." id="4">(4)</a>. It is true that there are challenges to  be confronted, particularly in systems in which the same staff and structures  are responsible for both preventive and curative services, but approaches to  strengthen the routine delivery of preventive and primary care services will go  a long way to ensure the protection of all Indian children (and not just the  rich) from disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					Accepting the responsibility for protecting its population  from internal and external threats is the remit of the government. Just as  protection from aggressive neighbours requires investment, there is at least an  equal and considerably more urgent need to invest in protecting the population  from the preventable threats of infectious disease. Compared to an annual  &quot;formal&quot; defence budget of Rs 2,03,672 crore (12.3% of the central government  expenditure or 1.79% of GDP) <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Behera LK. India's defence budget 2013â€“14: A bumpy road ahead [IDSA comment]. New Delhi: Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis. 2013 Mar 4 [cited 2013 Aug 14]. Available from: http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/IndiasDefenceBudget2013-14_lkbehera_040313." id="5">(5)</a>, India spends about Rs. 600&ndash;700 crore on its  national immunisation programme annually. Of this, we are told that Rs 200  crore is the cost of vaccines. The inadequacy of this investment defies any  kind of logic.
				</p>
				<p>
					We know that when vaccines are evaluated in situations in  which delivery of healthcare is excellent, the incremental advantage shown by  the introduction of the new vaccine is less than that of comparable  interventions in previous decades, or that of interventions in areas where the  access to curative health services is deficient, However, vaccines, and oral  rehydration therapy, are still considered among the most cost-effective public  health interventions for childhood diseases, according to the CHOICE guidelines  of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which compare the relative value of  investments <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Evans DB, Tan-Torres Edejer T, Adam T, Lim SS, for the WHO CHOICE MDG Team. Methods to assess the costs and health effects of interventions for improving health in developing countries. BMJ.  2005;331:1137&ndash;40." id="6">(6)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is clearly an ethical need for equity in the provision  of access to vaccines, but it is not against preventable disease alone that  protection is needed. There are three kinds of protection required for the  ethical, equitable use of vaccines in India. The first is, of course, against  disease. The vaccines available are considered and a case is made for or  against their use in the public health programme. The second is protection from  harm. For this, the immunisation programme must ensure that any possibility of  damage, either because of errors in the delivery of the programme or because of  the product itself, is minimised. The third is protection from misinformation,  which requires that opinions are not presented as facts, and that  pseudo-science or any claims that affect the introduction or use of the vaccine  are evaluated and presented independently. All three of these kinds of  protection require investment from the government, which should emphasise that  the activities related to them are necessary and complementary to immunisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are individuals and groups who argue against vaccines,  who believe that the decrease in the incidence of several infectious diseases  is a result of improvements in sanitation and hygiene, living conditions and  nutrition. While such improvements have clearly contributed to the decline of  some diseases, such as tuberculosis and cholera in the industrialised  countries, the remarkable decrease in the incidence of measles, <em>Haemophilus  influenzae</em>-associated meningitis and more recently, rotavirus  gastroenteritis in these same countries has been too rapid to be attributable  to anything other than vaccines <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Strebel PM, Cochi SL, Hoekstra E, Rota PA, Featherstone D, Bellini WJ, Katz SL. A world without measles. J Infect Dis. 2011 Jul;204 (Suppl 1):S1&ndash;3." id="7">(7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Slack MP, Azzopardi HJ, Hargreaves RM, Ramsay ME.

				</p>
				<p>
					Nonetheless, every intervention, whether preventive or  curative, requires a cautious approach. Vaccines are administered  prophylactically to protect healthy individuals against diseases to which they  are likely to be exposed. Clearly, the benefit offered by a vaccine must be  greater than any potential risk it poses, and this benefit and risk must be  evaluated at the level of the individual and the population separately. At the  level of the individual, parents seek information and make decisions on whether  their child should be given a vaccine, whether its administration should be  deferred or whether it should be avoided, thus taking the responsibility for  decisions that affect their child's health.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, at the population level, how should decisions  regarding benefit and risk be made and who should make them? If a disease is  common and devastating, and the vaccine is inexpensive, effective and safe with  no side-effects, then the decision should be easy enough to take. Again, it is  not difficult to take a decision if a disease is rare and non-fatal, or easily  curable or treatable, and if there is no safe and effective vaccine. However,  if there is no accurate knowledge of the disease burden (and this can be the  case for a number of reasons), or the vaccine is expensive or not effective  enough, then both issues (disease burden and cost-effectiveness) must be  studied carefully before taking a decision on the use of the vaccine. In recent  times, there has been tremendous pressure from some vaccine manufacturers for  the introduction of new vaccines, sometimes mis-presenting arguments as in the  case of the HPV vaccines, and this needs to be guarded against <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kang G. HPV vaccines: separating real hope from drug company hype. Indian J Med Ethics. 2010 Jan&ndash;Mar;7(1):56&ndash;7." id="10">(10)</a>. There are several advisory bodies, consisting  mostly of independent experts, at the country level as well as internationally,  that make recommendations and help governments to consider the evidence. In  addition, organisations such as WHO, through its Strategic Advisory Group of  Experts on immunisation, make recommendations on the introduction of vaccines  into public health programmes <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mantel C, Wang SA. The privilege and responsibility of having choices: decision-making for new vaccines in developing countries. Health Policy Plan. 2012 May;27 (Suppl 2):ii1&ndash;4." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before licensure, vaccines are expected to undergo phased  testing among an increasingly larger population. The safety and efficacy of a  vaccine are the determinants of licensure by the regulatory authorities. Once a  vaccine is licensed, considerations such as the disease burden it can avert,  its societal value in terms of equity, the public demand for it, politics and  programmatic considerations determine whether it is finally seen as a public  health priority. However, concerns have been expressed regarding the safety of  several vaccines which have been introduced into national programmes. Two key  elements related to safety need to be recognised.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first is that no vaccine can claim to be 100% safe. Since  most vaccines are developed to mimic infection, they result in some reaction,  which is usually mild. For example, there may be some redness and swelling  around the site of the injection or fever following the injection. Rarely,  however, serious adverse events may occur in the case of some vaccines. Some  examples are the occurrence of intussusception in 1 in 20,000&ndash;60,000 recipients  of the oral rotavirus vaccine, anaphylaxis in 1 in 1000,000 recipients of the  hepatitis B vaccine and encephalitis following the mumps vaccine. The WHO has  published the expected rate of adverse events for several vaccines <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. WHO vaccine reaction rates information sheets [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2013 [cited 2013 Aug 14]. Available from: http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/vaccinfosheets/en/index.html." id="12">(12)</a>, and  these can be useful when deciding upon whether or not the risk of a vaccine is  acceptable, compared to the vaccine's potential benefit, at the population  level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second concern is that  careful and constant monitoring is required for the continual evaluation of  safety signals, which may have previously gone undetected or appear because of  a change in the composition or administration of the vaccine. For example, it  is now recognised that narcolepsy may follow immunisation with a swine flu  pandemic vaccine in individuals with a specific HLA type DQB1*06:02 in northern  Europe. It was initially difficult to make a causal association with the  vaccine, but following thorough studies in several countries that evaluated  large databases, a risk of 1 in 52,000 doses was assigned <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Miller E, Andrews N, Stellitano L, Stowe J, Winstone AM, Shneerson J, Verity C. Risk of narcolepsy in children and young people receiving AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine: retrospective analysis. BMJ. 2013 Feb 26;346:f794." id="13">(13)</a>. An example of a  change in composition resulting in safety issues is the occurrence of cases of  aseptic meningitis when the Urabe strain of mumps virus replaced the Jeryl Lynn  strain <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Miller E, Goldacre M, Pugh S, Colville A, Farrington P, Flower A, Nash J, MacFarlane L, Tettmar R. Risk of aseptic meningitis after measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in UK children. Lancet. 1993 Apr 17;341(8851):979&ndash;82." id="14">(14)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many instances  in which the potential dangers of a vaccine have been identified and  appropriate action has been taken. In all these cases, a biologically valid  explanation for an event was found and an estimation of the risk made on the  basis of comprehensive investigations. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.  All too often, events that are related in time to the vaccination events are  considered the cause of an adverse event, and no attention is paid to the  possibility of whether the supposed association can be explained biologically  and from the evidence available. For example, given the infant mortality rate  in India, approximately 300 children would be expected to die during any  24-hour period. If the child happened to receive a vaccine on that day, it may  be wrong to conclude that the vaccine caused the death, without gathering  further information on the circumstances and sequence of events. Did the  vaccine really cause the death? How can this causality be determined?
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO has come up with a tool  that can serve as a guide in the assessment of causality. The approach adopted  lays emphasis on constructing and testing a biologically plausible hypothesis  to support the association <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Causality assessment of adverse event following immunization (AEFI): user manual for the revised WHO classification WHO/HIS/EMP/QSS 2013[Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2013 Mar [cited 2013 Aug 14]. Available from: http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/publications/aevi_manual.pdf." id="15">(15)</a>. However, it must be pointed out that for the  assessment of causality to be satisfactory and for it to be able to provide a clear  message regarding safety, it is critical that a stable, comprehensive and  structured Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) reporting system is  functional, capable of providing detailed data on each event. When clear data  pointing to a safety concern are supported by epidemiological and laboratory  evidence, a causal association is indicated and the risks and benefits of  vaccination must be re-assessed.
				</p>
				<p>
					One example of the application of this tool has been the  recent developments related to the pentavalent vaccine. This vaccine contains  five antigens that have been used in different combinations in millions of  children around the world. As for the combination used in developing countries,  it has been deployed in countries with birth cohorts of several million  children, and some countries in Asia have reported safety signals, with  children dying shortly after the administration of the vaccine. Sri Lanka,  India, Bhutan and Viet Nam have all reported and investigated serious adverse  events following immunisation with this vaccine. Each case was investigated by  the national programmes in collaboration with WHO, using the criteria on the  assessment of causality developed by WHO. These criteria err on the side of  abundant caution, in not saying that there is no association unless a clear  alternative cause is found. It was determined that there was no causal  association. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety posted a report of  the discussion on its website <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="WHO. Statement of the Global Advisory Committee on vaccine safety on AEFI related to pentavalent vaccine (DPT Hib Hep B) use in Asia [Internet]. Geneva: WHO; 2013 JunA [cited 2013 Aug 15]. Available from: http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/pentavalent3.pdf." id="16">(16)</a>. Fortunately, countries have made a re-assessment  and decided to continue with the pentavalent vaccine or re-introduced it into  their national programmes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The pentavalent vaccine will  need continued monitoring, but there is currently no peer-reviewed scientific  report based on analysis of a complete data set in a quality journal to support  a causal association. Unfortunately, not everyone who has to make a decision  regarding vaccines reads the scientific literature. The notorious case of  Andrew Wakefield is worth mentioning in this context, and it must be noted that  it was a flawed peer review process and the media, which thrives on  demonisation, that allowed him to get away with a fraudulent research paper. In  his paper, Wakefield claimed that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could  cause autism. The claim and data were flawed and there was clearly no causal  association. The findings were disproved over and over again, but the damage  done to public health is reflected in an ongoing outbreak of measles in Wales <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Greaves F, Donaldson L. Measles in the UK: a test of public health competency in a crisis. BMJ. 2013 May1;346:f2793." id="17">(17)</a>. Measles is not usually life-threatening in Wales, but a similar scare  regarding vaccines has the potential to endanger lives in a developing country.  There were scares following the circulation of stories that the polio vaccine  causes sterility, that the measles vaccine virus results in autism and that the  thiomersal in vaccines causes cerebral palsy or autism. None of these notions  has stood the test of a causality assessment <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Parker SK, Schwartz B, Todd J, Pickering LK. Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data.

Vaccine. 2001 Mar 21; 19 (17&ndash;19): 2440&ndash;5." id="21">21)</a>, but that does not stop  individuals and organisations from continuing to make unproven claims. Spreading  this sort of panic can deprive children of the opportunity for vaccination. The  ill effects of this are bad enough in the developed countries, but in the case  of countries where access to healthcare is already limited, they result in a  further denial of equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, vaccines are  valuable for individuals and populations, and public health ethics requires  that we ensure access to all the appropriate vaccines for all our children so  that they are protected from disease. However, we also have an ethical  responsibility to see to it that the use of a vaccine is monitored through a  system that carefully assesses safety signals after the vaccine has been  licensed and introduced. The importance of an AEFI surveillance system to  promote safety, appropriately assess risk and prevent misinformation cannot be  over-emphasised. Finally, we have an ethical responsibility to employ the best  scientific tools available to evaluate and use whatever evidence has been  collected carefully (and not use selected information and cherry-picked data),  to direct decision-making so that programmes do not, without clear and  compelling evidence, withdraw vaccines. The withdrawal of vaccines without such  evaluation would have consequences for people who have few other opportunities  to prevent illness among their children.
