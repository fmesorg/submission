				<h4>Breaking bad news in the paediatric ICU: need for ethical practice</h4>
				<p>
					Communicating with the parents of children who are extremely sick or dying in the intensive care unit (ICU) is an extremely challenging  task. The physician in charge of intensive care, apart from administering the  routine medical treatment, has other vital roles to play, such as communicating  the poor prognosis, advising the guardians on decisions regarding the  withdrawal of life support, requesting permission for an autopsy and initiating  the process of organ donation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meert KL, Eggly S, Pollack M, Anand KJ, Zimmerman J,  Carcillo J, Newth CJ, Dean JM, Willson DF, Nicholson C; National Institute of  Child Health and Human Development Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care  Research Network. Parents' perspectives regarding a physician-parent conference  after their child's death in the pediatric intensive care unit. J  Pediatr. 2007;151(1):50-5, 55.e1-2." id="1">(1)</a>. Intensivists play the unique role of helping  parents prepare for the child's death and ushering in the grief process which  will help the family remain functional and intact. Allowing parents to play an  active role in management decisions and informing them about the patient's  condition at every stage of treatment can build their trust and help them  prepare to face worse situations.

					The manner in which the bad news is discussed is extremely important to most parents and a casual approach can seriously add to their  mental agony <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meert KL, Eggly  S, Pollack M, Anand KJS, Zimmerman J, Carcillo J, Newth CJL, Dean JM, Willson  DF, Nicholson C; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network. Parents' perspectives  on physician-parent communication near the time of a child's death in the  pediatric intensive care unit. Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2008;9(1):2-7." id="2">(2)</a>. Unlike in the West, the parents' emotions and bereavement  following their child's death are often overlooked in India, the more so in  government hospitals. Lack of empathy, crowded hospitals, overworked doctors  and understaffed ICUs could be responsible for this, but these factors are  certainly not justifiable.

					Informing  parents about their child's death is probably the most difficult job even for  an experienced paediatrician. This delicate matter is dealt with mostly by  residents and junior faculty members (rather than consultants in charge of the  child), who spend more time with the patients, especially "out of hours." It is  often assumed that residents are good at communication, though studies have  shown that most physicians are not good at communicating bad news to parents <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Seth T.  Communication to pediatric cancer patients and their families: a cultural  perspective. Indian J Palliat Care. 2010;16(1):26-9." id="3">(3)</a>. The problem becomes more acute if they do not know the language spoken by  the parents. The common errors committed are making a brief, rapid declaration,  not answering the parents' queries and not spending enough time with the  parents. Such approaches can send out wrong signals, such as leading the  parents to suspect that there has been a "cover up." They can worsen the  parents' anxiety, make it difficult for them to accept the news, complicate the  subsequent bereavement process and even result in litigation <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Finlay I,  Dallimore D. Your child is dead. BMJ. 1991;302(6791):1524-5." id="4">(4)</a>. Parents want  empathetic, honest and complete information, communicated in lay language and  at a pace that is easy to comprehend. Hiding true facts regarding the disease  or prognosis from the parents can lead to false hopes and feelings of fury,  betrayal and distrust <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Meert KL, Eggly  S, Pollack M, Anand KJS, Zimmerman J, Carcillo J, Newth CJL, Dean JM, Willson  DF, Nicholson C; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network.

					Discussing donation of the child's organs has been found to have a positive effect on bereaved parents and can help them cope with the bad  news <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Finlay I,  Dallimore D. Your child is dead. BMJ. 1991;302(6791):1524-5." id="4">(4)</a>. On the other hand, it can also be a double-edged sword as parents  sometimes perceive it as an opportunistic act and a sign of complete lack of  sensitivity on the part of the doctor. However, if the subject is handled with  sensitivity, the parents may derive solace from the prospect that their child's  organs will continue to live and this can help them cope with the traumatic  event. The personal belongings of the dead child, however trivial they may be,  are extremely important to the parents. Be it a dress, hair clip or toy, the  staff should take care to return it to the parents. A study on bereaved parents  showed that nearly all of them wished to spend some time with their dead child,  even if the body was mutilated <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Finlay I,  Dallimore D. Your child is dead. BMJ. 1991;302(6791):1524-5." id="4">(4)</a>.

					The junior doctors should be sensitised to this serious issue and must be trained adequately to deal with the bereavement of parents. The  assessment of communication skills in simulated encounters with parents and  feedback from senior faculty members can improve the doctors' ability to  counsel and break bad news to parents. Such an exercise has been found to  improve the parents' level of trust and make junior doctors feel more confident <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Greenberg LW,  Ochsenschlager D, O'Donnell R, Mastruserio J, Cohen GJ. Communicating bad news: a pediatric department's evaluation of a simulated intervention. Pediatrics. 1999;103 (6 Pt 1):1210-17." id="5">(5)</a>. Training of a similar nature should be incorporated into the postgraduate  curriculum.
				</p>
				<p>
					Being  empathetic, using the right words, speaking in a clear and unhurried manner,  making sure that one's look and body language convey concern, choosing a  private area for discussion and giving the parents enough time are all factors  that are vital to the task of breaking the bad news with sensitivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					If  the doctor handles the subject of a child's death in an ethical manner, it  makes a huge difference to the parents. Even from the doctors' perspective,  this approach is associated with personal satisfaction and a sense of  fulfilment, once one goes beyond the blow of losing the patient. The content of  our medical textbooks and curriculum is inadequate with respect to the skills  needed for the ethical management of death <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Billings JA, Block S. Palliative care in undergraduate  medical education: status report and future directions. JAMA. 1997;278:733-8." id="6">(6)</a>. Due to the lack of formal  training in this area, it is up to the physicians to develop their own skills  and this largely comes with experience. It is worth remembering the two  important prerequisites of the successful management of death - empathy for the  parents and sensitivity to their feelings.
