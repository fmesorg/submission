				<h4>Medical ethics: patients and relatives</h4>
				<p>
					Medical ethics merits continued debate throughant the lifetimes of doctors, patients and their relatives. Sometimes this results in acrimony, throwing more heat than light on the subject. As of today, ethics are practised more in their breach than in their observance. Just as it is with sincerity, ethics cannot really be taught. Both must come from within.
				</p>
				<p>
					Life is constantly changing and so do medical ethics. After all, medical ethics and the medical profession as a wbole are mere reflections of society at large. In India, we are not permitted to advertise ourselves. even so, we continue to do so on the sl and, in some cases, through whispers and whimpers.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would like to quote a personally experienced ethical dilemma. Two decades or so ago, a senior gynaecologist, approximately of my age and standing, had discussed one of her indoor patients with me. We happened to be attached to the same institution. Subsequently, she went on leave, deputing me as her locum tenens. The next day, I first saw my own patients and then those being attended to by her. Her patient then asked me, <em>"Does a patient have the right to change her doctor?"</em> It was obvious that she was referring to her own specific case and implied that she wished me to look after her care for good. How was I to resolve the dilemma ethically? After some thought, I told her, "The patient has an absolute right to change your doctor. But then the patient must consider the fact that her current doctor, who has treated her for years, knows all about her illnesses and understands her system. A new doctor would be ignorant ,of several details.
				</p>

				<p>
					Hence, if the patient has faith in her original doctor, it would be wise for her to continue to seek her help." She got the point and continued with her original consultant.
