				<h4>Don't use great people to sell your drug</h4>
				<p>
					There are various methods by which physicians can be influenced by pharmaceutical companies: through drug representatives, free lunches, industry-sponsored trips to exotic locations, gifts, research funds, free conference registration, consulting fees for participation as a guest speaker, financing publication of research articles, etc. Various studies conducted on the influence of these marketing strategies on physicians' drug prescribing behaviour suggest that physicians are influenced by these strategies <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wazana A. Physicians and the pharmaceutical industry: Is a gift ever just a gift? JAMA. 2000; 283: 373-80." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					One important method by which drug companies influence physicians' prescribing practices is by giving them their promotional literature. In India, medical representatives distribute such promotional literature to physicians during their visits. It is observed that information given in such literature is often incorrect and biased <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mansfield PR, Henry D. Misleading drug promotion--no sign of improvements. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2004 Nov;13(11):797-9." id="2">(2)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sometimes the influence is more subtle. One example is drug promotional material for an atypical antipsychotic, brand name Amival (Amisulpride). On the front of the leaflet the drug's brand name is written in bold, below which the generic name is given in very small letters. This is followed by the indications for its use: "For the positive and negative of schizophrenia". "For the positive and" is written in black on a white background; "negative of schizophrenia" is written in white against a black background. The dosage, other therapeutic claims and references are also printed on the front.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the back of the pamphlet there is a picture of the American civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Below his picture, his positive qualities are given: his 1963 march on Washington, his Nobel Peace Prize, and his efforts to end poverty and the Vietnam War. This is given in black against a white background. His suicide attempt at the age of 12, his irregular schooling and allegations that he plagiarised some of his academic work are mentioned, in white against a black background.
				</p>
				<p>
					What message does the pharmaceutical company want to give physicians who read this pamphlet? Is the drug company trying to create an association between Dr King and the condition for which the drug is promoted?
				</p>
				<p>
					I appeal to the company to withdraw this pamphlet. It is unethical to use a great person like Martin Luther King to sell drugs.
