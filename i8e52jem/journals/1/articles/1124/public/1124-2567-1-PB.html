					There is a conflict between the obligations of a physician-investigator to  deliver optimal care to his patients now and to advance scientific knowledge so  that optimal care can be delivered in the future. The author discusses how  these conflicts can be resolved.

					Did bioethics begin in the USA and then spread around the world, or did  bioethics exist throughout the ages in every region? The author says this  varies with the definition of bioethics and proposes to conduct a comparative  study of the history of bioethics among countries or regions. He requests  information from readers at Masahiro Morioka (<a href="mailto:mail@lifestudies.org">mail@lifestudies.org</a>)

					Ethics committees are  presumably staffed by competent people and decisions are taken after proper  discussion. But how accountable are they to the public? Should ethics  committee members be free to reveal meeting discussions to the public? The  writer suggests that by making the discussions public, the committee is  accountable to the public and it lead to transparency and accountability.

					Doctors are gradually becoming used to discussing physician stress. Unhappy,  tense, tired, or anxious doctors do not provide quality care. Handling errors  sensibly, making simple changes to the way work is organised, and counselling  are critical for stress reduction.

				<h4>Health  Policy</h4>
				<p>
					Confidentiality has always been an essential element in medical consultation.  Privacy, however, is not an absolute right and has to be balanced against the  rights of others or societal groups. The new NHS code attempts to strike a  compromise between these views.

					China has a mandatory form of screening (detailed questionnaire, complete physical  examination and blood tests) for fitness to wed and reproduce. Its main purpose  is to screen for hereditary illness and conditions that may jeopardise  parenting abilities, such as psychiatric problems. Its public health benefits  include diagnosis and treatment of unrecognised diseases, reduced transmission  of disease to partners and offspring, a forum for health education, and a  convenient means of collecting information on the health of the population for  epidemiological and planning purposes. However, it undermines the fundamental  human right to marry and reproduce and has potential for oppression and eugenic  misuse.

					The role of race in the cause and treatment of disease has been abused in the  past and may lead to abuse in the future. But it is only by recording race that  racially-biased health policy and practices may be uncovered. The author  discusses these different points of view expressed in two articles in the same  issue of the journal.

					The South African government restricted the use of the drug nevirapine that  reduces the transmission of HIV from mother to infants. NGOs challenged this in  court which ruled recently that everyone has the right to have access to (a)  healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare, and (b) the state must  take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources,  to achieve the progressive realization of each of these rights. The author  discusses the right to health ruling and its ramifications.

					Sex selection in India went high-tech with the use of the latest in vitro  fertilisation (IVF) to choose the embryo of the 'desired' sex. Some doctors  have launched campaigns for the couple's right to choose, claiming that sex  selection will have no unwanted social consequences. This article outlines the  ethical arguments against preconceptual sex selection.

					Why are staff in the public sector rude to poor patients, demand bribes and  sell free samples? The author argues that such practices are some of the many  coping mechanisms-some of which are 'predatory'-that staff develop when poorly  paid, unmotivated and in poor working conditions. The solution does  not lie in banning staff from private practice as there is little scope for  increase in salary, and improving the working environment is important but not  enough. 'Improvement of working conditions...also means developing career  prospects and providing perspectives for training...most importantly, it  requires professional behaviour free from the clientelism and arbitrariness  prevalent in the public sector .'

				<h4>Education</h4>
				<p>
					A new interactive  case-based series explores what 'ordinary' cases can teach about options for  management, and how to communicate with patients and their relatives. Readers, including  patients, are asked to post their views on the website. Part of the learning  value for doctors is likely to come from examining the diversity of the  responses.

					To improve the quality of care, patients must be encouraged to participate in  treatment decisions.

					To assess their ethical development, the authors administered a questionnaire  to medical students and found a significant decline in this attribute over  time. They wonder if 'a hidden curriculum' in medical education inhibits the  development of moral reasoning.

					The author ponders on ways to strengthen physicians' ethical  behaviour-administering a test on moral judgement to entering students;  providing effective ethics training during medical school and residency  training; evaluation of performance in ethics. He concludes that 'Most  fundamentally, what is needed is the habit of mind of adopting and valuing the  patient's perspective on unfolding medical events and creating a shared medical  experience with the patient.'
