				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Multiple research guidelines address the issue of standard of care
					in international collaborative research. These guidelines fail to
					appreciate that differing standards may be present within the same
					country, which makes their application sometimes impracticable. In
					circumstances where ethics review committees follow one of these
					guidelines entirely and to the hilt, some relevant and useful research
					is rejected while the way for "me too" drug trials is paved. It should
					be acceptable to hold different researchers to separate standards of
					care on the basis of their intentions, their financial resources, their
					ultimate gains from the research, and subsequent utilisation of the
					results of the research, even when these researchers come from the
					same country where the research is being conducted.

					<strong>Key words:</strong> standard of care, research ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should a universal standard of care be adhered to in all types
					of research conducted anywhere in the world? This is an
					excessively debated question in research ethics <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Angell M.

					the subsequent utilisation of the results of the research must
					be given due consideration while deciding on the standard
					of care. If all these factors are considered diligently, it seems
					only reasonable to allow different standards of care within the
					same country in different settings; it is inappropriate to compel
					researchers to provide the best care available anywhere in
					the world, especially where they are not being supported by
					sponsors.

				<h4>Case 1</h4>
				<p>
					Dr K is a family physician working in a basic health unit of a
					small rural community in Pakistan. During his clinical practice,
					he observes that children under the age of five are suffering
					from a typhoid fever that is resistant to the locally available
					drugs. He designs a small randomised control trial to determine
					whether a combination of more than one of these drugs is
					effective. His study design employs the available single-dose
					regimen for the control group. The best proven treatment for
					typhoid fever, intravenous third-generation antibiotics, is not
					available in his hospital and he has no resources to provide for
					them. The research ethics board rejects the proposal, as the best
					proven treatment is not being compared to the studied drug
					combination.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Case 2</h4>
				<p>
					A national pharmaceutical company in Pakistan has developed
					a newer type of insulin, Insulin-D, to treat Insulin Dependent
					Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM). This company intends to start a
					large scale phase-III trial in a local rural community with a high
					prevalence of IDDM. A renowned researcher from a nearby city
					is selected to conduct the trial. The study design employs the
					locally available standard of care for the control group. This is
					Insulin-B, that has lately been ineffective to manage blood
					sugar levels. The research ethics board asks the research team to
					modify the study design and provide the best proven therapy,
					Insulin-C, to the control group. The primary investigator changes
					the protocol accordingly and assures the availability of Insulin-
					C for both the control and study groups for one month after
					completion of this project. The sponsors declare a hefty budget
					for the overheads besides the trial expenses. They agree to
					market the study drug in the community (if it proves effective)
					but refuse to make it available free of cost for more than a
					month after the research is finished. In addition, they cannot
					guarantee that the drug, when marketed, will be available
					at a cost affordable to the community. However, they offer to
					compensate the community by building a clinic in the village.
					The proposal gets approved.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					On the surface, the decisions of the research ethics boards
					look genuine. In the first instance, the study protocol was not
					approved, as the researcher was not offering the best proven
					therapy for the control group though it is available in the
					country. The second was approved when the researcher agreed
					to use the best proven treatment. Let us analyse them in detail.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intention of Dr K in the first case is to cure a treatable
					disease when the causative organism has developed resistance
					to the available therapy. His goal is to provide the community
					with a desperately needed drug, without extra cost. He is using
					the patients as a means to an end, but not merely as means.
					The pharmaceutical company, on the other hand, is using these
					patients only as the means. Though the research participants
					need insulin, they will not have access to it after the conclusion
					of the trial. The company has no intention of providing the
					patients or their community with either Insulin-D or the
					best proven therapy, Insulin-C. This trial should preferably beconducted in a sub-group of private sector patients where the
					drug will be marketed in view of the fact that justice requires an
					equitable distribution of harms and benefits <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Beauchamp TL, Childress JF. Principles of Biomedical Ethics. 5th ed. New York: Oxford University Press; 2001. p 226." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr K does not have the financial resources to provide for thirdgeneration
					antibiotics to the control group. As a result, his
					choices are limited to either using the best locally available
					treatment or giving up the idea altogether. If he is forced to
					give up this study, the best interests of the community are
					not being served. The pharmaceutical company, on the other
					hand, has declared a hefty overhead budget. Provision of the
					best proven treatment is merely a procedural issue for them.
					Researchers in non-industrialised countries commonly insist
					on providing the best locally available standard of care, arguing
					that it is not practicable to sustain the best proven treatment <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhutta ZA. Why regulate? The need for national guidelines for ethical regulation of research. J Coll Physicians Surg Pak 2001; 9: 537-540." id="6">(6)</a>.
					Those conducting trials of "me too" drugs with huge marketing
					potentials should be held to the highest ethical standards with
					the proviso that they must sustain this standard for as long as
					the research participants require it.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no possibility of Dr K making personal financial gains
					from the study he proposes. On the other hand, the
					pharmaceutical company is conducting this trial only for
					financial gain. It is willing to provide Insulin-C to trial participants
					for a month after the study is completed, but do not feel
					responsible for their remaining life span. Since Insulin Dependent
					Diabetes Mellitus necessitates life-long use of insulin, these
					patients will have to revert to the ineffective Insulin-B after a
					month. The pharmaceutical company is making a clinic for the
					community. But there are many instances of such infrastructure
					ending up as a burden to the local community which is unable
					to meet exorbitant recurring expenses <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Varatharajan, Thankappan R, Jayapalan S. Assessing the performance of primary health centers under decentralized government in Kerala, India. Health Policy Plan 2004; 19: 41-51." id="7">(7</a>, <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bureau of Program and Policy Coordination: US Agency for International Development. USAID policy paper recurrent cost: Problems in less developed countries. 1982 [Online] [Cited 2004 April 3]. Available from: http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/rec_cost/recurcst.doc." id="8">8)</a>. The fate of the
					building that is being offered is not likely to be different.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trial by Dr K has potential benefits for the participating
					community on a long-term basis. In contrast, the trial by
					the drug company has no long-term benefit for the local
					community. Researchers conducting non-beneficial research
					for participating communities tend to provide alternative, onetime
					compensations. Any dealings with the research subjects
					should be above and beyond these financial incentives. If a
					decision is made to accept these arrangements, each research
					subject should be clearly informed that he or she will be eligible
					for the new insulin free of cost only for a month after the trial;
					they will get a clinic for the community instead. These incentives
					may compensate for the lack of long-term availability of the new
					drug for the whole community. But they should not be seen as
					an alternative to a sustainable standard of care for research
					subjects with chronic diseases.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Conditions of uniform standards of care are emphasised in all
					international ethical guidelines. Application of this uniform
					standard is good for accountability but sometimes it is an
					obstacle to relevant, essential research. It may also facilitate "me
					too" drug trials. Ethics review committees should take these
					guidelines for what they are &ndash; only guidelines. Medicine is a
					dynamic, ever changing field. Generalisation and application
					of universal frameworks to all situations is neither practical nor
					in the best interest of patients. The two cases cited above may
					look similar on the surface and may have been conducted in the
					same community, but their implications for the participants are
					very different. It is only fair to respond to these differences in
					different ways.
