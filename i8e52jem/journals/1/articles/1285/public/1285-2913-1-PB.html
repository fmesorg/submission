					The aim of this first  review of the Research Ethics Committee at the Nelson R Mandela School of  Medicine, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is to provide insight into its  structure, composition, procedures and workload, and to assess its strengths  and weaknesses.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Nelson R Mandela  School of Medicine, University of Natal, is the only medical school in the  province of KwaZulu-Natal, which has a population of 10.5 million. For  more than two decades after its inception in 1950, it was the only tertiary  institution in South Africa providing medical training for black (African,  Indian and Coloured) students.
				</p>
				<p>
					KwaZulu-Natal is the  epicentre of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The antenatal prevalence of HIV was 32.5%  in 1999. Other prevalent diseases are tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition and  several malignancies such as that of the cervix and the oesophagus. Health care  in South Africa is provided by both the private and public sector. People using  the private sector generally have access to privately funded medical aid  schemes, and tend to have diseases patterns resembling those found in the  western world. The public sector is utilised by the majority of the population  with a wide spectrum of disease including those seen in developing countries.  Thus researchers in South Africa have a unique opportunity to investigate  diseases of both developed countries and the developing world.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1974 the Faculty of  Medicine established an Ethical and Standards Sub-Committee. Its functions  were: to review all research projects to ensure that they do not conflict with  ethical principles on research involving human beings; to review at any time  matters involving the care of patients in associated hospitals; to review from  time to time the instructions given to students on ethics of medical practice,  and to obtain, from the Medical Council, reports on any transgressions by its  graduates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the years a  dedicated committee managed the faculty's research and ethical matters. More  recently the job was entrusted to the ethics sub-committee of the Post-graduate  Committee. In view of a growing workload, it was decided to separate the ethics  sub-committee from the Post-graduate Committee. In 2000, the ethics committee  was renamed the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and currently serves to provide  an ethical review of research by the staff and students at the university, and  also by other researchers within the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

				<h4>Methods and findings</h4>
				<p>
					A retrospective analysis  of all applications submitted to the REC during the years 1997 to 1999 was  undertaken. Demographic details of the committee members were obtained  anonymously from the human resource office. The REC granted ethical approval  for the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Composition</em></strong> The REC is composed of 23 members, 15 of whom were elected and 5  co-opted. A registrar representative also serves on the committee. The Dean and  Deputy Registrar of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Natal are <em>ex-officio</em> members. Seventeen of the 23 members were male. As for a racial  breakdown, 12 of the members were Indian, 9 white and 2 were African. No  African females serve on the committee. The average age of the members of the  REC is 50 with a range of 26-66 years. An administrative officer and a  committee clerk assist in management of the committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					Members of the REC are  from the administration and various branches of medicine, as well as the social  sciences. Only two are in private practice; the rest range in seniority from  professor to lecturer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Functioning</em></strong> Monthly meetings are scheduled in advance and minutes of the  meetings are taken. Quorum requirements are 50% of elected members. All members  receive an agenda, and 16 members review protocols. These comments are referred  to the chairman or vice-chairman who reviews and summarises them before sending  them to the investigator to respond within a month. The amended protocol  together with the original is then returned to the original reviewer for final  approval or comment. All approved protocols are signed by the Dean, and  submitted to a full sitting of the REC for ratification. At the meeting  the submitted protocols may be ratified, rejected or approved conditional to  modifications as recommended by the REC. An expedited review process is also  available for protocols where ethical approval is required for funding  purposes. These protocols are sent to three senior members of the REC for  comment/approval.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Workload</em></strong> The  committee reviewed 200, 168 and 170 protocols during 1997, 1998 and 1999  respectively. The number of studies that were closed, cancelled or withdrawn  were 24, 17 and 20, respectively. Only one study was not approved during the  three-year period; the use of a placebo arm in symptomatic patients was deemed  to be unethical in this study as proven effective therapy was available for use  in the control group. The average turnaround time for processing a  research protocol was 96 days.?
				</p>
				<p>
					Protocols received by  the REC included all studies on human subjects. These fall into four main  categories: retrospective studies, faculty-sponsored research, sponsored trials  and studies for higher degrees. More than 90% of protocols submitted for the  first time were sent back for amendments or additional information. Reasons  for this include: the patient information sheet had either inadequate  information or was not written in lay terms; the protocols contained  contradictory information; for example there were conflicting age groups within  the protocol; consent of the head of department and signatures of all stated  role players were not attached; there were 'statistical problems' such as  inadequate sample size, ill-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria, or the  hypothesis or aims of study were poorly formulated
				</p>
				<p>
					Research involving  'vulnerable groups' such as prisoners, children, psychiatric patients and  patients in intensive care units raised most discussions and lengthy back and  forth exchanges between the REC and researchers. From 1997 to 1999, 43 (of 200  altogether that year), 31 (168) and 40 (170) respectively of all protocols  submitted for review, formed part of submissions for higher degrees.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Finances</em></strong>The  salaries of the administrative officer and committee clerk as well as other  incidental expenses such as communication, photocopying and other operating  expenses is borne by the University of Natal. The REC members are not paid for  their services. For sponsored drug trials a one-off fee of R2500 (approximately  US$ 350) for processing the protocol (irrespective of outcome) is charged.  Trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies numbered 50, 43 and 52 for the  period 1997 to 1999, respectively. This income was utilised for equipment and  furniture for the REC office as well as upgrading computer network facilities  for post-graduate students.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					A number of interesting  features arose in this review. The composition of the REC is not representative  of the demography of the region. Less than 10% of the committee members  are African, with no African females currently serving on the committee. Furthermore,  the absence of a statistician/epidemiologist, and of representatives from  consumer groups and faith-based organisations is a weakness. To this end we  have initiated a programme to recruit members from the above groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second major problem  area regarding the REC is related to monitoring of research. Active monitoring  is currently not undertaken by the REC, and this may lead researchers to become  complacent about informed consent, appropriate documentation and adhering to  the tenets of good research ethics. To address this problem the REC plans to  initiate an audit process, which would randomly look at 10% of the studies  undertaken. At present, researchers are required to supply the REC with  bi-annual progress reports, but this feedback is not monitored and depends on  the integrity of the researcher. Mechanisms to deal with conflicts between  mentor and trainee researcher are currently not in place and the REC only  becomes involved with the dispute if a written complaint is received.
				</p>
				<p>
					The validity of informed  consent is of grave concern to ethicists, especially in the multi-cultural  context of South Africa. There is a subjective impression that researchers lack  gender, cultural and religious sensitivities, which may lead to human rights  abuse and/or coercion of patients to participate in studies. The free  participation of subjects is also in dispute when it comes to therapeutic  trials involving treatment not offered by the public health system. A good  example of this is participation in anti-retroviral trials by HIV-positive  patients who know that they would receive little or no treatment in state  hospitals as opposed to a chance of receiving a placebo or trial drug. In  addition the clinical monitoring of drug trial participants is at a much higher  level than the "usual standard of care" in state hospitals. In therapeutic  trials, the principal researcher is paid according to the number of patients  enrolled, which may lead to fiscally-driven recruitment.
				</p>
				<p>
					A frequent criticism of  the REC is the long delay between submission of protocols and final approval.  There are several reasons for this, including: the poor quality of protocols  submitted; investigators' delays in responding to queries, and inappropriate  responses to queries; delays in obtaining translation of the patient  information into Zulu by the investigators; and delays in obtaining replies  from REC members.
				</p>
				<p>
					One possible  justification for the long turnaround time is the onerous workload on REC  members, which discourages people from serving on the REC. It is difficult to  attract persons to take on the task of chairpersonship of the REC. Institutions  serious about research should place more resources in the REC, and also  consider remunerating its members.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently committee  members are not required to have formal training in bioethics. The first  Research Ethics Workshop was held in 2000, providing training for 16  participants. Partial sponsorship from the private sector helped defray the  cost of course notes and reference materials for participants. It is expected  that this workshop will become an annual event. It is anticipated that basic  knowledge of research ethics will become a mandatory requirement not only for  REC members but also for researchers involved with human subjects. The  educational function of the REC should include training in bioethics for  undergraduates and post-graduate students in a wide area of ethics including  the management of HIV patients, end-of-life decisions, and informed consent.  The REC can play a major role in continuing medical education in the field of  bioethics and medical law.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The REC at the Nelson R  Mandela School of Medicine at the University of Natal provides an important  service to both the community and researchers. However, to maintain its  standards in the light of an increasing workload and more stringent regulatory  and legal requirements, the REC must adopt a more professional business  approach, and appoint a director as well as extra staff members to streamline  its functioning and enable it to audit some of the research it approves.  Perceiving the REC as a toothless, rubber-stamping bureaucratic burden will  doom our faculty to mediocrity and cut off the research funding vital to  maintain our research and teaching status.
