				<h4>Apologies</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Learning to say sorry is hard for physicians anywhere,
					perhaps more so in the Indian culture where a physician
					has a God-like status. However, as the following articles
					point out, it is the right thing to do for several reasons.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Apologies have a potential for healing that is matched
					only by the difficulty most people have in offering them.
					Physicians face special challenges in this realm. They
					may feel shame, guilt and grief when their actions harm
					others, even if the fault is unclear. Ineffective communication
					is the single largest factor resulting in patient
					litigation. Good communication can avert or help end
					conflict, especially litigation.

				<h4>How to get your message straight</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The Indian media has been as guilty as others of writing
					stories that are incomplete and sensational, and rarely is
					there any follow up. Yet the popular media is the best way
					to disseminate medical information. Both media and
					medical staff can learn a lot from the article that follows.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Press coverage of health care is often sloppy and
					sensationalised. Doctors and researchers have good reasons
					to help journalists do their job well because the press could
					be a positive influence on the nation's thinking about
					health. Medical journalists translate complex messages,
					under deadline, into news that people can understand.
					Not surprisingly, the quality of media reports varies
					greatly. Doctors too bear responsibility for trying to get
					attention for their message rather than on getting their
					message right. The authors suggest improved ways for
					both reporters and medical staff to communicate.

				<h4>Media hype?</h4>

					<em>Do journalisrs' report distort research findings? These two papers examine this question.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though a reporter's words reach the public rather than scientists or clinicians, Bubela's study found that
					media reports are reasonably accurate in most instances.
					Cases of inaccuracy may be as much a product of the
					researcher's overenthusiasm as of error by the reporter.
					Press coverage may not exaggerate wildly or contain
					blatantly inaccurate statements, but may be in favour or
					against a subject. Scientists and journalists have
					conflicting responsibilities because while reporters need
					to gain newspaper space by dramatic statements, scientists
					prefer cautious, detailed, and balanced reporting. Condit
					suggests ways for medical staff to avoid errors.

				<h4>Doctors and research participants</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The attitudes of physicians in India are probably similar
					to that found in the following study done in Taiwan.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					This survey of physicians from academic and community
					medical centres studied their attitudes and awareness of
					human research participant protection (HRPP). Ninety
					per cent of the respondents had never heard of
					Institutional Review Boards, the Nuremberg Code, the
					Declaration of Helsinki, etc. Despite this, more than 78%
					of the respondents felt HRPP was important and over 59%
					wanted research participants to be well informed and
					give informed consent. Physicians reported that careful
					selection of patients was more important than fully
					informing research participants, obtaining informed
					consent or submitting a proposal for IRB review. This
					study suggests that the current system for HRPP in Taiwan
					may not adequately protect the safety and rights of human
					research subjects.

				<h4>Research on domestic violence</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Domestic violence affects all strata of Indian society.
					Research on this subject is to be encouraged so that we may
					understand the roots and eradicate it. This article reminds
					us of researchers' special obligations to the survivors.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					No matter what the form of research is, whether
					retrospective or involving face-to-face interviews with
					actual victims, there are certain basic ethical principles
					that investigators should follow. Safety, confidentiality
					and interviewer skills and training of research staff&mdash;in
					medical as well as social and legal assistance&mdash;are more
					important than in many other forms of research. The
					main ethical concerns related to researching violence
					against women are the potential to inadvertently cause
					distress, possibility of risk to respondents and preventing
					respondents from feeling that she is just a 'means' to an
					end, which is the study itself.

				<h4>Screening for communicable disease</h4>
				<p>
					The author says that the media and other groups are
					erroneously linking communicable disease control to
					immigration control and advocating stringent health
					measures that are unlikely to reduce tuberculosis or HIV
					infection in the UK and are also unethical.

				<h4>Regulating private health care</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The ills plaguing the Indian medical scene are also seen
					in countries such as Canada and the USA. The difference
					is that in the West stringent laws are enforced with stiff
					penalties for those that break them.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Independent health facilities (IHFs) are privately owned,
					for-profit entities that provide therapeutic and diagnostic
					services such as physiotherapy and laboratory testing.
					These operate both within and outside the public system.
					These facilities depend on physician referrals for patients
					and offer compensation (a kickback) consisting of cash
					payments for each referral, discounted office space or
					leases for medical equipment, or business loans at belowmarket
					rates. Kickbacks and self-referrals to IHFs owned
					by physicians can potentially distort clinical judgement.
					Professional regulatory bodies such as the provincial
					colleges of physicians and surgeons may have the greatest
					expertise in governing such conflicts of interest. Authors
					review existing laws in the various Canadian states and
					suggest ways to tighten them.

				<h4>Publicising study results</h4>
				<p>
					The disclosure of study findings to participants in
					research reflects the moral obligation of researchers. This
					is founded in the ethical principle of respect for human
					dignity, i.e. to avoid treating human participants as a
					means to an end. It has many potential benefits for participants and may have a direct impact on their quality
					of life. Disclosure of results may also benefit research as
					a whole by demonstrating its tangible benefits to the public
					and by engaging public enthusiasm and support for the
					principle of research. The authors examine ways in which
					disclosure of results can benefit or harm the recipient
					and propose ways in which researchers can accomplish
					this difficult task.

				<h4>Evidence, not intuition</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Evidence- based medicine has aroused a lot of controversy
					in the medical field. This issue of the Journal of Medical
					Ethics has several articles that discuss the pros and cons
					of this approach in the various branches of medicine.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Evidence-based medicine (EBM), a term introduced in
					1992, says that all medical action should rely on solid
					quantitative evidence based on the best of clinical
					epidemiological research and one should be cautious
					about actions that are only based on experience or
					extrapolation from basic science. The idea was proposed
					in 1830 by physicians belonging to 'Médecine
					d'Observation' in France who were reacting against a kind
					of medicine that would be considered 'nonsense' by
					today's scientific standards. It is not that EBM is the only
					scientific medicine and that all medicine practised before
					it was unscientific. EBM states that intuition and
					unsystematic clinical experience as well as a
					pathophysiological rationale are insufficient grounds for
					clinical decision-making. EBM challenges the paternalistic
					and authoritarian nature of much medical practice and
					helps increase awareness that, even when based on
					scientific methods, there is a selective and structural
					imbalance in the nature of the evidence that is available,
					because that evidence is skewed and biased toward
					therapeutic versus preventive interventions and toward
					simple pharmacological versus complex behavioural/
					social care.

				<h4>Clinicians and religion</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The following article addresses a topic that is rarely dealt
					with in health care. How does one deal with religion in
					the care of patients?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Giving touching examples of patients with incurable
					illnesses in his oncological practice, the author asks, 'How
					should doctors examine and engage religion in the lives
					of their patients and in their own lives as clinicians? Is
					there any place for God at the bedside during rounds?'
					Religious beliefs are not always positive or beneficial. In
					the modern era, religion and science are understood to be sharply divided, the two occupy different domains.
					Religion explores the nature of God and offers rituals for
					implementing God's will, whereas science eschews any
					such metaphysics and through experimentation unveils
					the workings of the material world. The author suggests
					that irrespective of one's religious beliefs, a physician
					should be aware of the spiritual beliefs of the patient so
					that these are taken into account when planning health
					care of the patient.

				<h4>Affordability of medicines</h4>
				<p>
					In October 2002, the Thai Central Intellectual Property
					and International Trade Court ruled that because
					pharmaceutical patents can lead to high prices and limit
					access to medicines, patients are injured by them and can
					challenge their legality. Bristol-Meyers Squibb appealed
					this ruling but withdrew it in January 2004. This ruling
					has great international implications for health and human
					rights confirming that patients&mdash;whose health and lives
					can depend on being able to afford a medicine&mdash;can be
					considered as damaged parties and therefore have legal
					standing to sue. The Thai court case was the outcome of
					a learning process and years of networking between
					different civil society actors who joined forces to protect
					and promote the right of access to treatment. This ruling
					has set an important precedent that essential drugs are
					not just another consumer product but a human right and
					that patients are injured by patents

				<h4>Doctors and the drug industry</h4>
				<p>
					This collection of articles discusses the industry's
					influence on health professionals. The first author argues
					that despite evidence to the contrary, doctors do not
					believe that they are influenced by the pharmaceutical
					industry. He suggests steps that doctors can take to
					minimise this influence. The second author discusses the
					responsibility of educators to protect students from the
					influence of drug companies. Finally, a medical student
					reports on the debate and activities within the National
					Council of the Australian Medical Students' Association.

				<h4>Voices of developing countries</h4>
				<p>
					<em>For many health professionals in this part of the world,
					medical ethics is mostly about problems related to poverty
					and inequity. This special issue of the journal Developing
					World Bioethics carries a collection of papers on the
					subject.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					The papers cover a range of subjects: infectious diseases
					which mostly affect the poor and raise special ethical
					issues; the need to include 'power relations' in bioethics
					and make it more relevant to 'real people's concerns';
					distribution of research resources; patents and access to
					drugs, and policy options to reduce inequalities in health.
					The book review examines'ethics, economics, and AIDS
					in Africa.'

				<h4>Whistle blowing</h4>
				<p>
					<em>When should a health professional speak to the public
					about perceived shortfalls in services?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					This editorial discusses the case of a New Zealand
					orthopaedic surgeon who told the press of a fall in hospital
					beds for acute care. He was censured for failing to go
					through the correct channels. A further question raised
					here is the doctor's right and duty&mdash;beyond caring for
					patients, to speaking out on their behalf. The medical
					profession's voice can 'represent an important check in
					the system where management is making decisions which
					may affect people's fundamental well-being and lives'.

				<h4>Ethics in emergency medicine</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Indian doctors hesitate to provide emergency care fearing
					that they will later be burdened with medicolegal red
					tape.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					This article summarises some legal decisions related to
					emergency medical care. For example, doctors must provide
					immediate life-saving treatment to injured victims brought
					to them. The state is bound to provide adequate medical
					facilities. In an emergency, doctors may provide appropriate
					treatment&mdash;with discretion on choice of treatment&mdash;even
					without the patient's consent. In an emergency, doctors have
					the right to treat some patients on priority as they see fit. In
					an emergency, the doctor's priority is to save life rather than
					meet legal obligations.
