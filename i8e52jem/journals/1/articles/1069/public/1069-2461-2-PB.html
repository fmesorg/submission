				</p>
				<p>

					The author describes the role of placebo and how the doctor's bedside manner can also have a good, "placebo", effect or a "nocebo", negative, effect. The reviewer says that "physicians have to care. We have to feel that what's going on between our patients and us is meaningful, worthwhile and actually works. We have to recognise as well that when we develop that unique patient-doctor bond, what we say and how we say it can be therapeutic in many ways."
