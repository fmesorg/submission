					Training abroad, especially in the developed Western
					hemisphere, is generally seen as a desirable adjunct to
					qualifications obtained in India. Dr Bernstein, who offers a
					fellowship in neurosurgery, identifies certain areas of concern
					<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Reference text comes here!" id="1">(1)</a>. For one, the training may be inappropriate in the country
					from which the candidate hails. Second, the candidate may be
					tempted to stay on in the developed West, and this would be a
					loss for the home country. Finally, the candidate may be abused
					by his supervisor. How relevant are these concerns in relation
					to India? To understand this we must first look at some of the
					characteristics of the Indian medical care system.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Medical care in India</h4>
				<p>
					A striking feature of the medical care system in India is the
					apparent lack of planning. There is no clear perspective
					on the medical care needs of the Indian population. The
					Shrivastav committee on medical manpower submitted its
					recommendations which were accepted in 1977, but these were
					never implemented and they are now out of date. In the recent
					past, the government has planned by default. In other words, by
					failure of regulation, it has permitted private interests in medical
					education to offer those courses which are considered to be â€˜in
					demand'. The courses that are in demand, as dictated by the
					market, are those which are most lucrative in the private sector.
					Thus we find that at present, radiology, orthopaedic surgery,
					cardiology and cardiac surgery are most sought after.
				</p>
				<p>
					the lack of scope for career planning for most doctors. This is
					a result of the absence of a systematic medical care system.
					The uneasy coexistence of a grossly under-funded, poorly
					equipped and overloaded public medical system, alongside a
					poorly regulated private medical system, has given rise to many
					unhealthy practices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most doctors, having completed their basic medical education,
					try to acquire a specialist qualification. Having acquired this
					qualification, they must choose one of two options. If they
					choose the public sector, there is a great likelihood that they
					may not be able to utilise their skills due to lack of infrastructure
					or deliberate hurdles by the medical bureaucracy. If they choose
					the private sector, they will have to compete for the limited
					number of patients who can pay for private care. In today's
					world, it is a fact that as the skills required increase, so too do the
					technology and cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore the reality in India today is that the government
					has not identified areas of shortage in medical manpower and offered incentives to doctors to acquire the required
					qualifications. When a doctor seeks a foreign fellowship, it is
					a personal decision and the fellowship is often obtained by
					strenuous personal effort. It is highly unlikely therefore; that a
					doctor will apply for a fellowship without an idea of what he/she
					is going to do with the skills obtained. We must remember that
					sometimes, the advantages are intangible. In India, the very fact
					that you have trained abroad adds prestige to your resume and
					this is reward enough for many.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The value of fellowships</h4>
				<p>
					So what does all this add up to? Regarding the problem of
					appropriate training, it means that, by and large, the candidates
					have reassured themselves on this. If they are in the public sector
					they will try to ensure that they get the requisite infrastructural
					support. If they are in the private sector, most probably they are
					attempting to get a skill that will give them an advantage in the
					marketplace of private medicine in India, a unique selling point.
					As one doctor told me with disarming candour, "We always have
					to learn something new to stay ahead."
				</p>
				<p>
					What about the so-called brain-drain? This may cause concern
					if there are large vacancies in the public medical system due
					to migration of doctors. In India, this is not the case. There are
					too many doctors applying for jobs in the public system. The
					vacancies that do exist are in places nobody wants to live
					in, a situation found throughout the world, even in the most
					developed countries. When a society &ndash; as represented by its
					government &ndash; is not interested in the skills that an individual
					possesses, I see no problem in the person using it where they
					are appreciated. In a larger sense, I think everyone should have
					a right to choose where he or she lives. Also, using your skills for
					the welfare of humankind is all that is required. Forcing a person
					to work in a particular country is a narrow kind of nationalism.
					Abuse by a supervisor is hardly important at this level. The
					fellows can simply quit if they find the situation intolerable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, fellowships are a wonderful way to acquire not only
					skills but friends and mentors. The exposure they afford to
					a different way of doing things, a different culture, a different
					people, is usually a tremendously positive influence. People like
					Dr Bernstein who take care to ensure that fellows from the less
					developed world are also selected are doing a lot for the welfare
					of humankind. May their tribe increase.
