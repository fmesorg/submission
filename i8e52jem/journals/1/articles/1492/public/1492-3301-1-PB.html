					A full-scale attack on the CIOMS Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki is currently underway.

					During  the Third Reich, Nazi doctors in German concentration camps conducted some of  the most gruesome medical experiments imaginable. The international community  responded to these and other crimes committed by medical researchers against  research subjects, with the Nuremberg Code, the first international normative  framework regulating the standards of clinical trials <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jonsen, AR, et al (Eds): Source book in bioethics. 1998. Georgetown UP, Washington: 11-12." id="1">(1)</a>. This document was  superseded in 1964 by the Declaration of Helsinki <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jonsen, AR et al. (Eds): op. cit.: 13-15" id="2">(2)</a>, a code for research and  experimentation issued by the World Medical Association (WMA), which despite  its partial dilution of the stringent ethics requirements set by the Nuremberg  Code eventually became the most influential international ethics document  regulating medical research. In 1993 the Declaration was supplemented by  international research ethics guidelines produced by the Council of  International Organisations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) in collaboration with  the World Health Organisation <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council of Medical Organisations of Medical Sciences: International ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects. CIOMS/ WHO: Geneva, 1993." id="3">(3)</a>. This set of documents provides essential  protection to research subjects in developing countries.

				<p>
					A full  scale attack on the CIOMS Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki is  currently underway. Much of this article will deal with the Declaration of  Helsinki. The reason for this is to do with the fact that the CIOMS  deliberations take place in complete secrecy. The proponents of changes to the  CIOMS research ethics guidelines are the same as those who push for changes to  the Declaration of Helsinki. However, Dr Bankowski, the long-serving CIOMS  Secretary General, refuses to provide any information about the proposed  changes, the group authoring the new CIOMS guidelines, or the process governing  the proceedings to change the guidelines, time lines or anything else related  to this issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					Considering  the international importance of the CIOMS guidelines, this is nothing short of  scandalous and wholly unacceptable. A new regime for the establishment of  international research ethics guidelines is called for, that doesn't rely on  anonymous, unaccountable organisations and experts that are chosen on the basis  of unknown criteria.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  number of international clinical research efforts have disregarded the  currently applicable international research ethics guidelines in vital  respects. More than once, researchers have been caught red-handed and often  red-faced by an alert international community of activists, concerned medical  professionals and bioethicists. Unfortunately, the powerful US bioethics  community's response has been to propose further dilutions of ethical standards  in research instead of improving the standards of research clinical trials  undertaken in developing countries. A US-based researcher, Henry Heimlich,  injected live malaria parasites into HIV-infected people in the People's  Republic of China after his research proposal was denied approval in the USA <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Heimlich, HJ et al: Malaria therapy for HIV patients. Mechanisms for ageing and development. 1997. 93: 79-85." id="4">(4)</a>. This contravened CIOMS guidelines requiring that western researchers in  developing countries provide clinical care meeting the standards of care in  their home country.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  recent clinical trials (supported by a UN agency, UNAIDS), an anti-retroviral  agent already known in western countries to reduce HIV transmission from  infected pregnant women to their foetuses was tested in developing countries &mdash;  and compared to a placebo. To no one's surprise, the number of HIV-infected  newborns was substantially lower in the group which received the active agent.  The women in the placebo group were knowingly subjected to a lower standard of  care <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sch&uuml;klenk, U: Unethical perinatal HIV transmission trials establish bad precedent. Bioethics 1998: 12: 312-319." id="5">(5)</a>. This violated the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS guidelines  requiring that research participants receive the best proven diagnostic and  therapeutic services. Though scientists and UNAIDS argued that a  placebo-controlled trial was needed to develop a cheaper drug regimen for  people in developing countries, a placebo control was unnecessary for this  purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  CIOMS Guidelines require that the results of research undertaken in developing  countries be made available (meaning affordable) to those communities in which  the research took place. Justice-related considerations require that those who  take on the burden of the research risks benefit from the results of their  risk-taking. The trial is said to have demonstrated that a lower dosage of the  drug in question worked to prevent HIV transmission from pregnant women to  their foetuses. However, this knowledge has not translated into affordable  access for millions of HIV-infected pregnant women in India, Southeast Asia,  China, and Africa. The only winners were the pharmaceutical industry, for whom  the trials were a world-wide marketing exercise, and individual researchers who  managed to advance their careers by publishing the research results in academic  journals.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  is ample evidence that informed consent is not taken seriously in many clinical  trials western researchers undertake in developing countries. Medical journals  regularly receive information from whistle blowers in the health-care  profession about patients who were either not adequately informed, or who felt  coerced into trials. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Karim, QA, Karim SSA et al. Informed consent for HIV testing in a South African Hospital: is it truly informed and truly voluntary? American Journal of public health 1998; 88: 637-640" id="6">(6)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Given that ethics in medicine is discussed more today than ever before, such  reported failures to live up to basic ethics requirements should lead to  improved standards in clinical research. On the contrary, as Peter Lurie, a  medical researcher with the US voluntary organisation Public Citizen, points  out, it is the same old story: <em>"Write the rules, break the rules, get caught,  change the rules"</em>. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Personal communication." id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					At the  end of the 20th century, we are witnessing an unprecedented assault on research  ethics standards. In April, the WMA's Council meeting in Santiago, Chile,  discussed changes allowing researchers to operate on the basis of much lower  research ethics standards in developing countries. The permissible use of  placebo controls in clinical trials would be dramatically widened if the  proposed changes came into effect. The WMA decided, however, that its national  medical association members would be consulted after serious protests lodged by  the British, Japanese and South African Medical Associations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most  importantly, according to the proposed revisions of the Declaration of Helsinki  and the CIOMS Guidelines, the standard of care to be provided by researchers to  their subjects is determined by the standard of the community where the  research takes place. In other words, western researchers testing a drug in a  community too poor to provide its members basic medical care are under no  ethical obligation to provide their subjects with even basic care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The proposed changes also have implications for people living in western  societies without universal health care. Participants in a clinical trial who  can afford access to better (i.e. private) care will get better care than those  who have to rely on basic (i.e. public) health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Delegates  of national medical associations from developing countries do the ethical thing  and reject the proposed changes during the next General Assembly of the WMA in  October 1999. Readers of Issues in medical ethics who would like to receive  further information, or who might contemplate supporting the efforts by Public  Citizen to prevent the proposed watering down of the Declaration of Helsinki  should contact the organisation's Dr Lurie at e-mail: <a href="mailto:plurie@citizen.org">plurie@citizen.org.</a> On  a more general level, I would welcome proposals on how to make both the WMA and  the CIOMS documents property of the international community of professionals  and activists, rather than the property of democratically and professionally  unaccountable organisations.

				<h4>Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research</h4>
				<p>
					Editor:  Daya Krishna
				</p>
				<p>
					The journal is published thrice yearly by the Indian Council of Philosophical  Research (ICPR). It is devoted to the publication of original papers of high  standard in any branch of philosophy. One of the objectives of the ICPR is to  encourage interdisciplinary research with direct philosophical relevance.  Accordingly, contributions from scholars in other fields of knowledge, dealing  with specific philosophical problems connected with their respective fields of  specialisation, would be highly welcome.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  good and original contributions pertaining to any branch of traditional  philosophy would be equally welcome. Each regular issue of the journal will  contain, besides full-length papers, discussions and comments, notes on paper,  book reviews, information on new books and other relevant academic information.  Each issue will contain about 160-180 pages (Royal 8vo).
