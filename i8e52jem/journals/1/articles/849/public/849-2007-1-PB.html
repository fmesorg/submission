					We are shocked that Dr  Chittaranjan Andrade should make a case for direct ECT (electroconvulsive  therapy) in your recent Issues in Medical Ethics <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;XI:9-10." id="1">(1)</a>. We want to place before  your readers the facts that are unreported or otherwise masked in his article.

				<h4>Direct and modified ECT</h4>
				<p>
					In direct ECT, an  electric current of 70-170 volts is passed for 0.5-1.5 seconds. It throws the  body into epilepsy-like seizures. While the patient is conscious in the  beginning, he is rendered unconscious when the grand mal seizure starts. He is  held down physically to prevent fractures and internal injuries, as the risk of  injury is high. As the procedure is given in series, this hazard is experienced  again and again. In an ideal situation, the procedure is repeated 6-10 times,  but continuous dosing up to 20 times or more is not uncommon. This procedure  has recently been placed as a controversial and contested issue before the  Supreme Court, through a petition filed by Saarthak, a mental health NGO based  in New Delhi. A verdict on this issue is awaited.
				</p>
				<p>
					In its 'modern' or  'modified' form (modified ECT), the patient is not allowed to eat or drink for  four hours or more before the procedure, to reduce the risk of vomiting and  incontinence. Medication may be given to reduce secretions from the mouth.  Muscle relaxants and anaesthesia are given to reduce the overt  epileptic/muscular convulsions and patient anxiety. The muscle relaxant  paralyses all the muscles of the body, including those of the respiratory  system. The patient does not breathe on his own while the relaxant works and he  is put on an artificial respirator during the procedure. A 'crash cart' is kept  handy, with a variety of life-saving devices and medications, including a  defibrillator for kick-starting the heart in case of a cardiac arrest. The brain  is subjected to seizure activity induced by the electric current. The causal  mechanism by which the treatment works is not known. It is believed that the  electricity itself and the seizure activity it produces is the curing element.

				<h4>Evolution and phasing out of ECT</h4>
				<p>
					Ugo Cerletti, an  Italian, invented ECT in 1938, drawing inspiration from the fact that pigs  being prepared for slaughter in an abattoir were first rendered unconscious by  passing electricity through bilateral placement of electrodes against the head.  After much brutal experimentation and research, the developed world banned  direct ECT in the early 1960s. Many European countries have phased out even  modified ECT, while in the US its usage has come down drastically after the 1980s,  following class action. The 1978 American Psychiatric Association (APA) Task  Force reported that only 16% of psychiatrists gave (modified) ECT. ECT research  does not receive funding from government bodies, or from large foundations. It  is largely funded by private business. International journals do not publish  articles on direct ECT.
				</p>
				<p>
					To make a case for  direct ECT in this day and age establishes a fresh, new low for psychiatric  ethics in India. Instead of debating the issue of 'whether or not ECT' and what  community alternatives we can create in mental health, we are placed in this  ridiculous situation of debating direct ECT.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Andrade claims that  direct ECT is 'virtually' risk-free. However, neither in his article nor in any  of the relevant research in India, some of which is mentioned herein, has  anyone vouchsafed even the relative safety of ECT, whether direct or modified.  The only argument made is that modified ECT is even worse than direct ECT.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Side-effects and risks of ECT</h4>
				<p>
					In the West, two important  factors led to the phasing out of direct ECT: one was the discovery that  between 0.5% and 20% of patients suffered from vertebral fractures, and the  second was their evident terror and trauma. Dr Andrade admits that direct ECT  is associated with the risk of vertebral/thoracic fractures, dislocation of  various joints, muscle or ligament tears, cardiac arrhythmias, fluid secretion  into respiratory tract, internal tears, injuries and blood-letting, other than  fear and anxiety.
				</p>
				<p>
					Kiloh et al. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kiloh LG, Smith JS, Johnson GF (eds). Physical treatments in psychiatry. London: Blackwell,1988." id="2">(2)</a> give  this long list of common 'complaints' following ECT, which are more acutely  experienced when given direct: headache, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, muscle  stiffness, pain, visual impairment due to conjunctival haemorrhages,  tachycardia/bradycardia, surges in blood pressure, changes in cardiovascular  activity, alteration in the blood-brain barrier, ECG changes, arrhythmias and  dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, sudden death, transient dysphasia, amenorrhoea,  hemiparesis, tactile/visual inattention, homonymous hemianopia. Among the  'risks' mentioned are : myocardial infarction, pulmonary abscesses, pulmonary  embolism, activation of pulmonary tuberculosis, rupture of the colon with  peritonitis, gastric haemorrhage, perforation of a peptic ulcer, haemorrhage  into the thyroid, epistaxis, adrenal haemorrhage, strangulated hernia, and  cerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Infrequent 'complications' are fractures  (vertebrae, femur, scapula, humerus) and dislocations (jaw, shoulder), cardiac  arrhythmias, apnoea and 'tardive' convulsions. Among the inevitable  'side-effects' are cardiovascular responses, postictal clouding of  consciousness and memory impairment. With modified ECT, the effects are 'less  likely' but not completely ruled out.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is it about being  mentally ill that permits society and medical professionals like Andrade to  argue that being exposed to these risks repeatedly is all right? Even  professionals never considered ECT to be a 'cure', it is only palliative. This  means that in practice, professionals can use it as and when they like, as  palliative care can be seen as an ongoing need, unlike curative care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Andrade cites 'further  evidence' of research by Tharyan et al. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physi-cal morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experi-ence. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="3">(3)</a>, highly (mis)quoted studies done in  the early 1990s on direct ECT. He writes that in this study only 12 patients  experienced fractures out of a total of 1835 patients receiving 13,597  treatments. This sounds as if a few of the patients walked out of the ECT room  with a slight twisting of the middle finger. He fails to mention relevant data  from this study that these were thoracic/vertebral fractures involving almost a  third of the body vertebrae. Andrade also fails to mention that in this study,  there was one reported death due to cardiac arrest (i.e. 1 patient out of 1,835  died), a good percentage experienced bodyaches, both local and generalized, and  another 1% of patients had cardiac complications. These data, especially the  spinal injury and the mortality rate, which from the consumer point of view  seem horrific, are not considered 'clinically significant' by the authors of  this contentious study nor by Andrade. In Andrade's own study <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Rele K, Sutharshan R, Shah N. Musculoskeletal morbidity with unmodified ECT may be less than earlier believed. Indian J Psychiatry 2000;42:156-162." id="4">(4)</a>, 2% of the  patients experienced a 'musculoskeletal event'.

				<h4>Findings and recommendations</h4>
				<p>
					The recent APA Task  Force on ECT <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Task Force Reports (1978, 1990, 2001) on ECT. American Psychiatric Association, USA." id="5">(5)</a> notes that, contrary to earlier evidence, they have to now  acknowledge that mortality rates with ECT (modified) may be as high as 1 in  10,000 patients. Consumers <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Frank LR. Electroshock: a crime against the spirit, In a Nutshell 2002-2003;Fall/Winter:16-22." id="6">(6)</a> say that mortality rates may be as high as 1%  with modified ECT. The mortality rates are probably higher among the elderly,  making it a highly contested procedure among them. The Task Force report also  notes that 1 in 200 may experience irretrievable memory loss. The Bombay High  Court ordered against the use of direct ECT way back in 1989, following the  Mahajan Committee Recommendations. In Goa too, legal advocacy and the proactive  role of psychiatrists has resulted in the ban of direct ECT.
				</p>
				<p>
					Death in the case of ECT  is usually due to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications, followed by  respiratory failure. Shukla <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shukla GD. Death following ECT-a case report. Indian J Psychiatry 1985;27:95-97." id="7">(7)</a>, in discussing a case report of death following  modified ECT, reviews the mortality data associated with the procedure. Rates  between 0.003% and 0.8% have been reported in the western literature. Shukla,  finding it a curious fact that deaths have not been reported at all in the  Indian professional literature, observes that fatalities are not always  publicly reported, particularly in India, but every psychiatrist would have  experienced such cases in his practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The European CPT  (Convention for the Prevention of Torture) 2002 <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="CPT. European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Commitment to psychiatric establishments, Section 39-ECT, Council of Europe Convention, 2002." id="8">(8)</a> prohibits the use of direct  ECT as a form of torture. One of the reasons cited is the terror experienced by  patients during the use of the procedure. The suggestion in this Convention and  other relevant literature is that ECT affects the limbic system of the brain,  the same system that is affected by deep trauma. Medical narratives regarding  direct ECT highlight the very understandable horror of experiencing ECT effects  as well as accidents and disabilities following a procedure which is supposed  to 'cure' <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wiseman B. Psychiatry: the ultimate betrayal. Freedom Publishing Co. A Publication of Citizens Commission for Human Rights, LA, California, 1995." id="9">(9)</a>. The motor, physiological and cognitive effects on ECT recipients  following treatment are the same as trauma victims. The terror is a sign of  trauma, and not a sign of insanity. Victims of direct ECT should be considered  as victims of medical torture and brought within human rights and medicolegal  jurisprudence.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the study by Tharyan  et al. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physi-cal morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experi-ence. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="3">(3)</a> a high percentage of patients (7.5%) reported fear and apprehension  of the procedure, and 50 patients refused the treatment. How did the  researchers proceed with the study? They did so by actually sedating the  patients! Quoting them in full: 'A fifty of them [patients] refused further ECT  due to this fear while in the remainder (100 patients) the fear was reduced by  sedative premedication enabling them to complete the course of ECT. In the  earlier half of the decade under review, barbiturates, oral diazepam,  parenteral haloperidol and even thiopentone were used to allay anxiety; in  recent years, this has been effectively managed by pretreatment with 1 to 4 mg  of lorazepam given orally.' The authors of this study find it an interesting  observation that those who refused were not among those who were sedated. Their  study also suggests that it is common practice to sedate patients who refuse  ECT. Amazingly, they recommend the use of sedatives to minimize the fear of  ECT. Such is the prejudicial approach to mentally ill patients that fearful  refusal of a hazardous and life-threatening procedure is considered as a mere  symptom of insanity, to be further 'treated' with sedatives. How do  professionals reconcile ethical issues of consent in such instances?
				</p>
				<p>
					In many countries,  giving even modified ECT to children, the elderly and pregnant women is  prohibited. The State of Utah is recently working on a bill which will ban ECT  within institutions (where its highest abuse is possible) and on children. In  Tharyan et al.'s study <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physi-cal morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experi-ence. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="3">(3)</a>, direct ECT has been administered to the age group  14-70 years, including women in all trimesters of pregnancy. How did the  institutional ethics committee (IEC) of Christian Medical College (CMC), the  site of this study, allow this study to continue uninterrupted for 11 years?
				</p>
				<p>
					Tharyan et al. further  reassure that 'trained' professionals were used to give direct ECT. What does  training mean in the context of direct ECT? One merely needs some physically  strong people to tie down the patient at strategic points to keep the jaw and  joint areas from major injury. The composition of the full 'team' used to  prevent injury were: four orderlies, three nurses, two postgraduate trainees  and a consultant psychiatrist, a total of 10 'trained' people! The argument  concerning the cost-effectiveness of the procedure is not validated by this  study. Even with a full load of 10 people tying down a patient from the  convulsions, the reported injury rate was not insignificant. Have the costs of  disability-days following ECT been taken into account? Kiloh et al. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kiloh LG, Smith JS, Johnson GF (eds). Physical treatments in psychiatry. London: Blackwell,1988." id="2">(2)</a> reported studies where the ECT took only a few hours, but the patients had to  be hospitalized for a week after that, waiting for the confusion and suicidal  ideation to clear up!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Why is ECT given?</h4>
				<p>
					Why would presumably  rational scientists produce such irrational arguments to safeguard a  scientifically dubious and highly hazardous procedure? The fact is that in  nearly every city, a majority of private practitioners give ECT in their  private clinics. A recent survey in western India showed that nearly 80% of  private psychiatrists give ECT, costing anywhere between Rs 500 and 1000 for  one. ECT is the only piece of technology that psychiatry can boast of. There  are psychiatrists who ask the patient to first take an ECT even before  consultation <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bapu Workshop. 'Right to Rehabilitation of Persons with Mental Illness', August 24, 2002, Indian Social Institute,New Delhi." id="10">(10)</a>! ECT has been given to cure 'Naxalism' <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ramaswamy G. A remembered rage, Aaina, January 2000." id="11">(11)</a>. In private  practice, it is difficult to have the medical back-up necessary for anaesthesia  or resuscitation. ECT guidelines do not exist in India, making it conducive for  doctors to engage in rampant abuse of the procedure. The situation here is  similar to sex selection tests, as the private market rules the roost.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					In our view, direct ECT  is a matter for human rights law, prevention of torture instruments, regulation  and consumer litigation, and not for academic discussion. Andrade suggests that  there must be further research on direct ECT. We have serious objections to the  future conduct of such research. Statutory authorities, the human rights  commision and medical regulatory bodies must proscribe such research.
