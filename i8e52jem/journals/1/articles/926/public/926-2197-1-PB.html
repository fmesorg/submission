				<h4>Disparities in pay of medical teachers all over India:
				need for a central governing body</h4>
				<p>
					While most professions have national level bodies governing
					the pay structure of their teachers, there is no functional body
					to govern the pay of medical teachers. The result is that the net
					pay of teachers in the central institutions (such as AIIMS, and
					the medical colleges of Chandigarh University etc) is higher
					than that of their counterparts in the medical colleges run by
					state governments. There is a central body, the Medical Council
					of India (MCI), which maintains standards of medical education
					all over the country. Recently, the MCI stated that medical
					teachers should be paid in accordance with the University
					Grants Commission (UGC) scales. However, no proper directions
					have been given. There have been agitations demanding UGC
					pay-scales for teachers in Rajasthan, Gujarat and other states

					have agreed to these scales, apart from dearness allowance
					(DA) and non-practice allowance (NPA), they have left out many
					of the allowances paid in central medical institutes, the sum of
					which could well be above INR 40,000 per month.

				<p>
					There has been a hike in the allowances of medical teachers in
					central institutes <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Allowances for medical teachers to be hiked. 2011 Jun [cited 2013 Oct 23].

					decided on a policy for the grant of these allowances. Medical
					teachers in some states are given a conveyance allowance of
					just INR 1600 per month, which is very low compared to that
					given at the central level, i.e. INR 5000 per month. Recently,
					the Kerala government has started paying a risk allowance
					and a patient care allowance, which is 15% of the basic pay of doctors <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pay revision order.

					as book allowance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctors in the central institutes are as dedicated to treating
					and serving patients as are medical teachers in the states. The
					number of outdoor and indoor patients per day in state-owned
					hospitals such as the BJ Medical College, which is attached to
					the Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, is equal to, if not more than,
					that in central institutions. The number of hours of work put in
					by state medical teachers is also similar to that put in by their
					counterparts in central institutions. The Standard Treatment
					Guidelines (STGs) in all hospitals, whether run by the Central
					government or state governments, are the same, as is the
					teaching work. Then why is there a disparity in pay? Why should
					only state medical teachers be deprived? Why not the teachers
					in degree or engineering colleges? Why has an upper ceiling
					of pay been fixed only for doctors? Are there any concrete
					reasons or is it just because it does not suit the bureaucrats? In
					one of the states, the NPA for the Sixth Pay Commission arrears
					was treated as notional and deducted in three instalments
					from 2006 to 2009 (out of a total of five instalments). Why, all
					of a sudden, did the authorities feel that the NPA should not be
					paid in full for those particular working years (2006-2009) and
					should be deducted in arrears? Are there any rules to clarify
					this deduction? <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Revision of rates of non-private practising allowance being paid to the medical officers in the state under 6th Central Pay Commission (CPC) -Clarification.

				</p>
				<p>
					Are doctors working in the states not subject to risks such as
					HIV and hepatitis B? Is it only doctors in the central institutes
					who do night duty and care for patients? Do only central
					doctors need books to study, and not state doctors? Justice
					needs to be done and doctors in the state institutes, too, should
					be given all these allowances.
