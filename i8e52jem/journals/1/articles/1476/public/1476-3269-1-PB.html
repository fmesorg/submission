				<h4>Advertisement approved by the IMA?</h4>
				<p>
					This is to bring to your attention an advertisement on the back page of the June, 1998 issue of the <em>Journal of Occupational and Industrial Medicine,</em> for the soap Lifebuoy Plus. The ad carries the claim that it has been approved by the Indian Medical Association.</p>
<p>If the claim is authentic, the question arises of the credibility of the premier organisation of medical practitioners in India. Are the different medical associations empowered to approve these consumer products? I feel that the use of names of medical associations to promote products and influence consumers is unethical on the part of the advertising agency as well as the medical association. Would you look into the matter and inquire with the related parties?

				<h4>Note</h4>
				<p>
					The advertising agency confirms that the Lifebuoy advertisement contains a statement of certification by the IMA. Dr Kishor Gandeja, president of the Mumhai branch of the IMA confirms that the IMA is endorsing some products, after conducting laboratory tests. Dr. Ruparel, Maharashtra state vice-president of the IMA, will look into the matter and respond to this letter in the next issue of the journal.
