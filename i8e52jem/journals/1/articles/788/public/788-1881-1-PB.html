					Dr  Sanjeev Gupta returned to the UK because he found the practice of medicine in  India professionally unsatisfying, ethically problematic and financially  unrewarding. His experiences will evoke empathy and perhaps deja vu among many  medical professionals in India. Let us look at each of these areas.
				</p>

				<h4>Professional  satisfaction</h4>
				<p>
					Dr  Gupta found medical practice in India unscientific. Generally speaking, there  was little evidence-based practice; specifically there was a misuse of  antibiotics and an overuse of investigations. Although many doctors paid lip  service to scientific principles, they did not practise them. Dr Gupta tried  discussions; they did not work. There is no doubt that his experience mirrors  the reality. In India, there are no protocols for antibiotic usage,  investigations or the indications for surgery. Here and there, some hospitals  and individuals do have such protocols, but these are the exceptions, not the  rule. In short, there are no systems. While doctors in countries that have set  up such systems sometimes complain of over-regulation, it is generally accepted  that such systems have ensured better outcomes for patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  Indian 'medical bazaar', the patient has no guidance system. The media is full  of glowing reports of this or that hospital (mostly private), doing this or  that procedure. Most of these procedures are routinely done abroad and within  the competence of a large number of practitioners in India. The procedures are  usually uncommon only because they are expensive. In the absence of good  quality information, the public is led to believe that the expensive treatment  being touted is the 'best'. There is hardly any information on the appropriate  indications or the problems that can arise. Unfortunately, people of doubtful  integrity often dominate the professional bodies that should be involved in evolving  protocols. Nearly all professional bodies are used as another medium to  advertise the medical glitterati. We, the medical professionals, should force  these bodies to evolve guidelines. The public, through various self-help  groups, should demand the same. This great change in medical practice in India  will not come on its own. Individual doctors talking to colleagues, as Dr Gupta  did, will help, but this is not enough.

				<h4>Ethical  problems</h4>

				<p>
					The  problem of practising ethical medicine in India is closely linked to the lack  of professionalism and systems. Many of the problems that Dr Gupta enumerates,  such as taking cuts for referrals, not being open about the cost of treatment,  misleading the patient about the appropriate treatment, etc., are blatantly wrong.  They are possible because of the absence of a system. Since patients have no  method except hearsay, to choose between different doctors, they are vulnerable  to exploitation. Unless we set up a system of area-wise demarcation for general  practitioners, a referral system and regular audits of practice, such unethical  practices are likely to continue. It is ironic that way back in 1946, Joseph  Bhore suggested such a system. Many governments have paid lip service to it,  but vested interests have successfully sabotaged its implementation.

				<h4>Financial  rewards</h4>

				<p>
					Many  doctors in India struggle to make ends meet at the beginning of their careers.  Those who have read A J Cronin's accounts of medicine in the UK in the early  part of the 20th century will find parallels with the present situation in  India. Perhaps financial difficulties push the young doctor into unethical  practices.

				<h4>Questions</h4>

				<p>
					Is it  impossible to practise ethical medicine in India? Are all doctors in India  unethical and unprofessional? The answer to both questions is an emphatic no.  There are many thoroughly professional and ethical doctors. It is difficult but  not impossible to practise scientifically sound and ethically irreproachable  medicine in India. However, this usually involves sacrifices. Most doctors, for  whom science and ethics are paramount, sacrifice professional advancement and  financial reward. They are found everywhere: in low-profile general practices,  trust hospitals and the state-run medical system. However, these niches can be  a sort of solution for the individual doctor. They are certainly not the  solution to the systemic problems of medical care in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					One  last issue remains: Should Dr Gupta have remained in India? The decision to  live and work in a particular place is complex and highly personal. For those  fortunate enough to have a choice in the matter, it is obvious that they will  choose the place where they are comfortable. Dr Gupta is troubled by his  decision to return to the UK. He seems to consider it a betrayal of his  motherland. Here I think he has confused a lot of issues. He talks of his  admiration for freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Khudiram Bose and their  readiness to die to achieve the independence of India. He feels that returning  to work in India is a present-day equivalent. I feel that the two situations  are in no way similar. Love of any kind, including that for one's country, does  not exist in a vacuum. The struggle for the freedom of India was rooted in the  personal oppression that all Indians faced in greater or smaller measure. The  struggle for freedom was also a struggle for individual freedom. It was based  on the understanding that no Indian could be a full citizen of India, let alone  of the world, unless the country was free. In this extreme situation some  exceptional people were willing to make exceptional sacrifices.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Gupta's situation is different. It is not obvious that the country has a  pressing need for specialists like him. In fact, in the urban areas, there is  already a surplus of specialists. In the remote parts of India, where they are  in short supply, there are probably no facilities to practise the kind of  medicine that Dr Gupta is accustomed to. He returned to India out of a vague  and romantic desire to 'serve the country'. It is not surprising that he was  easily disappointed when the country did not make this 'service' easy! In the  absence of any special need for his services he felt neither wanted nor  appreciated. In addition, the financial rewards were meagre. In such a  situation, the life he had left in the UK must have seemed good indeed and it  is not surprising that he returned.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  desire to contribute to one's native land is noble. Those who undergo extreme  hardship to serve their fellow citizens definitely deserve praise and appreciation.  However, if one does not have the stomach for this kind of sacrifice, there is  no need to feel guilty. It is far better to serve people gladly in a place of  one's choice than to be constantly unhappy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nowadays,  a kind of pseudonationalism seems to be popular among expatriate Indians.  Usually it takes the easy path of financial support for regressive practices  and political parties in India, under the guise of supporting 'traditions',  'Indian values' and the like. Few people have the capacity to forsake a  comfortable life in the service of their fellow citizens. Dr Gupta has provided  a graphic description of what a medical practitioner returning to India is  likely to face. Working for change is never easy.
