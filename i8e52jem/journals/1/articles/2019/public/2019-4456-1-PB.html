				<h4>General practice</h4>

					I enjoyed reading the articles on changing trends  in general practice <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pednekar A.

General practice: some thoughts. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 15-16" id="6">6)</a>. I was disappointed that no one bothered  to discuss the important role patients can play in improving the ethical  standards of medical practice. Why do doctors assume that they are the center  of the medical universe, and that patients cannot be trusted to make their own  decisions ? If good doctors spend time and energy in educating their patients,  standards of medical practice would improve, as patients would then have tools  they could use to evaluate the quality of their medical care - and the quality  of their doctor-patient education can help to weed out quacks and unethical  doctors who make unrealistic promises.
