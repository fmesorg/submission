				<h4>Testing patients for HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Regarding  Dr V Raman Kutty's article on ethics in public health practice <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Raman Kutty V. Ethics in public health practice. Issues in Medical Ethics2000: 111-112." id="1">(1)</a>, I  beg to differ with the author with respect to the following statement:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Perhaps they  forget that the patient has an equal right to know the HIV status of their  health practitioner, since it is a well known route of spread."
				</p>
				<p>
					May I ask the  author where he got this reference from? I believe that such reciprocal transmission  is yet to be reported in case of HIV.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a few  other points to raise. Why is there such secrecy about AIDS? Would you not like  to know overall incidence and prevalence of HIV-infected patients in the  region? If you don't have the statistics, how do you understand the extent of  the epidemic? How are you going to fight it on a war footing if you don't even  know (or want to know) statistics of infected individuals? If acute polio can  be a notifiable disease, why not HIV? How ethical is it for an individual who  has acquired HIV from other sources to knowingly infect his wife who is  ignorant of his status? Is there any insurance policy or a job security for an  individual who acquired the infection accidentally while serving humanity?  There are no easy answers to these questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel there  are many misperceptions and much hypocrisy when we talk about treating the HIV  patient ethically. We need to change the overall attitude of society towards  HIV patients. I fully agree with the concept that under no circumstance should  there be discrimination against AIDS patients. However, I do not agree that HIV  testing should not be made routine before any intervention. I can defend my  statement for the reason that even the largest public hospitals in India will  not be able to afford the expenses of medical and paramedical staff taking  universal precautions for all patients routinely.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me quote  the British Orthopaedic Association's recommendations on what should be worn by  the surgical team for the prevention of HIV and Hepatitis infection in  operation theatres (these are only excerpts):
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Protection  of face and head:</em> 1. Full eye protection goggles or  visor, not spectacles; 2. Closely fitting hood of finely woven material, or  disposable paper, covering the neck; 3. Ventilated hood or gown in high risk  cases. (<em>comment: these are currently not available in India</em>).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Gowns</em>: cotton gowns are not acceptable. Wrapover type of adequate  length gown made up of high quality disposable paper, preferably laminated at  the front and sleeves. They should be of a fabric with proven resistance to  strike through.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Gloves</em>: Double gloving with cotton outer gloves. Frequent changes  of the outer gloves are recommended.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Foot protection</em>: Wellington boots impervious to  penetration, knee high, well overlapped by the gown.
				</p>
				<p>
					In every case  these precautions are obviously not practical. The question here is, are we  well equipped and ready to treat HIV cases in epidemic proportions?
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors are  like soldiers on the battlefield. Their dedication, commitment and sincerity  should not be questioned. Are we going to ask our soldiers to lay their lives  without arming them adequately for the fight against the very strong enemy?  Denying the obvious fact that most public hospitals do not have these amenities  is like pulling a hood over one's eyes. Also, there is no quality control over  the 'HIV kit' they provide the staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical issues  need to be re-examined in this perspective.

				<h4>Risk of HIV from  surgeons</h4>
				<p>
					It is  now an established routine that all patients undergoing 	surgery have to be  screened for Hepatitis B and sometimes Hepatitis C, in addition to HIV.  Although it entails an additional financial burden on the patient and has its  lacunae, it is tacitly accepted by the patient. It is ostensibly meant to  prevent the surgical team from being exposed to the virus.
				</p>
				<p>
					Has not the patient  got an equal right to protect himself by asking the surgeon to have his blood  test done? I know of three surgeons who test positive for the above infections.  One is an old case of Hepatitis B and another is strongly positive. A third is  positive for Hepatitis C and suffers from pancytopenia but continues to operate  on patients with what can be called cursory precautions. In my opinion it  should be mandatory for hospitals to screen surgical staff periodically. I  invite the opinions of your readers on this issue.

				<h4>Education without  sponsorship</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Excerpts  from a letter to the president of the Poladpur Medical Association, Poladpur,  Raigad, Maharashtra:</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					I was  impressed by the 80 per cent attendance for my talk on how to start and continue CPR or initial management of cardiac  arrest in a rural area. Until now, I have attended more than 50 CMEs, but not a  single one was arranged without sponsorshipâ€¦ It was really creditable on the  part of doctors practising in remote rural areas, where they are the backbone  of rural health care, because in today's era, everything from tea to the toilet  is sponsored. I noticed that everybody was taking a keen interest in the  lecture...because their minds were not at all diverted as routinely happens in  a sponsored conference due to stalls and other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sir, I admire you  and your members for the way they have adapted for learning and avoiding  becoming slaves of sponsorship. I hope this message is conveyed to all  presidents and officials who are putting their major energy into searching for  sponsors for medical CMEs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,
				</p>

				<h4> Stop  press: a landmark judgment </h4>
				<p>
					On  September 4, 2001, the Bombay High Court held that accredited members of the press shall be  permitted to attend inquiry proceedings conducted by the  Maharashtra 	Medical Council to probe misconduct of medical  practitioners. 	" ... MMC cannot hold the view that inquiry proceedings  held under Section 	 	22 of  the MMC Act of 1965 are confidential in nature and have to be held  in 	camera." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Express, October 22, 2001." id="2">(1)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The judgement was  in response to a case filed in the early 1990s, by Ms. Saroj Iyer, journalist;  the Medico Friend Circle Bombay Group; The Forum for Medical Ethics Society and  Lok Hith. The case was filed in relation to a complaint by Mr. PC Singhi to the  MMC, against Dr. Prafull Desai, surgeon at the Bombay Hospital. The MMC judged  Dr. Prafull Desai guilty of two 	 	misconducts, but  was punished only with a warning. Ms Saroj Iyer, who was also active in the  MFC, was not 	 	allowed to witness the proceedings. This  judgement will be an important precedent for the presence of witnesses in  Medical Council Inquiries. If a journalist is allowed, it should not be  difficult for doctors and laypersons to claim the right to witness an inquiry.  Are there any takers for such legal action?
				</p>
				<p>
					Three  precendent-setting high court judgments have emerged from MFC's (Bombay Group)  campaign on medical malpractice: on registration and standards in private  nursing homes (following from the case involving Ms. Yasmin Tawaria), the  patient's right to a copy of medical 	 	records (Mr.  Raghunath Raheja), and, now, allowing journalists 	to witness an MMC  inquiry against doctors (Mr. PC Singhi).
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Singhi's long  fight in the civil and criminal courts is still on, and he has won several  battles here. Some of these rulings are also precedent setting, and can be used  by others. Some have been described in the book documenting MFC's work in  Mumbai:<em>Market, medicine, malpractice</em>.

				<h4>Consumer rights as  applied to vaccine usage in  India</h4>
				<p>
					The  eight consumers' rights as defined by the <strong>International Organization of Consumers' Union</strong> are  as follows :
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to safety</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be protected against products, production processes and  services which are hazardous to health or life. The right to safety has been  broadened to include the concern for consumers' long-term interests, not only  their immediate desires. Vaccines introduced in this country are cleared on the  basis of foreign trials and data. Safety and efficacy trials on Indian subjects  are done in a hurry just before licensing. These trials merely test antibody  responses and very few trials monitor adverse reactions over a prolonged period  of time
				</p>
				<p>
					There are virtually  no guidelines on what training personnel administering vaccines should undergo.  Camps are organised where ignorant people administer vaccines. Most fatalities  related to mass vaccination are due to ignorance by the staff. Storage of  vaccines is woefully inadequate; most centres administering vaccines do not  have the appropriate facilities to handle serious reactions to vaccines.  Dangerous vaccines are still available and are used on vulnerable segments of  our population &mdash; such as the whole brain rabies vaccine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Vaccine adverse  reaction monitoring systems are not available freely and very few physicians,  consumers or pharmaceutical companies use them.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to be informed</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be given the facts needed to make an informed choice or  decision. This goes beyond avoiding deception and protection against misleading  advertising, labeling or other practices. Consumers should be provided with  adequate information, enabling them to act wisely and responsibly. This is a  right which has been abused with regards to immunisation. On the one hand we  have a large populace of illiterate people whose children are subject to a  paternalistic system where they are not given information on any vaccine given  to their children. On the other hand, a barrage of half-baked truths is fed to  the educated, illiterate, urban rich, inducing them to immunise their children  against diseases for which we know neither the incidence nor the efficacy of  the vaccine in our population.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to choose</h5>
				<p>
					This  refers to access to a variety of products and services at competitive prices  and, in the case of monopolies, to have an assurance of satisfactory quality  and service at a fair price. The right to choose has been reformulated to read: <strong>the  right to basic goods and services</strong>. This is because the unrestrained right  of a minority to choose can mean for the majority a denial of its fair share.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here again we have  a populace who is utterly ignorant of its choices. Not only are there a number  of vaccines against various diseases, there are also a number of brands within  each vaccine, and with different combinations. Their costs vary, leaving the  medical profession and public confused. The assurance of the availability of  essential vaccines rests with the government. The government has taken  excellent initiative in making essential vaccines available. It is also a  credit to the government that the cost of importing vaccines is entirely borne  by the state and is not dependent on foreign aid.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to be heard</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to be represented so that consumers' interest receives full and  sympathetic consideration in the formulation and execution of economic policy.  This right is being broadened to include the right to be heard and represented  in the development of products and services before they are produced or set up.  It also implies a representation, not only in government policies, but also in  those of other economic powers. This right should be invoked in the recent  controversy over the inclusion of the Hepatitis B vaccine in the national  immunisation programme. A thorough cost-benefit and risk benefit analysis  should be undertaken before introducing this vaccine. Just because the  vaccine's cost is coming down and it is being indigenously manufactured does  not automatically mean that it should be introduced in the national programme.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to redressal</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to a fair settlement of just claims. This right has been  generally accepted since the early 1970s. It involves the right to receive  compensation for misrepresentation or shoddy goods or services. Where needed,  free legal aid or an accepted form of redress for small claims should be  available. This right unfortunately is not available to most of our population.  There is no vaccine injury compensation programme. The legal rights are also  not very clear. With the passage of the CPA, this may change.
				</p>
				<h5>The  right to consumer education</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to acquire the knowledge and skills to be an informed consumer  throughout one's life. The right to consumer education incorporates the right  to the knowledge and skills needed for taking action to influence factors which  affect consumer decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Very little is done  to educate the populace on vaccines and their effects or adverse reactions.  With a large population, differing literacy levels and a multiplicity of  languages, mass communication is a challenging task
				</p>
                <h5>The  right to a healthy environment</h5>
				<p>
					This  means the right to a physical environment that will enhance the quality of  life. This right involves protection against environmental problems over which  the individual consumer has control. It acknowledges the need to protect and  improve the environment for present and future generations. Provision of clean  drinking water is probably more important than immunising the entire population  against typhoid or hepatitis A.
				</p>
                <h5>The  right to basic needs</h5>
				<p>
					The  right to basic needs means that availability of articles which are the basic  need of every consumer must be ensured. Vaccines should be classified as a  basic need and exempt from taxes. The government must pass laws to compel  essential vaccines and provide for compensation for defined adverse reactions.
				</p>
				<p>
					There should also  be a political will to manufacture essential vaccines indigenously.

				<h4>MFC annual meet 2002: Nutrition and food security</h4>
				<p>
					The  recent developments in Orissa have again brought 	into focus the fact that  food security in India is, at the best of times, precarious. All too often, the  familiar picture of overflowing grain stores and starving people is invoked.  India by all accounts appears to have attained self-sufficiency in food production  with overflowing food stocks and the ability to avert large-scale famines. Yet,  apart from crises during which there are severe food shortages and deaths,  there is evidence that a large proportion of children are malnourished and that  there has been little improvement in the nutritional status of vast sections of  people. Policy changes over the last decade &mdash; liberalisation and WTO  requirements including measures such as removal of quota restrictions, changes  in cropping patterns &mdash; are likely to significantly affect food security. There  are fears that such policies will aggravate the situation of poverty and  unemployment, diminishing people's capacity to feed themselves adequately. This  raises many issues that impinge on many disciplines, necessitating debate that  cuts across a range of sectors and activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to bring  together the evidence and enable discussion, the Medico Friend Circle (MFC) has  organised a meeting on this theme. The Annual Meet-2002 of the MFC to be held  at Sewagram, Wardha on <strong>January 24-26, 2002</strong>, will focus on nutrition and  food security.
				</p>
				<p>
					MFC is an all-India  group of socially conscious individuals from diverse backgrounds, who come  together because of a common concern about the health problems in the country.  MFC includes medical, public health and social science professionals as well as  researchers and students, community health and gender activists. It is a  loosely knit and informal national organisation. Annual meetings usually on a  theme have been a regular feature of its activities. MFC does not receive any  funding and is funded and managed entirely by its members on a voluntary basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Annual Meet  2002 will focus on the following issues:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Status of nutrition/malnutrition in India:  evidence from recent data;
					</li>
					<li>
						Health impact of under-nutrition and  inadequate nutrition;
					</li>
					<li>
						Review of nutrition interventions and related  public policy issues: Public distribution system, Integrated Child Development  Scheme, Mid-Day meal schemes, etc.;
					</li>
					<li>
						Review of nutrition education in  India;
					</li>
					<li>
						Wages and employment and issues in nutrition;
					</li>
					<li>
						Issues in  investigating and documenting under-nutrition, starvation and suspected  starvation-related deaths;
					</li>
					<li>
						Politics  of food and food security including impact of 	WTO, new technology, etc.,  on people, and
					</li>
					<li>
						Food security as a rights issue and related Public  Interest Litigation in courts.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<em><strong>We invite papers  based on the above themes. All relevant papers will be published in the</strong></em><strong> Medico Friend Circle Bulletin <em>and tabled  at the meet. For details about submission of papers and participation in the  meet, please contact:</em></strong><em></em>

				<p>
					The emphasis will  be on field level studies and empirical evidence from different parts of the  country as much as on issues emerging from more formal research studies. The  object of this meet as in other MFC meets will be to facilitate understanding  which participants can 'take back' from the meet and apply in their immediate  work.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, written  papers/paper presentation is not a prerequisite for participation at MFC meets.  We would like to invite all interested activists, scholars, professionals and  students to attend the meet.
