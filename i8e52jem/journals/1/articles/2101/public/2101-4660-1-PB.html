				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					This review of the literature was conducted to identify the challenges faced while establishing institutional ethics committees (IECs) as well as to suggest some solutions. The search of the literature was carried out with the help of the PubMed search engine, using "research ethics committees" (MeSH] and "India" (MeSH]) as the key words for articles published between 2004 and 2012. We found 31 articles related to the topic, and the most common challenge mentioned was inappropriate functioning of IECs (n=17), followed by inappropriate structure (n=14). The authors identified many challenges related to the lack of oversight by regulatory bodies (n=14) as well as issues pertaining to the ethical training of IEC members and investigators (n=13). It is evident from the multitude of papers on the issue that the challenges related to the constitution and functioning of IECs must be given the attention they deserve to ensure that research participants in India are better protected.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Biomedical research involving human participants requires mandatory approval from an appropriately constituted institutional ethics committee (IEC), also referred to as the institutional review board (IRB), ethics review board (ERB) and research ethics board (REB) in other countries. As mentioned in the Belmont report, the ethics committee (EC) must ensure beneficence, as well as justice and respect for research participants, thereby protecting their rights, safety and well-being <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research.

					The guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human participants. New Delhi: ICMR; 2006 [cited 2014 Jun 6]. Available from: http://icmr.nic.in/ethical_guidelines.pdf" id="1">(1)</a> state that it is mandatory for any biomedical research on human participants to be approved by the IEC/IRB before its initiation. This is also supported by the revised Schedule Y in Amendment 2005 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Schedule Y of The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, amendment June 2005. New Delhi: MoHFW; 2005 [cited 2013 Aug 6]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/Drugs&amp;CosmeticAct.pdf" id="2">(2)</a>, which is the local law. Schedule Y also elaborately sets forth the structure and function of the IEC, and gives a detailed explanation of the approval letter. Further, it prescribes that the ICMR guidelines be followed, thus indirectly giving these guidelines the status of a law.

				<p>
					The number of clinical trials in India has increased a great deal in recent years. The country is becoming a hub of research for pharmaceutical companies due to the availability of a vast number of participants, a technically competent workforce, lower costs and a system of regulatory oversight that is relatively relaxed. Apart from this, due to the enormous progress in the field of research, multicentric studies, genetic studies, stem cell studies, etc, are increasingly being conducted in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					A survey conducted by the ICMR in 2003 showed that only 200 of the more than 1200 institutions in India had functional IECs <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Muthuswamy V. Status of ethical review and challenges in India. Indian Pediatr. 2005 Dec;42(12):1189-90." id="3">(3)</a>. According to a report in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation (WHO), India has less than 40 IECs that are properly constituted and functioning <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ghersi D. Clinical trials in India: ethical concerns. Bull World Health Organ. 2008 Aug;86(8):581-2." id="4">(4)</a>. This fact has been reiterated in many articles published in scientific journals <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Thatte UM, Bavdekar SB. Clinical research in India: Great expectations. J Postgrad Med. 2008 Oct-Dec;54(4):318-23." id="5">(5)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although guidelines pertaining to the structure and functioning of IECs were laid down on paper in 1980, they have not been implemented satisfactorily because they are not backed by the strength of legal protection. Thus, there are a number of problems connected with the functioning of IRBs. Although in February 2013, the Government of India passed a rule making it compulsory for IECs to register themselves with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India.

Available at: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/G.S.R%2072(E)%20dated%2008.02.2013.pdf" id="6">(6)</a>, several challenges remain.
				</p>
				<p>
					This review of the literature was conducted to identify the challenges faced while establishing IECs with a special emphasis on their structure and functioning as well as to suggest some solutions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					We conducted a review of the literature, especially Indian studies, investigating the challenges faced by IECs, the relevant issues pertaining to them, as well as their deficiencies, and examined any solutions offered by these studies. The initial search, for articles published between 2004 and 2012, was carried out with the help of the <em>PubMed</em> search engine using the medical subject headings [MeSH] "research ethics committees" and "India" as the key words. The study was restricted to articles in the English language. The review covered articles that focused on challenges and relevant solutions related to the structure, functioning and role of IECs, the training of their members, regulatory issues, societal concerns and conflicts of interest.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					We found and reviewed 108 studies related to the topic. Thirty-one articles related to the structure and functioning of IECs in India were shortlisted. The following types of articles were included: observational studies, review articles, "viewpoint by expert" articles (7 each), editorials (n=5), correspondence (n=3) and news bulletins (n=2).The maximum number of reviewed articles was published in the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</em> (n=17) and <em>Perspectives in Clinical Research</em> (n=5) while seven were from other Indian journals. One article each was from the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> (NEJM) and <em>Biomed Central (BMC) Medical Ethics</em>. Some authors have been quoted more than once because they have published different articles addressing various issues related to IECs and the challenges faced by them. This matter has been noted while tabulating the data. Table 1 provides a summary of the challenges mentioned. The most common challenge mentioned is the inappropriate functioning of IECs (n=17) followed by their inappropriate structure (n=14). The authors have identified many challenges related to the lack of oversight by regulatory bodies (n=14) as well as issues related to the ethical training of IEC members and investigators (n=13).

				<p>
					The most common solutions suggested focused on methods to improve the functioning of IECs (n=19),inputs to improve their structure (n=5), ways to strengthen the procedures for the training of IEC members/investigators (n=17), and strengthening the whole system by modifying or revising the guidelines laid down by the regulatory authorities (n=13). A few authors suggested solutions in the areas of societal concerns (n=4), conflicts of interest (COI) (n=2), and financial issues (n=5). We analysed these issues further.

					Many articles mention that as the majority of IEC members are from the medical field, the scientific aspects of studies are discussed at the committees' meetings and not enough attention is paid to ethical issues such as risk&ndash;benefit analysis, compensation, undue inducement, protection of vulnerable participants, the issue of distributive justice, provision of a proper standard of care, post-trial benefits, autonomy, the use of placebo, and obtaining and documenting consent <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Muthuswamy V.

					Another of the problems mentioned in the articles is that of sponsors putting pressure on the IEC to approve their project by arguing that the IECs of other institutes have already approved the project. Alternatively, instead of complying with the recommendations of the IEC, the sponsor moves the study to another site, which has a more "compliant" ethics committee <a class="reference" href="#twentythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cash R.

One of the suggestions for upgrading the review process entails the use of a checklist on a scale of 1&ndash;5, 1 being not serious and 5 being the most serious. This will ensure that all ethical issues are given a thought by the IEC members <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandiya A.

					No approval letter should be issued till the study has been registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), if applicable.

Some members do not have knowledge of the functioning of IECs and the Schedule Y/ICMR guidelines. Some do not even know the name of the regulatory body that oversees clinical trials in India. The factors that lead to such a situation are the absence of good clinical practice (GCP) and bioethics education, lack of resources, as well as a shortage of faculty to teach medical ethics <a class="reference" href="#twentynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran GD.

				<h4>Societal concerns</h4>
				<h5>Challenges</h5>
				<p>
					Studies on drugs and devices and the issues related to these need to be brought into the public domain so that the general population is aware of the facts.

					The IEC should ask the sponsors or investigators to mention how the tissue samples will be disposed of after the research has been completed.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					This paper summarises the challenges identified and solutions proposed with regard to the constitution and functioning of IECs in India. Over a period of nine years, we found 31 papers addressing these aspects. There are several common refrains (summarised in Table 1), pertaining mainly to the constitution of IECs, the quorum, lack of institutional support, absence of or inadequate training, non-participation of the non-technical members in deliberations, conflicts of interest, and the lack of regulatory oversight. The authors have put forward some interesting solutions, such as the mandatory certification of IEC members and registration of the IEC for a medical school to be recognised by the MCI.
				</p>
				<p>
					The notification making the registration of IECs mandatory <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. The Gazette of India, Part II-Section 3-Sub-section (i), Notification dated 8th February 2013. New Delhi: MoHFW; 2013 [cited 2014 Jun 8]. Available at: http://cdsco.nic.in/html/G.S.R%2072(E)%20dated%2008.02.2013.pdf" id="6">(6)</a> may result in a significant improvement in their structure and functioning. It is likely to help solve the problems in areas such as the composition of IECs, SOPs, schedule of meetings, quorum of meetings, the presence of legal experts and laypersons at meetings, documentation of IEC activities (including keeping the minutes of meetings), the regular use of GCP, and ethical training of IEC members. To date 586 IECs are registered with the CDSCO <a class="reference" href="#thirtyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation. Ethics committee registration [Internet]. New Delhi: CDSCO, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, updated May 12, 2014 [cited 2014 Jun 8]. Available from: http://www.cdsco.nic.in/forms/list.aspx?lid=1859&amp;Id=1" id="35">(35)</a>. However, the details of the constitution and functioning of these IECs are not available in the public domain. Certain measures such as compulsory monitoring of sites still need to be implemented by the DCGI and organisations such as the ICMR or FERCI.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is evident from the multitude of papers on the issue that the challenges related to the constitution and functioning of IECs must be given the attention they deserve to ensure that research participants in India are adequately protected.
