					On February 14, 1995, the Medical Service Centre of Karnataka State, organised a convention in Bangalore to discuss the problems arising from renal transplantation. The following excerpts have been taken from the resolution passed at the close of the meeting:
				</p>
				<p>
					'<em>This convention expresses its strong protest against the sale of human kidneys reported in the city and elsewhere.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'This convention expresses profound admiration and deep gratitude to all (those) whose priceless dedication and tireless work has made organ transplantation a reality, resulting in the saving of thousands of lives. At the same time we cannot but condemn the sale of organs and the crass commercialism (now bedeviling) this extraordinary achievement.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'We express our strong and indignant condemnation of the nefarious sale of organs not only because it goes against human dignity and medical ethics but also because concrete evidence has demonstrated beyond any shade of doubt that this practice has resulted in exploitation of the donor, exploitation of the recipient, poor quality of medical care, a negative impact on the progress of live, related transplant and cadaveric transplant and increasing foul play and crime.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'We note with shock and dismay the occasional voices from the higher echelons of our society subtly arguing in support of sale of organs. We cannot but reject their misplaced concern for a small section of rich and privileged patients who would benefit from the sale of organs which would irreparably damage the interests of society at large. Medical ethics cannot be perverted to benefit the few at the cost of the interests of humanity at large.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'This convention reiterates the view held by the World Health Organisation, the International Society of Transplant Surgeons and others that cadaveric transplants and those from live, related donors are the only medically and ethically acceptable procedures.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>'We ask the medical community to isolate its black sheep. Firm steps are needed to uphold medical ethics in a rapidly deteriorating situation. Only thus can we restore the cherished doctor-patient relationship.'</em>
