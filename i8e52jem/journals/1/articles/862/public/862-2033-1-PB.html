					In recent years, a  disturbing trend has crept into health policy. This trend is being seen not  only in India but also in the West. In fact, it appears that we are only  imitating this trend without considering the larger interests of our country  and society. This is the trend of prioritising the rights of some people or  patients over the rights of society at large. Ironically, this is being ushered  in under the garb of human rights, while it is actually compromising the  collective good for the convenience of a few. Whereas many within the  government and even among the intelligentsia are concerned about the negative  fallouts of such laws, the halo around the human rights concept has forced them  to be silent spectators to this retrogressive trend. The financial implications  of such an approach also need to be kept in mind. The belief that this  financial burden will not affect the poorer sections of the society, since it  will fall on the private health sector, is more than a myth. Seventy per cent  of the population in this country seeks medical help and even inpatient care  from the private sector.

				<h4>Harmful  law</h4>
				<p>
					The proposed Maharashtra  Clinical Establishment Act is in the stage of finalisation. The Act envisages  regularising the standards of health care in the state. The need to regularise  the standard of health care and establish certain basic norms cannot be  disputed. There are, however, certain contentious issues in the Act. For  example, one provision of the Act reads: 'the clinical establishment shall not  refuse admission of any patient suffering from HIV infection or AIDS.' This  provision may sound holistic but it is almost surely going to prove  retrogressive. It makes the rights of HIV-positive patients, for mysterious  reasons, more important than the rights of the rest of the population. Such a  turn-around in the approach to communicable diseases defies logic. Such a  legislation is likely to harm the normal population as well as the HIV-infected  one, besides causing inconvenience to clinical establishments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fallacies of such a  legislation are many. I list them below: The phrase 'right to admission to a  clinical establishment' is vague. There may be various reasons for which the  clinical establishment is unable to admit the patient. This provision seeks to  ensure health care to HIV-positive patients, for which there cannot be any  dispute. However, it completely overlooks the right and duty of the clinical  establishment to take a judicious decision according to the circumstances. For  example, the consultant of the relevant specialty may not be easily available,  there may be a shortage of beds, the patient may not be able to pay for the  expenses of the establishment, and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient may also be  harbouring communicable infections besides HIV, which may necessitate  isolation. Opportunistic infections in the immunocompromised host are known to  be very virulent and also resistant to standard treatment schedules. The  susceptibility of HIV-infected people to opportunistic fungal infections and  resistant varieties of tuberculosis-causing microorganisms, which do not  respond to the primary line of treatment, is well established. They would thus  infect the normal population if not adequately protected or isolated, and even  non-HIV-infected patients would get infected with these virulent infections,  necessitating a secondary line of treatment. Such isolation may not be  possible every time in small establishments.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no doubt about  the need to take special precautions while handling such a patient due to the  possibility of infection to the health care worker and also transmission to  other patients. The argument that all patients should be treated as if they are  HIV positive is unreasonable because that would send health care costs shooting  up astronomically. One disposable kit used for the operative treatment of an  HIV-positive patient costs approximately Rs 1,300. Even a minor surgery  requires a minimum of three such kits. This will increase the cost of all  surgeries by about Rs 5,000.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the HIV status of the  patient is not known, the treatment plan cannot be formulated because most such  patients are likely to be resistant to routine antibiotics, and precious time  may be lost while treating them with the primary line of treatment. How will a  clinician decide the level of aggression he has to use for the opportunistic  infections in these patients without knowing their HIV status?
				</p>
				<p>
					At times, the patient  may be better treated in a specialised set-up where it may be possible to  monitor such patients more effectively, especially in the presence of virulent  infections. Often, for reasons of their own convenience or the  short-sightedness of relatives, they may not heed medical advice. Such  relatives may now be able to impose their conveniences over the good of the  patient himself.

				<h4>Short-cut  policies</h4>
				<p>
					HIV infection is a  social problem and laws have a limited role in its eradication. Experiences  with similar such problems as the Dowry Prevention Act, which has been  blatantly violated by a large section of society, are proof of the futility of  such laws and the ineffectiveness of the legal processes. Medical  establishments could (and should) be encouraged to look at these patients  sympathetically. They should be relied on to render medical advice in the best  interests of the patient and society. Social commitments cannot be enforced  legally. HIV-positive patients would be better served by intensifying the  efforts on the ground level to facilitate the treatment of these patients,  creating awareness to prevent their ostracisation, and promoting efforts to  control the spread of this disease at the earliest. Short-cut policies will  only serve self-seeking policing authorities. The discriminatory attitude of  the bureaucracy of this country is obvious by the fact that the various  professional indemnity policies offered to doctors and medical establishments  by state-owned insurance companies specifically do not cover the treatment of  HIV-positive patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Independent India's  history of more than 50 years has documented that the policies of reservation  have only served the self-seeking promoters of these policies. They have done  little to help the lot for whom these reservations were designed. The  intelligentsia and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) need to learn from this.  An increasing number of laws and control on private health care will be  detrimental not only to the welfare of the medical community but also to the  more needy sections of society. Private clinical establishments in our country  are self-financed, non-aided institutions. The rising costs of  health care infrastructure have already overburdened them financially and their  economic survival is under threat. Their financial depletion will lead either  to their closure or their seeking supplementary and tangential methods of  income. Either scenario would be detrimental to the health care of the  community.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fabric of health  care is delicate, even in the most well-developed economies of the world.  Soaking it in the muck of vendetta, abnormal levies or unrealistic expectations  would only make it more friable. There is an urgent need for progressive,  realistic and honest legislation to protect the health of the country. We plead  with the Maharashtra government for its preliminary efforts to evolve a  consensus on the Clinical Establishment Act. Suggestions have been made by the  medical and anti-medical community. Hopefully, wiser counsel and pragmatism  will prevail in the final draft of this Act.
