				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					This is a review of the manner in which the Revised National
					Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is being implemented,
					with a focus on the attention being paid to ethical principles
					and the incorporation of these into the programme. The article
					elucidates how ethical principles can be applied to protect the
					rights of the potential beneficiaries of the RNTCP. The authors
					consider the RNTCP in the light of a framework that is usually
					applied in research to evaluate ethical principles in public health
					practice. The three key principles of the framework are: respect for
					persons, beneficence and justice. The authors propose that this
					framework be used to make an ethical evaluation of other pu
					health programmes at several levels, since this could bring farreaching
					benefits to society.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Public health professionals constantly face ethical dilemmas
					in their practice. Moral standards that distinguish right from
					wrong are based on societal prescriptions, philosophy, values
					and religious beliefs. Some of these are transmuted into ethical
					guidelines set by professional bodies. Respect for persons,
					beneficence (subsuming non-maleficence) and justice form
					the trinity of principles that comprises one of the most widely
					prevalent frameworks to guide ethical behaviour: principlism.
					There is often an implicit expectation that such principles and
					frameworks be integrated into the design and implementation
					of public health programmes <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Roberts MJ, Reich MR. Ethical analysis in public health. Lancet. 2002 Mar 23;359(9311):1055-9." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is usually easier to take a clear ethical position in extreme
					cases, such as that of a patient's death following gross
					negligence by medical practitioners or the deliberate and
					prolonged lack of response to a public health need by
					the authorities. However, it is more difficult to take a clear
					position in cases in which injustice or exploitation may not be
					immediately apparent or explicit, for instance, if a child dies or is
					disabled as a result of adverse events following immunisation.
					A clear understanding of ethical principles can aid in the
					resolution of such dilemmas <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hodge JG, Jr, Gostin LO.

				<h4>Objective</h4>
				<p>
					The purpose of this paper is to examine a framework of ethical
					principles often applied in the context of research - respect for persons, beneficence and justice - and explore its applicability
					to public health practice. Specifically, we utilise this framework
					to critically examine the Revised National Tuberculosis Control
					Programme (RNTCP) in India from the perspective of ethics.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					We studied the published literature, reports of ongoing national
					programmes and documents outlining ethical principles
					that have been published by international organisations

				</p>
				<p>
					We evaluated the current public health programmes on
					the basis of the three principles mentioned above. The
					violation of any of the principles in the framework was seen
					as a programmatic deficiency or weak point (Figure 1). The
					principles are outlined briefly below.
				</p>
				<p>
					Respect for persons (also referred to as autonomy) implies
					that the choices of autonomous individuals are respected,
					individuals incapable of making their own choices are
					protected, and informed decision-making is facilitated through
					adequate provision of information (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki.

					has also been used in the context of the need to pay attention
					to the requirements and expectations of communities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The term justice, in the context of public health programmes,
					implies that individuals and communities should not be
					exploited, selection for participation in health programmes
					must be fair, and vulnerable individuals who may benefit shall
					not be excluded without good reason (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki.

				</p>
				<p>
					Beneficence (subsuming non-maleficence) mandates that
					participation in any public health programme should be
					associated with a favourable risk-benefit ratio. Thus, public
					health interventions should maximise the possible benefits
					while minimising potential harm (<a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki.

				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					The RNTCP is the country's premier vertical programme for
					the control of tuberculosis (TB). As per the standard definition
					in infectious epidemiology, the source population for the
					detection of TB is expected to include all those who are at
					risk of acquiring TB infection. Hence, the rates of incidence of TB should reflect new infections or new cases of active
					TB <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rothman KJ, Greenland S, Lash TL. Modern epidemiology, 3rd edition. Philladelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2008." id="10">(10)</a>. However, according to the earlier definition used by
					the RNTCP and endorsed by the World Health Organisation
					(WHO), detection rates should have the number of new "smearpositive"
					patients detected each year as the numerator, which is
					operationally convenient and practically feasible <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chauhan LS, Agarwal SP. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme. In: Chauhan LS, Agarwal SP, editors. Tuberculosis control in India. New Delhi: Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and FamilyWelfare; 2005, pp. 23-34." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use of the earlier definition led to an inaccurate estimation of
					the incidence of TB for the reasons highlighted below. First, it did
					not include new cases alone, but any case, including prevalent
					cases (old but not detected). <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rothman KJ, Greenland S, Lash TL. Modern epidemiology, 3rd edition. Philladelphia, PA: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2008." id="102">(10)</a> Second, detection rates
					may not be expected to truly reflect all new cases, since not
					all patients with new infections or active TB visit a doctor and
					get diagnosed. In certain regions in low- and middle-income
					countries, the expectation of a 100% detection rate, predicated
					on the assumption that all TB-infected individuals would be
					diagnosed in primary health centres or clinics, is overambitious
					and, in fact, unrealistic. Third, the fallacious notion that smearpositivity
					is indispensable to accurate case detection allows
					smear-negative TB infections to go unrecorded (<a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Begum V, Van Der Werf MJ, BecxBleumink M, Borgdorff MW. Viewpoint: do we have enough data to estimate the current burden of tuberculosis? The example of Bangladesh. Trop Med Int Health. 2007;12(3):317-22." id="12">12</a>, <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Van Der Werf MJ, Borgdorff MW. How to measure the prevalence of tuberculosis in a population. Trop Med Int Health. 2007;12(4):475-84." id="13">13</a>). It should
					also be borne in mind that most widely used diagnostic tests
					today, such as sputum microscopy, are often not completely
					effective in the detection of TB.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, though the programme intends to detect the incidence
					of TB in the country, it is actually determining the prevalence of
					TB among patients who happen to visit a healthcare centre and
					test smear-positive. Operational reasons underlie the change of
					nomenclature whereby prevalence has been termed incidence,
					and the technical soundness of this definition is a cause for
					concern. There are several dangers associated with such a
					change. One, it gives rise to a false sense of complacency that
					all new cases (incident cases) are being diagnosed, whereas
					in reality, a significant proportion of the population with new
					infections is not diagnosed, leading to under-reporting of
					cases. The current incidence measures depend on several
					determinants. These determinants are: varying detection
					rates across different regions/states; varying levels of sputum
					positivity after detection by clinicians; and different reporting
					patterns within the same region over a period of time. Further,
					only the survivors of active/chronic TB figure in each of these
					estimates, with those who are already dead due to the severity
					of disease or lack of treatment being left out <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Attaran A. An immeasurable crisis? A criticism of the millennium development goals and why they cannot be measured. PLoS Medicine. 2005;2(10):e318. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020318" id="14">(14)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					TB chemotherapy is intended primarily to decrease the
					prevalence of the disease (diagnosed and existing cases)
					rather than its incidence, since it is undertaken subsequent to
					diagnosis and not vice versa. What would ideally bring down
					the incidence, which is the stated focus of the RNTCP, are
					preventive measures rather than therapeutic measures. A few
					examples of preventive measures are: improvements in lifestyle
					through programmes aimed at providing well-ventilated
					housing with adequate space between the units, so that
					fewer people are compelled to live in crowded settlements;
					controlling immunodeficiency; and the introduction of
					effective vaccines, once they are available.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key underlying ethical issue here is that the basic definition
					of TB cases hinges around programmatic convenience, geared
					as it is towards calculating an estimate, and fails to effectively
					prioritise and address the goal of identifying all TB infections
					and providing treatment to them. Furthermore, the RNTCP
					has no focus whatsoever on prevention, a key requirement for
					reducing the disease burden. It is completely unethical to term
					prevalence cases as incidence cases, a practice which results in
					a marginal reduction of TB cases and therefore, allows for the
					false declaration that the burden of new disease has fallen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ethical principle of respect for persons is violated because
					the public and policy-makers are given either only partial or
					no information on which to base decisions on whether the
					programme is truly reducing the incidence of TB or is largely
					concerned with decreasing the prevalence of TB cases. A
					detailed paper by Nair in this journal <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Porter J, Ogden JA. Ethics of directly observed therapy for the control of infectious diseases. Bulletin de l'Institut Pasteur. 1997;95(3):117-27." id="15">(15)</a> lists several ethical
					issues concerning the RNTCP. It reports that 90% of patients
					who suffer from TB are not given any scientific treatment, while
					87% of patients who are diagnosed and treated on the basis of
					an X-ray alone are unlikely to have TB.
				</p>
				<p>
					All member states of the WHO adopted the goal of detecting
					at least 70% of all new infectious cases arising each year, and of
					curing at least 85% of those detected by 2000 (later changed
					to 2015) <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Forty-fourth World Health Assembly. Resolutions and Decisions. Resolution WHA 44.8[Internet]. Geneva:WHO;1991[cited 2013 Nov 18]. Available from: http://www. who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/09-070169/en/" id="16">(16)</a>. The UN Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6c,
					related to decreasing the incidence of TB, can be approached in
					either of the following ways.
				</p>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>
						Define cases of TB to actually reflect the entire population
						that is at risk and determine detection rates on such a
						definition. This entails improvements in detection and
						reporting. It is impossible to achieve this without effecting
						improvements in public health surveillance, and addressing
						challenges in the management of human resources
						and infrastructure so as to maximise the reach of the TB
						programme.
					</li>
					<li>
						Continue with the current definition of incidence and
						conclude that TB is under control. If one adopts the latter
						approach, one would tend to embrace a more vertical
						programme at the risk of neglecting the primary health
						infrastructure as well as the improvement of the health
						systems (Table 1).
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					It is possible for low- and middle-income countries to realise
					the MDG related to the control of TB only if their public health
					infrastructure undergoes a dramatic improvement. This should
					ideally be the primary long-term goal not only of programmes
					aimed at TB control, but also of many other contemporary
					public health programmes addressing the several health
					problems plaguing these countries. The use of simple and
					more practical epidemiological tools can help eliminate the
					uncertainties in the measurement of the disease burden and
					its impact on the population, and also, eliminate the false sense
					of accomplishment, which can lead to complacency <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Babu GR. Comment on 'From risk factors to explanation in public health'. J Public Health. 2008;30(4):515-16." id="17">(17)</a>. It is
					recommended that population measures of disease, such as
					incidence and prevalence, be better defined in the context of the implementation of the TB programme. There should also be
					greater clarity on which aspects of the disease measures are to
					be addressed. This will help tackle the problem of unjustifiable
					declarations that there has been a reduction in TB cases.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Drug-resistant forms of TB</h4>
				<p>
					Another key issue that the RNTCP aims to deal with is the
					incidence of drug-resistant forms of TB. The various forms of
					drug resistance (MDR-TB, XDR-TB and more recently, the socalled
					XXDR-TB or TDR-TB) have made it more critical than
					ever to effectively identify, assess and treat incident TB cases so
					that the incidence of TB can be halted and reversed by 2015, to
					meet the MDG. By increasing the propensity to cause incident
					cases of TB, and also increasing the programme's expenditure
					on diagnosis and treatment, drug-resistant TB clearly poses
					a serious obstacle to the complete eradication of TB from the
					country.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to be aware that the same factors that
					contribute to the spread of TB and lead to more incident cases
					also contribute to drug resistance. These include the fact that
					all patients do not have adequate access to proper treatment.
					Further, there is a lack of clinical follow-up of patients to ensure
					adherence to short-course chemotherapy. The poor utilisation
					and limitations of diagnostic procedures is another factor.
					Most importantly, there is the issue of the disorganised private
					healthcare sector, the association of which with the nationallevel
					public healthcare programme is not supervised or guided
					in any particular direction <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Babu GR, Laxminarayan R. The unsurprising story of MDR-TB resistance in India. Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2012 Jul;92(4):301-6. doi: 10.1016/j. tube.2012.02.009" id="18">(18)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this context, there is a breach of the ethical principle of
					beneficence. All the efforts of a public health programme such
					as the RNTCP would not result in any long-term achievements
					in disease control and eradication in the absence of better
					and periodical assessment of the incidence of drug resistance,
					drastic improvements in the healthcare infrastructure, and a
					clear foundation upon which to base the implementation of
					measures that prevent the spread of disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					The DOTS-Plus programme has been in place as part of the
					RNTCP since the year 2000, to address some of the issues
					relating to drug resistance. Its increasing coverage of the
					disease across the country has led to significant improvements
					in the rates of the detection of TB <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Empowered Procurement Wing, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Government of India. RNTCP Launches Cat IV (DOTS Plus) treatment for Multi-Drug Resistant TB [Tuberculosis Control Program][Internet]. New Delhi: Government of India 2013 [updated June 26 2013][cited 2013 Nov 20]. Available from: http://mohfw-epw.gov.in/index.php?option=com_ content&view=article&id=68:rntcp-launches-cat-iv-dots-plustreatment- for-multi-drug-resistant-tb&catid=46:facts-a-figures" id="19">(19)</a>, However, the
					programme has not been modified to rectify the prior errors
					in the management of the disease. Bringing India's extensive
					private healthcare sector, which comprises clinicians, private
					diagnostic facilities and traditional healers, into a single,
					cohesive public health programme may seem a tough, even
					impossible, task. However, unless this sector is utilised as a
					potential resource in a national public health programme such
					as the RNTCP, and unless guidelines are established to improve
					the sector's integration into the programme, little progress can
					be made in assessing and treating drug-resistant forms of TB
					across the country. While the RNTCP has made some positive
					inroads into this area, much more needs to be done by way of
					providing an integrated and comprehensive response for TB
					control.

				<h4>Pointers for the future</h4>
				<p>
					The Belmont Report was commissioned in the USA in response
					to a large number of unethical biomedical research cases,
					and has greatly influenced the development of the field of
					biomedical research ethics globally. This is reflected in growing
					attention in India and other low-and-middle-income countries.
					Due to a variety of factors, ethical concerns in public health
					programmes often do not receive the same extent of coverage
					as the ethical aspects of biomedical research/clinical trials.
					First, public health programmes are rarely required to obtain
					ethical clearance before their implementation, particularly in
					low- and middle-income countries. Second, there are only a
					few ethical frameworks that have been specifically developed
					for application to public health programmes, and these are
					not widely known. Third, there is a perception among the
					health managers that they are doing the public good by
					implementing the public health programme and hence, minor
					aberrations or side-effects that affect a few individuals are
					tolerable (if not justified). That they harbour good intentions
					towards the public is mistaken for being ethical, and in many cases, programme managers do not even examine whether
					there is a need for ethical review and monitoring. This article
					has attempted to draw attention to examples of violations
					of the ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence
					and justice. At times, proactive measures need to be taken in
					research, in preference to reactive measures to gross violations.
					We hypothesise that using pre-emptive ethical screening for
					the development and implementation of health programmes
					might help to limit possible violations.

						Fig. 2: Ensuring implementation of ethical framework
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					The implementation of any new public health programme
					should be guided by consultations with ethicists, public health
					consultants, scientific organisations and the general public.
					The programme should be discussed by various stakeholders,
					including the people's representatives in the media and
					forums for generating awareness among the people. There
					should be standard operating procedures (SOPs) for seeking
					ethical approval for new programmes. The SOPs should focus
					on improving the quality of services, monitoring the adverse effects of the programme, maintaining a registry of grievances,
					supporting people affected by adverse effects, and addressing
					misconceptions about the programme. As a first step, the
					existing public health programmes can be reviewed on the
					basis of this framework (Table 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					An example of an ethical framework within which a public
					health programme should function is illustrated in Figure 2. We
					stress the need to bring the science of public health to the level
					of lay persons so that they understand it well enough to make
					decisions, at an individual, family and community level, about
					whether or not to avail themselves of public health services.
					One of the important challenges to the implementation of
					ethical frameworks is the mindset of health managers and
					those who make policies on healthcare. Currently, in low- and
					middle-income countries, those framing health policies often
					assume the role of decision-makers on behalf of the people
					("for their good"). We argue that where possible, concerted
					efforts should be made to encourage decision-making (with respect to accepting or rejecting public health interventions) at
					the individual and community level by the people themselves,
					and health managers should facilitate this. We believe that
					implementing ethical frameworks would make the focus of
					public health programmes more "user-friendly", rather than
					"management-friendly", as they are at present.

				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<p>
					In this paper, we have examined the applicability of the
					principles of respect for persons, beneficence and justice to
					the implementation of the TB control programme in India. We
					applied these principles, which have primarily been used as
					a framework for evaluating research on human participants,
					in the context of public health policy and programme
					implementation in the country (Figure 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					Numerous ethical dilemmas must be confronted in the
					area of public health practice in the modern world (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Attaran A. An immeasurable crisis? A criticism of the millennium development goals and why they cannot be measured. PLoS Medicine. 2005;2(10):e318. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020318" id="142">14</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Detels R.

Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press; 1999, pp. 485-91." id="20">20</a>).
					Governments and international agencies are sometimes
					successful in addressing these dilemmas during the
					implementation of public health programmes. However, we
					argue that most ethical violations may be prevented if ethical
					frameworks are adopted before implementation. We propose
					the application of one such framework, consisting of the
					principles of respect for persons, beneficence and justice, as
					adapted to public health practice, to serve as an ethical guide
					in the implementation of public health programmes. These
					principles should be shared with policy-makers and used
					during decision-making in public health programmes. We have
					presented an ethical evaluation of the TB control programme
					in India as an example. Similarly, an ethical evaluation of all
					the proposed and ongoing public health programmes at the
					national and international levels can make an incremental
					positive difference in the lives of the people.
