					The kidney transplant controversy continues. The  licences of most of the hospitals in Karnataka have expired recently and the  state is doing a re-think on its policy. What this means is that, at the  moment, renal transplants cannot be performed in the state. Even those who have  been given permission by the authorisation committees are in limbo as the  hospitals do not currently have the permission to perform the surgery.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I do not know much about the intricacies of  the formation of such committees and changes of policy, surely the state should  have woken up much earlier if at all they wished to address the issue of ethics  and transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some years ago, when I was on the verge of leaving  for the USA, I was warned by a friend, "I know someone who knows someone  who knows someone (ad infinitum) who was invited for a drink by a stranger in a  bar in [the city that I was going to visit] . He accepted the generous offer.  The next thing he knew was waking up in a bathtub of ice in a strange hotel. A  note taped to his body informed him to contact a doctor immediately as his  kidney [or was it kidneys?] had just been removed surgically for purposes of  transplant. The episode had too many holes in it for me to believe it and  subsequently, it was shown to be a fraudulent story (too many cities involved,  too many people who knew people,...but no one with first hand knowledge). This  story however can be transplanted [sic!] to India with considerably better  success.
				</p>

					The local newspapers report that in January 1999, a  young man called Shiva who donated his kidney to an unrelated recipient in a  private hospital for 'altruistic' reasons was murdered a week later. The tout  involved persuaded Shiva to 'donate' his kidney for Rs 45,000, which would go  towards buying an autorickshaw. A week after surgery, on his discharge from  hospital, Shiva was murdered by a contract killer, hired by the tout,  Gangadharaiah &ndash; for Rs 5,000. So we now have it on record. A kidney is more  precious than human life in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					While investigating this incident, police have  stumbled across another similar episode. Doubtless, there will be many more.  This is exactly the slippery slope that opponents of euthanasia warn about. In  a nation where it is easy to break laws and get away with it, it is easy to  imagine what can happen with slippery slopes. Remember, no-one has even  mentioned this slippery slope of renal transplantation.

					Karnataka's minister for higher education and  medical education, G Parameshwara, states that the government plans to introduce  a comprehensive medical syllabus to include the ayurvedic system of medicine.  Apparently, "the merits of including ayurveda in allopathy course and allopathy  in ayurveda courses will be discussed." Doubtless, committee after committee  will be set up to look into the feasibility of this brainwave. I trust someone  will inform the minister about cross-practice not being allowed as per the  highest court in the land. And exactly how much ayurveda will the allopath  learn, and vice versa? Wasn't Alexander Pope referring to just this when he  wrote, "A little learning is a dangerous thing"?

					As I write this letter, I learn about the latest controversy to hit the medical  world. The New England Journal of Medicine, which is perhaps the most  influential medical journal in the USA, and therefore in the world, has changed  its editorial policy with respect to conflict-of-interest statements. Because,  apparently, the editors find it practically impossible to find physicians (to  write or review articles on drugs) with no financial contacts with the  pharmaceutical industry, they have changed the statement from: "Because  the essence of reviews and editorials is selection and interpretation of the  literature, the <em>Journal</em> expects that authors of such articles will not have any  financial interest in a company (or its competitor) that makes a product  discussed in the article," to one which says "...will not have any <em>significant</em> financial interest..." [italics mine]. It is good, in the interest  of transparency, to have a conflict-of-interest statement and policy along with  the published article. But how many of us, at least in India, seriously study  such statements, or question their importance?
				</p>
				<p>
					How this will affect medical practice is to be  seen. However, it is difficult to think of any positive benefit from such a  move.
				</p>
				<p>
					No such fears for Indian medical editors, though. Some time ago, I received an  e-mail from a respected journalist asking for my views and comments on certain  aspects of medical journalism. Her project was centred around an episode that  she had learnt of : a prominent Indian physician had sent a paper for  publication to a well-known Indian medical journal with a large circulation. He  soon received a letter from the journal, requesting him to place an  advertisement for an organisation that he was also involved with. The doctor  wrote back asking if it meant that placing an advertisement would result in his  article getting accepted for publication. "Yes," came back the reply!  I do not know what happened next, but presumably, the journalist knows and will  write it up in her article.
