				<h4>Problems with private pathology practice</h4>
				<p>
					I have read the article  entitled 'Why I don't believe in referral commissions' by Arun Sheth <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheth A. Why I don't believe in referral commissions. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:58-59." id="1">(1)</a>. What  struck me as odd about this piece was the fact that we now need to justify the  'right thing to do'. The very fact that doctors who don't give or take 'cuts'  are a minority nowadays speaks badly enough of our 'noble' profession. But that  we now need to find reasons and justifications for doing the proper things is  truly a serious cause for introspection. It appears that a wrong done over and  over again by a large number of people, and highly educated people at that,  soon becomes the order of the day. Hence, doctors who 'don't fall in line' risk  greater marginalisation from the mainstream. They take too long to  establish themselves and some finally just give up and change professions. This  is especially true for people like us who have dependent practices like  pathology.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's look at some facts in the pathology 'business'. Technician-run  laboratories are prepared to go to any lengths to secure their 'business'.  Although it is degrading for qualified pathologists to compete with  technicians, there is no other way because even top consultants accept these  reports (sometimes even unsigned ones) from technicians. We even have a few  technicians requesting us to report their peripheral smears or cytologies or  even biopsies which means that even these investigations are sent to  technicians' labs and not to pathologists. The flip side is that when it comes  to the consultant's own relatives or friends they always come to a pathologist  even for the simplest of tests. What's good enough for other patients is not so  for the doctor's kith and kin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consortium-owned labs or group practice set-ups are the 'in' thing. Here,  doctors invest money together in a diagnostic set-up and then send long lists  of investigations for kickbacks and incentives. (From the layperson's point of  view this is viewed as hunting in packs.) I think the main issue here is the  percentage receivable, rather than what is necessary for the patient. It is one  thing to make a project viable, quite another to burden the patient for your  personal gain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then comes the choice of the patient to go to any lab. Due to the nexus that  exists between the clinics and labs, unless a patient comes back with a report  from a particular lab, he is subjected to another battery of tests with the  explanation, 'These tests are wrong; why didn't you go to the other lab?' The  poor patient fears the wrath of the doctor and does as he is told, in the  process compromising his right to choose where he wants to go.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have even heard of places where rickshawallahs and drugstore owners are roped  in to direct patients. This absolutely unethical way of 'soliciting clients'  just proves to what lengths we are now ready to go to succeed in our  profession. It is even more depressing to think how the big reference labs have  affected small private set-ups like mine to compete with their prices,  especially when nobody cares about the quality of reports that these labs have  to offer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, it is becoming very difficult to practise pathology in a clean manner. It  is the patient who is being taken for granted all the time. I have managed so  far to keep myself away from these practices but always get an 'explanation'  from my male colleagues that it's because I am a woman and don't have to  'support' a family. I think we must take steps to create a space for ethical  doctors to be able to earn a living while practising their professions with  dignity and self-respect. In this, I feel the National Accreditation Body for  Laboratories must play an important role and laboratories must be licensed and  accredited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, to those who wish to practise market-medicine, I wish you much  happiness in your endeavours. But remember what Gibbon said: 'The first  and indispensable requisite of happiness is a clear conscience, unsullied by  the reproach or remembrance of an unworthy action.'
