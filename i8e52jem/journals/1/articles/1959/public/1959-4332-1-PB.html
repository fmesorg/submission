				<h4>Humanities in medical  education</h4>
				<p>
					The section 'From other journals' in the January-March 1997 issue (<em>Issues in Medical  Ethics </em>Vol. 5, No. 1)  contained a reference to the introduction of the humanities into medical  education. Specifically, the item mentioned the use of poetry on medical rounds  with residents, as described by Horowitz in <em>The Lancet </em>1996: 347: 447-449.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Dr. Horowitz's efforts are laudable and  no doubt of value to his residents, readers of your journal should be aware  that what Dr. Horowitz describes is extremely modest and limited compared to  the extensive and sophisticated humanities curricula that have been firmly  integrated into many U. S. medical schools for thirty years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indeed, the first such programme at any  medical sohool was introduced at the Penn State University College of Medicine,  where a full academic Department of Humanities was established in 1967. Since  that time, the disciplines of the medical humanities -- ethics, law,  literature, cultural studies, history, philosophy, and religious studies --  have been added to the faculties and required curricula at a large number of  schools.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your readers will find the best current review  of the state of the art in the humanities in medical education in a special  issue of the journal <em>Academic Medicine</em>, Vol. 70, No. 9 (September, 1995). The principal professional  society for teachers and scholars in the medical humanities, with over 800  members, is the Society for Health and Human Values, 6728 Old McLean Village  Drive, McLean, Virginia 22101) U S A (E-mail: <a href="mailto:shhv@aol.com">shhv@aol.com</a>). All interested  persons would be welcome to join. I certainly hope this information will be of  interest.
