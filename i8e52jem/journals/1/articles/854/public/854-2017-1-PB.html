				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Enlargement of people's  choices is one form of human development <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="UNDP. Human Development Report 1990. New York: Oxford University Press, 1990." id="1">(1)</a>. To this extent, biotechnology as  a treatment option for certain human ailments such as genetic disorders can be  taken as an effort towards human development, as it definitely extends the  range of choices available to the public. The issue of 'taking biotechnology to  the patient' goes beyond mere technology development, which is a supply side  activity that may not take into account the demand side requirements such as  accessibility and affordability-two important attributes for the success of any  intervention technique.
				</p>
				<p>
					Availability in plenty  of any commodity or technology has favourable implications for accessibility  and affordability. However, healthcare devices/technologies differ from other  economic commodities/services and are exemptions to the market rule  'higher the supply lower the price'. One witnesses the co-existence of high  supply, poor access and high price in the field of medical care. Perhaps,  supply creates its own (induced) demand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients would be better  off if the new healthcare technology is more effective and less expensive  compared to the existing alternative technology. Taking it to the patients  would result in health gains and resource savings. Alternatively, patients  would be worse off if the new technology is less effective but more expensive  than the existing one, as it would result in health losses besides eating away  resources meant for alternative uses.
				</p>
				<p>
					There would be a dilemma  if the effectiveness of the new technology is unknown and uncertain and whose  cost is not comparable with any existing technologies. Technologies such as  genetic treatment of disorders like beta-thalassaemia fall under this category.  Such technologies are costly and their full benefits are not really  quantifiable <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Behl R. Taking biotechnology to the patient. Kumarakom: Indo-Canadian Genomic Policy Executive Course, 2003." id="2">(2)</a> When a treatment increases cost, there is no explicit  scientific or ethical definition of an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Oliver A, Healey A, Donaldson C.

				<h4>Public  choice</h4>
				<p>
					Should the government  allow, promote or provide such technology? The answer to the first part of the  question, i.e. allowing the technology, is 'yes' and the government can allow  it because the technology in question is more effective than the existing  one(s). What is hidden here is that it is not harmful to the patients who would  undergo such treatment. Taking this technology to the patients simply means  marketability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The answer to the second  part, i.e. promoting the technology, can be 'yes' or 'no' depending upon the  prevalence of the disease condition for which the new technology is developed,  or whether or not the technology fits into the essential clinical service  package. If the disease in question is highly prevalent and/or the technology  fits into the essential package, the government can promote it even if the technology  is actually delivered by the private sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The technology  accessible and affordable to patients. Duty exemption, cheap financing, bulk  purchase by the government, insurance and subsidy can all make. On the  contrary, if the disease for which the new technology provides solace is not  widely prevalent or the technology does not fit into the essential service  package, then the government does not have any justification to actively  promote it. The third part, i.e. government providing the technology, is a  complex one. There is no 'golden rule' concerning cost-effectiveness of  government healthcare services. Moreover, there are measurement problems with  respect to both cost and effectiveness of various healthcare interventions.  Healthcare is often a joint product of multiple facilities and an estimate of  the real cost may be rendered tricky. Similarly, the effectiveness of some  healthcare interventions is not strictly comparable although utility measures  such as quality adjusted life-years (QALY) and disability adjusted life-years  (DALY) provide some basis for comparison. The government should provide only  such healthcare that has public good (non-excludable and non-rival) or merit  good (existence of information asymmetry) characteristics. These two terminologies  are not well defined in practice either. Hence, the government should decide  whether or not to provide the technology on a case-by-case basis. The decision  under this circumstance becomes partly political-a comparison of the gain of  investing in the new treatment with what would be given up (opportunity cost)  by funding it. The UK, for instance, has established the National Institute of  Clinical Excellence (NICE), which requires manufacturers or sponsors of  healthcare interventions to submit evidence on the clinical- and  cost-effectiveness of many products and services <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Oliver A, Healey A, Donaldson C.

				<h4>Private  choice</h4>
				<p>
					Technologies such as the  cure for genetic disorders have the potential to make people 'sick' of higher  expenditure, that too for an uncertain return. Since such interventions take  away resources from alternative interventions/uses, total disease burden in the  society may rather increase because resources available for cure of other  illnesses are actually reduced. Even if the treatment works, one patient may  get treated at the cost of two or more patients (with the same or other  illnesses). Thus, the ultimate choice of the household in allocating resources  for such ailments would depend on the relative 'value' of the sick individual  within the household. The financing pattern of households to treat major  ailments suggests that 29%-42% of people borrow money, 2%-5% sell assets,  15%-30% use past savings and only 15%-20% people use the current income <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Government of India. Draft Tenth Five-Year Plan 2002- 2007. New Delhi: Indian Planning Commission, 2002." id="4">(4)</a>.  That is, seeking treatment for major illnesses induces financial burden on  one-third of the population, denies investment in the case of one-fourth and  eats away consumption resources in the case of one-fifth. These figures,  however, do not indicate the number of people denied care. Hence, households  too are exposed to numerous dilemmas in making personal choices.

				<h4>The  example of beta-thalassaemia</h4>
				<p>
					Beta-thalassaemia or  Cooley's anaemia is an inherited disorder that affects the production of normal  haemoglobin <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="http://www.lpch.org/DiseasesHealthInfo/HealthLibrary/hematology/thalbeta.html" id="5">(5)</a> Treatment options for beta thalassemia are:6 (i)  regular blood transfusions; (ii) medications (chelation therapy); (iii)  surgical removal of the spleen; (iv) daily doses of folic acid; (v) bone marrow  transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cost of bone marrow  transplantation (BMT) is about Rs 0.6-1.2 million <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Behl R. Taking biotechnology to the patient. Kumarakom: Indo-Canadian Genomic Policy Executive Course, 2003." id="2">(2)</a>. A person has a 5%-15%  chance that the transplant will not work and a 5%-20% chance of dying from  complications of the transplant <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Karimov A, Asadov C. The crisis of beta thalassemia in Azerbaijan. http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/34_folder/34_articles/34_thalassemia.html. Azerbaijan International, 1995." id="7">(7)</a>. Adjusting for failures and deaths, a  person has a 65%-90% chance of getting cured. The effective cost of treatment  per patient, given a 65% chance of cure, can be estimated a s Rs 0.9-1.9  million, while it is Rs 0.7-1.3 million for a 90% success rate. Given the fact  that only 25%-30% of the patients are likely to find suitable donors, only  16,250-27,000 out of an estimated 100,000 patients in the country can be  effectively treated. The total cost of treating 16,250-27,000 patients can be  estimated as Rs 11.4 billion (Rs 0.7 million x 16,250)-Rs 51.3 billion (Rs 1.9  million x 27,500).
				</p>
				<p>
					India has a wide range  of options to consider if it wants to utilise the money (Rs 11.4-51.3 billion)  cost-effectively. One of them is to use the entire money for the treatment of  beta-thalassaemia through BMT. The second option is to utilise the money to  provide an essential clinical service package to a part of the population or to  treat high prevalence diseases that have cost-effective treatment options. The  cost of providing essential service to one person is estimated as US$ 8  (approximately Rs 384) <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Bank. World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health. Washington D.C.: The World Bank,1994." id="8">(8)</a>. It means that India, if it is left with the option  of utilizing Rs 11.4-51.3 billion cost-effectively, can provide an essential  clinical service package to 29.7-133.6 million of the population. The option  would be either to treat 27,000 patients for beta-thalassaemia saving 0.27  million life-years (assuming a survival period of 10 years) or provide an  essential service package to 13.4 million people for 10 years. While the cost  of saving one year of life is Rs 0.07-0.19 million for BMT, the cost is  estimated as Rs 288 for AIDS education through media in Guinea <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jha P, Ranson K, Babadilla JL. Measuring the burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of health interventions: a case study in Guinea. Washington D.C.: The World Bank, Technical paper no. 333; 1996." id="9">(9)</a>. That is,  with the same resources that save a year of life using BMT, the country can save  243-660 years of life through alternative interventions. The country may thus  be benefited more if it provides AIDS education than treating beta-thalassaemia  through BMT. There exist thousands of competing healthcare interventions  addressing tens of thousands of ailments and BMT and beta-thalassaemia should  be treated as one among them-nothing more, nothing less.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should India discourage  the use of such technologies in general? The choice can be left to households  as long as it does not have harmful effects on patients. The role of the  government is to facilitate such treatment options to those who are willing and  able to pay for them and to regulate the choices that are available to the  people.
