					Omar  Swartz <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Swartz O. Access to AIDS medicines: ethical considerations. Indian J Med Ethics 2004; 1: 75-6." id="1">(1)</a> presents a number of good arguments in favour of treating the  formulae for making human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other life-saving  drugs as public goods rather than private property: ideas can be shared without  being used up; the most effective use of blueprints for life-saving medicine is  to provide drugs to sick people; finally, it is clearly unreasonable if 'a  person who owns something...can dispose of (or control access to) that  [thing]...without regard for others.'
				</p>
				<p>
					But  where, in all of these considerations do we find the claims of those who have  devoted their labour, time and resources to the research that goes into  developing medicines? Although ideas, once we have them, can be shared without  being used up, it can take a lot of money to come up with those ideas in the  first place. One estimate (probably on the high end) by the US government is  that it takes US$ 500 million to develop a new drug&mdash;this presumably factors  into the costs of development, the costs of testing drugs, especially on human  subjects, and of drug development attempts that fail.
				</p>
				<p>
					In what  follows, I will argue for the same conclusion as Swartz, that life-saving drugs  ought to be treated as public goods, specifically addressing what I expect to  be the main objections to that conclusion.

				<h4>The  argument from benefit</h4>
				<p>
					The usual argument for privatisation of some goods is that it benefits all  concerned. For example, it is argued that patents promote innovation by  guaranteeing that the incentivesinnovators have to do research (i.e.  profit) is protected, and by enabling innovators to share their knowledge so  that others can build on their discoveries or inventions upon payment.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  thinking about whether we should regard life-saving drugs as private or public  goods, we need to pay attention to the development of drugs and not just their  proper use. People who support privatising, or particular privatising schemes  such as patent protection, often argue that without such schemes, there would  be no incentives to do new drug research (or to share the results of such  research). However, many people do new drug research just because it is their  job, and national governments such as the US government or non-governmental  agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) fund new drug research  just because it is needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Will  people refuse to do research if they do not have the prospect of the riches  afforded by patent protection? This seems unlikely since scientists doing  research are happy to do so even when the only rewards are their salaries,  professional recognition and benefit to humanity. The patents usually go to  their corporate employers. Then, will people refuse to fund research if they do  not have the prospect of the riches afforded by patent protection? This may be  true, but research can be funded by taxes as well and research funded by taxes  might be directed towards desperately needed drugs for tuberculosis and malaria  rather than Viagra. Still, even if patents are not necessary incentives for  research, they might be, on the whole, beneficial to research&mdash;for example, by  protecting and enabling innovation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here it  is worth attending to the situational details that can make a scheme which  works in theory, but fails in practice. So consider who in the developing world  stands to benefit by signing the intellectual property codes set by the  developed world (which had no such codes when it was developing). Few  developing countries have drug industries at all, and they have to fight  expensive legal battles to keep first world drug companies from patenting  remedies that have been passed down through folk tradition. Further, as long as  drug companies are driven by the need for profit, they have little reason to  invest in research to find drugs for diseases prevalent in the developing  world, where the buying power is low. Thus, most people in the developing world  benefit less from privatised medical research than they would from medical  research driven by health needs and funded publicly. We should also ask: 'Who  in the developed world benefits from current intellectual property codes?' As  the standards for patenting become more precise, it becomes more and more  expensive to obtain patents. Some companies are choosing not to make their  research public, rather than to patent their findings. Driven by profit, drug  companies sometimes make cosmetic alterations in medications to extend their  patents. Life-saving medicines can be unaffordable to people in both the  developed and developing world&mdash;with the consumer paying not only for salaries  of chief executive officers and investor returns but also for expensive  advertising.

				<h4>The  moral argument</h4>
				<p>
					Many people believe that those who have discovered or invented the formulae for  manufacturing medicines have a right to those formulae, and not just to  compensation for their labour or a return on their investment. John Locke, the  classical liberal defender of private property articulated this intuitively  powerful idea in his Two Treatises of Government <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Locke J. In: Laslett P (ed). Two treatises of government. Cambridrge: Cambridge University Press, 1988." id="2">(2)</a> thus: 'Something becomes  mine, rather than the common possession of mankind, when I mix my labour with  it.' The reasoning seems to be something like, 'My body is my own, so my labour  is my own, so the products of my labour are my own.'
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  Locke held that the justification for my appropriating any part of the commons  is in the first instance that this is the condition of my benefiting from it.  For example, I need to make the fruit I find lying on the ground part of my  body to benefit from it; this need is what first justifies my private  appropriation of the fruit. Further, when I labour, my labour so increases the  value of whatever it is mixed with that I do not, by appropriation, decrease  what is available for others instead, I also increase the common stock.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two  consequences of this justification of private property in terms of benefit are  that: (i) in cases where appropriation does diminish what is available for  others&mdash;for instance, in the case of enclosures of the commons in England in  Locke's time&mdash;Locke opposed appropriation and (ii) if the goods I have  appropriated to myself spoil because I am not able to use them, then these  goods are no longer serving the purpose of property, which is for the benefit  of mankind, individually and collectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can  see that Locke did not treat private property as 'a moral and legal right to  exercise exclusive influence and control over a material object', come what  may. He traced the transgression of the natural limit on appropriation to the  invention of money: money makes it possible for one to appropriate more and  more to oneself without spoilage and to the detriment of the commons. Under  these circumstances, Locke argued, private property is no longer justified by  its benefit to mankind, but by a tacit agreement to the property system. If  this describes our circumstances, then we may ask: Did we agree to this system  of property allocation? What system should we agree to? One that allocates  property rights to the 'first' discoverer, or one that spreads the benefits of  discoveries and inventions, or some other system?
				</p>
				<p>
					We need  not take Locke's views as authoritative, despite his influence on our thinking  about property. I cite them because they are sensible, for they recognise that  property allocation arrangements must be justified, either in terms of their  benefits to all concerned, or on the basis of some agreement&mdash;which had better  be fairly made, if it is to justify anything. (In contrast, it looks as though  developing countries are being strong-armed into conforming to WTO's codes for  trade-related intellectual property rights by 2006.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally,  let us consider the position that ownership rights should reside with those  whose labour has created a given physical or intellectual product&mdash;whatever be  the overall social consequence. Note that this position does not support the  status quo, since currently corporate entities rather than researchers, usually  own patents. However, this position posits an unsupportable relationship  between labour and entitlement. Some people argue (following one line of  reasoning from Locke but not the others) that if you labour on something, you  have a right to that thing, because your labour is the source of its value.  However, this is simply false: natural resources are an obvious source of  value&mdash;the value of wood, for example, does not derive from logging alone, but  also from the trees that may have grown up on their own. Labour may add value  to things found in nature, but it does not create their value. (Marx's 'labour  theory of value' does not say that labour is the source of value, but that a  thing's exchange value is determined by the amount of labour it would take to  produce that thing&mdash;the thing in question can actually have fallen from the  sky.) I am not denying that people ought to be compensated for their labour, I  am denying that people have a right to what they mix their labour with.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reflection  on these considerations should, I believe, begin to dissolve the hold of the  intuition that discoverers and inventors, and 'makers' in general have some  right to what they make. They may have the power to share it or not, but that  power and right are not the same thing.
