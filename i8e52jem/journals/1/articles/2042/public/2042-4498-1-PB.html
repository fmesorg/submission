				<h4>Abortion pill or murder marketed?</h4>
				<p>
					I draw your attention to  the distribution and marketing of Mifepristone and Misoprostol by Sun, Cipla  and Zydus Alidac Pharmaceuticals. These drugs for abortion are supplied to  practising gynaecologists to be given to patients after obtaining their  consent. The money is to be collected from the patient by the physician, who in  turn turns it over to the drug representative. This is highly irregular,  unethical and illegal and cannot be equated with drug dispensing by primary  physicians at their dispensary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, the drug is  meant for the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). This must be done  according to the MTP Act, 1971, only by an <em>approved physician, in an approved  centre and for approved conditions</em> (threat to mother's life, congenital  anomalies, rape-induced pregnancy and pregnancy due to contraceptive failure,  the last only in the case of married women).
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the  promotional literature, the pill is to be distributed for abortion at home.  This is contrary to the provisions of the MTP Act. It makes no difference  that in the consent form circulated by drug companies and to be signed by the  patient, the patient agrees to take the pill in the physician's clinic. According  to the MTP Act, a gynaecologist's consulting chamber is not recognised for the  purpose of MTP. In any case, the abortion takes place at home and is not in  conformity with the MTP Act. The possibility of failure and profuse bleeding is  substantial. This would expose the patient to grave risks, especially in rural  settings. The risk is greater for unwed women for whom pregnancy is looked down  upon, and who may therefore not contact proper services and may abort and bleed  at home. Besides, the pill is being distributed through qualified and  unqualified medical practitioners in the country, though under the MTP Act only  a practitioner registered with the appropriate Medical Council can terminate a  pregnancy. This is virtually marketing murder for paltry monetary gains with  the open connivance of medical professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, the distribution  of full-text articles reproduced from the <em>New England Journal of Medicine,  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Journal of American  Medical Women's Association</em> as promotional material, with or without the  permission of the journals and the authors, is unethical. It amounts to lending  the name by authors for promotion of a brand/drug and amounts to 'association'  under the MCI Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					This marketing strategy  to promote the abortion pill as an 'in-house' abortion method is dangerous and  will claim hundreds of lives in the prevalent health care scenario in India.  Unsafe abortion under the garb of MTP is already claiming many lives in the  country.
