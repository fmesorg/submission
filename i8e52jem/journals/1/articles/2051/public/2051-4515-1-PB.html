				<h4>'Bust  oil' and other bogus claims</h4>
				<p>
					Irrational, useless and  even dangerous drugs flood the market. A certain company's rubs and iodide  products for local application do business worth crores of rupees every year in  India. Both multinational and Indian companies are involved in such practices.  Since we do not raise objections, the manufacturers keep pushing new products  to cheat consumers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, these tricks were restricted to what was sold as medicines.  Recently, cosmetic products have been launched with advertisements that make  false claims. Though vitamin E is not absorbed through the skin, soaps, creams,  oils and lotions advertise vitamin E as an ingredient. Hair is just a dead  extension of the hair follicle and its quality cannot be affected by external  applications; even then products in the market promise to improve hair growth  and retard greying.

					With the entry of international brands in the Indian market, useless health  drinks, herbal tea, nutritional supplements and breakfast cereals lure  customers with the false promise of improving health. Buyers are lured by the  nutritional and calorie content charts presented in stylish print and catchy  formats. These products contain iron, calcium, minerals, trace elements or  vitamins, but only in sub-therapeutic quantities. Such nutrients are present in  larger quantities in the normal Indian diet.

				<p>
					Recently, the FDA in Mumbai raided a 'herbal' tea distributor. An analysis  found the 'herbal tea' to be ordinary tea sold in fancy packaging for a high  price. Because there are takers, there are sellers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, certain newspapers and magazines carried colourful advertisements for  'bust oil'. Among the claims made about the oil is that 'it keeps the breast  toned up, it is needed by almost all age groups, it gives firmer, younger and  tighter breasts,' and so on. Efforts must be made to counter such false and  unethical advertisements.
