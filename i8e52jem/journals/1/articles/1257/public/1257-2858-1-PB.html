					In 1995, national dailies carried front-page reports on the
					need to control doctors' and lawyers' fees. The reports
					were a reflection of the salaried middle class' growing
					concern over the high cost of health care. However, the
					issue soon died a natural death &mdash; a demonstration of the
					political clout of those whose income was sought to be
					controlled.
				</p>
				<p>
					The news reports originated in the 13th report of the
					Committee on Subordinate Legislation, dealing with rules
					and regulations under the Medical Council Act, 1956. The
					report was presented to the upper house of parliament on
					December 9, 1994. Some of the report's observationsalso
					indicted the functioning of the medical profession and its
					legally constituted self-regulatory bodies, the Indian and
					State Medical Councils.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the report did not indicate a concern about
					doctors' high fees or the financial burden of health care
					borne by poor people. Having implicitly accepted that the
					market should drive health care services in our country, our
					honourable parliamentarians only endeavoured to make the
					doctor-patient transaction at the market place "transparent".
				</p>
				<p>
					The report noted that the code of medical ethics did not
					guarantee patients prior information of doctors' fees, and
					this was inadequate in protecting consumer sovereignity. It
					concluded that there should be some means "by which the
					patient could learn in advance the fee charged by all or most
					of the physicians of the type required by him, in which case
					he would be able to select the physician whose fee will suit
					him. It would also enable him to know what services are
					included in the fee charged and to compare the fee to be
					paid to a doctor with what others charge for similar services."
				</p>
				<p>
					Representatives of the medical councils protested that
					publicising doctors' services and prices would amount to
					advertising, which is prohibited by the code of medical ethics.
					The committee dismissed this protest by recommending
					suitable amendments in the code. It also asserted that "a
					directory containing all details of the physician and their
					charges should be published by the Medical Council of
					India." Also, "the Medical Council should make it
					compulsory for the doctors in private practice to notify their
					fees to the Medical Council which should include the
					standard charges for various services, operations etc."
					Clearly, the report was concerned only with the paying
					consumer. It had nothing specific to offer to consumers of
					free services in the governement health centres.
				</p>
				<p>
					The committee's recommendations reflected a trend in
					political thinking. Since then, there has been less talk about
					strengthening the primary health centre network to provide
					medical care. Medical care even in rural areas will be
					increasingly left to the private sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The committee's recommendations were meant to restore the credibility of the private health sector -- which
					had taken a beating in recent years -- by injecting
					transparency into the marketplace transaction, while
					simultaneously blunting the emerging demand for price
					controls in health care. A shift in the national policy has
					called for a withdrawal from commitment to public sector
					health services, along with some token regulation of the
					private health sector. The committee's report is a reflection
					of this policy change.
				</p>
				<p>
					The political scene is preoccupied with ensuring a
					competitive and corruption-free business environment. The
					suggestion of "transparency" is necessarily tagged with
					the idea of providing consumers information, a long-standing
					demand of consumer groups. After all, when one has no
					alternative but to buy health care, it is always good to be
					able to make a "rational choice". Second, once the principle
					of providing information to consumers is accepted, more
					demands for information on other aspects of health can be
					made.
				</p>
				<p>
					The demand for information on services and the way
					services are managed is valid irrespective of the way in
					which health care is organised &mdash; whether private,
					nationalised or a mixture of the two. However, there are limits
					to the information actually given by doctors and understood
					by patients in a market-based organisation of health
					services. The United States is a classic case study. Here,
					"information" and "choice" are considered essential elements
					of the medical care transaction. Consumer groups are strong,
					and courts and juries are sympathetic to litigants. Hospital
					prices and services are rated by consumer groups and
					consumers can obtain data on outcomes of various
					treatments provided by hospitals. Codes of medical ethics
					are also modified to allow some advertisement, to
					institutionalise peer review for assessing doctors'
					competency, and so on. Yet, can the US health system claim
					that consumers are making rational choices, that access to
					services is universal, that fees are reasonable and people's
					health status and the quality of care are commensurate to
					the country's health care expenditure?
				</p>
				<p>
					No. The US may top in the provision of unnecessary
					investigations, medications and surgeries. The health
					industry ensures the increasing medicalisation of people's
					lives to increase demand for their services. Though health
					expenditure in the US is the highest in the world, the health
					status of its people is not. There is no universal access to
					health care, and millions of US citizens do not full health
					insurance coverage. Finally, people have absolutely no
					control over the management of health services, an area
					tightly guarded by the corporations owning the system and
					professionals running it.
