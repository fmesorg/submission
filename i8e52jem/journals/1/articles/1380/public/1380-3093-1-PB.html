				<h4>Pinch of salt</h4>
				<p>
					I have been following,  for some years now, with great interest, and some amusement, the beliefs of  Kothari et al in their crusade against oncologists. Let me state right now,  that I enjoy reading their theories - but take them with the proverbial pinch  of salt. I refer specifically in this letter to their response to Mamdani's  letter on their article <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kothari ML, Mehta LA, Kothari VM. Evidence-biased therapy. Letter, Issues in Medical Ethics 1999; 7(3):70." id="1">(1)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					They state, in this  letter, that there is evidence "as recently as 1975" that removal of breast  cancer often worsens it. My point: 1975 is a quarter of a century ago. It would  not qualify as recent in most biomedical circles,although, on a cosmologic  scale, of course, things would be different. Important advances have taken  place in most fields, especially genetics and immunology, in the last 25 years.

				<p>
					"All cancer therapy is  glorified palliation." An impressive statement, backed by sufficient  references, at first glance. A close look, though, reveals that all six  references are to books written by the same team of authors &mdash; Kothari and  Mehta. If this is not biasing evidence, what is? I might add, that none of the  references are in peer-reviewed, indexed journals.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors make a  reference to a "small controlled trial" of one patient in each arm of the study.  Surely, you're joking, Drs Kothari, Mehta and Kothari? Statistics of this sort  are only made use of by toothpaste and cigarette advertisers, not by  responsible doctors.
