					Consumers  in the Third World get third-rate treatment from the pharmaceutical industry,  who sell them junk in the name of medicine. This includes formulations banned  in the parent country of international giants <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shiva M, Rane W. Banned and Bannable Drugs. New Delhi: Voluntary Health Association of India." id="1">(1)</a>. These companies have adopted  a new technique: marketing new formulations under old brand names without  informing consumers. These companies exploit people's faith in brand names and  the resistance to generic prescriptions. They also hide behind antiquated laws  which do not ban the launch of new formulations using old brand names.
				</p>
				<p>
					There  are several examples of this practice. This account describes the substitution  of contents in the brand Disprin manufactured by Reckitt Benckiser (India) Ltd.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disprin  is known for its aspirin content (acetyl salicylic acid with calcium carbonate  and citric acid). The company launched 'Disprin Plus' with much fanfare.  However, the new 'Plus' was actually minus the aspirin. By prefixing Disprin,  the company wanted to retain old consumers. The suffix 'plus' (without adding  anything), was to deceive them. Patients consumed paracetamol in place of  aspirin, knowing little about the effect of the switchover. Cardiac patients  taking aspirin for its platelet inhibitory effects were in for a shock when  these facts were made public. Prescribing doctors were ignorant of this  substitution till the press blew the whistle <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajendra D. Disprin plus minus aspirin foxes patients. The Hitavada, Nagpur, September 6, 2001." id="2">(2)</a>. The manufacturer had taken  everyone for a ride.
				</p>
				<p>
					This  unsavory story goes back to 2001 when aspirin was brought under the Drug Price  Control Order. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority notified ceiling  prices for aspirin and 20 other formulations. Soon, well-known brands of  aspirin disappeared from retail outlets. Evidently the industry was not willing  to market aspirin at the lower profit margin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then,  two companies, Reckitt Benckiser and Nicholas, decided to use their brand  advantage to introduce Disprin Plus and Aspro Plus, respectively, containing a  different drug, paracetamol <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chronicle Pharmabiz. Aspirin Shortage: industry at fault. [editorial]. Chronicle Pharmabiz. 2001;1:8" id="3">(3)</a>. Disprin was sold at Rs 2.25 for 10 tablets but  the new price ceiling was Rs 1.70. Disprin Plus was sold at Rs 9.40 for 10  (taxes extra).
				</p>
				<p>
					The  'new wine in old bottles' was launched with much publicity. There were many  pages of advertisement but the information that the brand contained  paracetamol, not aspirin, was in very small print.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a  rare case of solidarity, the Druggists and Chemists Association of Nagpur  boycotted the new product. Their apex body, the All India Organization of  Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), brought to the company's notice that the  addition of the word 'Plus' created the impression that the drug was basically  aspirin with an addition. This impression was reinforced by the similarities in  design of the two strip packs. The highlighted addition of the words 'new  formula' suggested that it was an improved formulation-not a different one  altogether. The AIOCD also drew the manufacturer's attention to sections in the  Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which relate to misbranded and spurious drugs,  warning them of the penalties <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajendra D. Statewide boycott of Disprin Plus. The Hitavada, Nagpur, September 12, 2001." id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  adverse publicity affected sales as consumers of Disprin switched over to other  brands. In response, Reckitt Benckiser inserted an advertisement 'for public  information', half-heartedly mentioning the difference between Disprin Plus and  low-dose aspirin <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Notice. The Times of India, Mumbai. September 14, 2001." id="5">(5)</a>. But the damage control exercise failed. Finally, in July  2003, the company withdrew Disprin Plus and made Disprin re-available in India  for a retail price of Rs 2.70 for 10 tablets (Rs 31.56 for 120 tablets, taxes  extra). Old wine was returned to the old bottle.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a  change, chemists and druggists, activists and the media showed what collective  power could do. If only such pharmaceutical activism can be seen more often,  the pharmaceutical industry will stop taking the patient population for  granted.
