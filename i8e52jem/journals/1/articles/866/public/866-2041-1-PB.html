					Do camera footage and  still photographs depicting death, disease and injury represent an invasion of  privacy, or are they appropriate forms of publicity? Recently, photographs of  patients suspected to be suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome  (SARS) were published in newspapers as well as shown on TV, causing  inconvenience and social stigma to all patients. While there was a need to  follow quarantine procedures, there was no necessity to widely publicise the  pictures. That act has caused mental and social harm to these individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					A profession must observe ethical standards; otherwise it will lack respect,  credibility and may also lay itself open to legal penalties. A medical  photographer is part of a team working for the benefit of a patient and,  thereby, the society. The end product of his activities is the photographic  record. The photographer must ensure that the end product of his photography is  treated with the same respect as is accorded to other records of the patient.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Permission  of the patient</h4>
				<p>
					Informed written  permission of the patient must be obtained before photography is undertaken. A  simple explanation such as 'The doctor wants a picture as part of your  confidential medical records to help him assess your treatment' is usually  acceptable. If it is a part of a project, this must be mentioned in the consent  form and approved by an ethics committee. In an educational institution, the  photograph may be used for teaching or for reference in the treatment of  similar cases. Care must be taken to respect the dignity and beliefs of the  patient. Every patient has a right to refuse to be photographed or to withdraw  consent. If a patient decides to withdraw consent, the records must not be  used. Photographs of the unconscious patient may be taken, provided a written  consent is obtained from the responsible person who has brought the patient and  later, from the patient himself.
				</p>
				<p>
					For photography of internal organs at operation or in the post-mortem room as  well as in endoscopic, pathological or microscopic documentation, permission of  the patient is not necessary, as the identity is not revealed. To maintain the  anonymity of these images, it may be wise not to record the patient's name with  the stored image. Images are catalogued with an image number and date. The  patient's name should not be shown in reproduction of X-rays, electrocardiogram  (ECG) or encephalogram (EEG) tracings, temperature charts, etc. Negatives,  master transparencies, original digital camera files and videotapes must be  logged and stored appropriately.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recording without  consent may be prescribed in certain circumstances such as suspected  non-accidental injury of a child where the recording of injuries is  demonstrably to the benefit of the patient.
				</p>

				<h4>Relationship with patients</h4>
				<p>
					An individual has a  fundamental right to privacy. Unauthorised publication may have social and  legal repercussions for the patient concerned. For instance, disclosure of  pregnancy, abortion, plastic surgery or the contraction of a sexually  transmitted disease, if made known without express permission may cause  embarrassment to the patient. It can result in legal proceedings against the  hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					The medical photographer  has a professional responsibility, both towards the patient and medical staff,  to regard all the photographs taken as being confidential. He has no legal or  moral right to display or publish photographs in a book or drug manual or film  without the written permission of the patient and the doctor in charge of the  treatment.
				</p>

				<h4>Digital photography of patients</h4>
				<p>
					The availability of  digital cameras has now made recording and storing of images easy. However,  there is tremendous scope for manipulation or tampering of digital images is  tremendous. To maintain the integrity of the image, manipulation may only be  carried out to the whole image, and must be limited to simple sharpening,  adjustment of contrast and brightness, and correction of colour balance. Images  of patients may be transferred to personal computers for use in connection with  ethics committee-approved and data-registered research projects or for the  preparation of teaching materials.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Relationship  with the medical profession</h4>
				<p>
					The ethics of clinical  practice are based on 'trust' in the doctor by the patient and other members of  the healthcare team. If disagreement occurs between the medical photographer  and members of the medical and nursing staff, the discord should never be  referred to in front of the patient; difficulties should be quietly and  reasonably resolved elsewhere. In teaching hospitals, the medical photographer  also has a vital role to play in the production of teaching aids for the  numerous professionals being trained within the hospital.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Hospital  etiquette and negligence</h4>
				<p>
					The codes of practice in  operating and post-mortem rooms must be learned before the medical photographer  enters either of the areas and he must strictly observe them. Rules include  requesting for permission to enter a ward, not disturbing a doctor while he is  with a patient and not interrupting a nurse while she is dressing a patient's  wound are based on the need for maximum care of the patient. It is advisable to  have a female nurse present if a male photographer is photographing a female  patient. The photographer has a moral responsibility to see that the records do  not represent the patient in an undignified fashion.
				</p>
				<p>
					There may be a  possibility of causing harm to a patient if the photographer is not careful.  This may occur if the lens hood falls into the operation field, or by causing  burns to the mucous membranes due to photographic lamps. However, this is rare.  Photographers should also be aware that a seizure might be precipitated by  repeated electronic flash discharges. He must change into proper operation  theatre attire to maintain asepsis. If necessary, cameras should be covered  with disposable plastic. One of my teachers used to set up a sterile trolley,  cover the camera with disposable sterile plastic and change his gloves to take  photographs. Though this was time-consuming, it prevented harm to patients.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Copyright and reproduction rights</h4>
				<p>
					Advertisements in medical  journals and the lay press regarding pharmaceutical products occasionally  project patients' images. A medical photographer owns the rights to any medical  photograph and can sell or give away the reproduction rights to a photograph.  He may agree to allow reproduction of a photograph, for a specified purpose,  without giving up the copyright. This action does not prevent the copyright  owner from similarly granting reproduction rights of the same picture to other  sources, unless the original recipient of reproduction rights has been given  sole reproduction rights. Though the laws may be varied, their purpose is to  see that 'fair play' is adhered to in relation to the end product of a  photographer's skill and industry. However, in such situations, reasonable medical  or monetary benefit must reach the patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Disposal of any unwanted photographs is another aspect of confidentiality. Any  well-run department of medical illustrations has strict rules concerning this  and will deploy a shredding machine for the disposal of unwanted films and  prints. With the increased use of digital formats, there is a need for good net  security in hospitals so that these pictures are not easily accessed if there  is no permission for display from the patient and doctor concerned.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus, the words <em>'primum non nocere'</em> (first of all, do no harm) apply even in  medical photography.
