				<p>
					Contrary to  international public health experience, identical versions of a Human  Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Bill are being considered in the respective state  assemblies of Maharashtra and Karnataka. These are private members' bills. The  National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has categorically stated that the  Bills do not have the support of either the central or the state governments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The apparent objective of the Bill is to promote the overall security of  society through the prevention and control of the spread of HIV infection  whilst providing optimal medical care for people living with HIV/AIDS.  However, the provisions of the Bill, if implemented, would result in breach of  HIV-positive people's rights to consent before testing, right to confidentiality  of sero-status and right to non-discrimination. In effect, the Bill would  serve to drive the epidemic underground and thus exacerbate the further spread  of HIV.
				</p>

				<h4>Discrimination</h4>
				<p>
					Section 3 of the Bill seeks to prevent discrimination against people living  with HIV/AIDS in relation to access to public places [and facilities]. The  Bill does not take into account that, in reality, [such] discrimination is not  practised against HIV-positive persons... In fact, people living with HIV/AIDS  encounter discrimination and are denied their rights in the areas of health  care, employment and insurance. The Bill is silent on these key areas of  discrimination.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Intentional transmission</h4>
				<p>
					Section 4 of the Bill sets out a provision that makes 'a person who in  all reasonable probability would have known her/his status' liable for  punishment. The provision does not indicate guidelines for deciding what  'reasonable probability' of an individual having knowledge of her/his HIV  status would be... Thus, even if a person merely has never tested for HIV and  does not know her/his HIV status, s/he may be penalised under this provision.  Section 4 also states that actual transmission is not necessary to make a  person liable. ...the mere marriage of an HIV-positive person to another person  who is not HIV-positive though with the free and full informed consent of the  other partner would be an offence. Furthermore, a sexual act between an HIV-positive person and a non-positive partner even if it is with full and free  informed consent and does not result in transmission of HIV would result in  making the HIV-positive partner liable. This section is also unclear as to  what kind of 'practice or behaviour' would be considered as having tendency to  place another person at risk... No safeguards are provided for the abuse of this  provision, which could easily result in the victimisation of people living with  HIV/AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India there exist sufficient provisions in the Indian Penal Code (IPC)  providing for punishments for the offence of intentional transmission of HIV...  Thus the penal provisions of the Bill are redundant and unnecessary.
				</p>

				<h4>Health care</h4>
				<p>
					[Under] Section 5 of the Bill... a medical professional, before  conducting any invasive medical procedure which would place her/him at risk,  can refuse to perform such a procedure unless the patient undergoes an HIV test  and the practitioner is informed of the result. This is clearly not based on  any sound scientific study or data... The data available on occupational exposure  of health care workers show that the risk of transmission from patients is so  minuscule that it can be ignored... At the time of the test the patient may be in  the window period resulting in a false negative test. By the Bill's logic, in  case of an HIV-negative report, the medical practitioner can be complacent  about taking precautions... This will only give the medical practitioner a false  sense of security. Doctors must realise that every patient is a possible HIV  case and they must take universal precautions in case of all patients coming to  them for treatment... There is also a possibility that the result is a false  positive; this is very high in the case of low sero-prevalence setting such as  India...
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the testing policies and guidelines of NACO and the World Health  Organisation (WHO), there cannot be any HIV testing without the consent of the  individual being tested. Already in most public and private hospital, doctors  conduct HIV tests as a matter of routine without consent though such practice  is illegal. This provision will only encourage such mandatory 'routine'  testing. International experience clearly indicates that public health  strategies which provide for coercive and mandatory testing have negative  public health repercussions. The tendency is for people living with HIV/AIDS  not to avail of treatment that requires mandatory testing thus negating the  very objective of providing treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Section 5, medical professionals could 'legitimately' deny  treatment to individuals, thus misusing this provision... This provision would  only let the private sector off the hook and the burden of treatment would have  to be disproportionately borne by the public health care sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ostensibly to safeguard patients from contracting HIV infection from  HIVpositive doctors, the Bill provides for the disclosure of the HIV-positive  status of medical practitioners to the HIV Prevention Board &ndash; an additional  administrative body to be instituted under Section 6 of the Bill. The creation  of an additional administrative body... is a flagrant waste of precious  resources... This provision apparently seeks to safeguard the interest of the  patient in not becoming HIV-positive during the medical procedure. It is  unsupported by any scientific data.
				</p>
				<p>
					...Health care workers have legitimate fears and apprehensions that must be  addressed. Their main apprehension is that of being exposed to HIV and the  consequent measures that are required to be taken, which are unfortunately  absent in the local scenario. It is well established that transmission of HIV  to health care workers can be virtually prevented by taking universal  precautions. However, in the unlikely event that health care workers do get  exposed to HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis is available locally and is not  prohibitively expensive...
				</p>
				<p>
					Section 8 of the Bill states that any person who is aware of her/his HIV  status is mandatorily required to give information of their status to the HIV  Prevention Board. This provision also states that any medical practitioner who  becomes aware of the HIV positive status of an individual is bound to give  information of the patient's HIV status to the Board. This would result in an  absolute breach of a citizen's fundamental right to keep their HIV status  confidential.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Central and state governments have... not made HIV status notifiable under  the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. However, this provision would  result in making HIV status notifiable. Experience the world over has shown  that making sexually transmitted diseases notifiable has had negative public  health implications. People living with HIV/AIDS whose confidentiality is  breached will not avail of service and the epidemic will be driven further  underground.
				</p>

				<h4>High-risk areas</h4>
				<p>
					Perhaps the most draconian section of the Bill, Section 10, is the one  that confers upon the state government the power to notify certain areas as  high risk areas... if the incidence of HIV in such areas would be so high as to  expose the public in that area to a high risk of infection.
				</p>
				<p>
					The provision totally ignores the fact that it is engaging in unsafe behaviours  which spreads HIV... Public notification of high-risk areas... would result in  stigmatisation of citizens living in the said areas. People not living in  notified high-risk areas would [have] a false sense of security and may resort  to high-risk behaviours. The notification of certain areas as high risk areas  would thus be counterproductive to preventing the further spread of HIV. Section  10 could easily result in further targeting and isolation of already  marginalised vulnerable groups like sex workers, eunuchs, injecting drug users,  men who have sex with men, etc. leading to the further spread of the epidemic.
				</p>

				<h4>Mandatory testing</h4>
				<p>
					Section 8 of the Bill provides that the HIV Prevention Board is given  power to require any person to furnish information, to submit him or herself  for an HIV test and to remove him or herself forthwith to a hospital for  special care and treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					As previously mentioned, international experience indicates that mandatory  testing and isolation will discourage people living with HIV/AIDS from coming  out in the open and availing of services and counselling facilities...
				</p>
				<p>
					Section 11 directly interferes with the personal liberty of the individual.  Under the Constitution and as common law, no person can be tested without his/ her informed consent... the exercise of the power to interfere with an  individual's liberty is left totally to the whims and fancies of the Board... The  Bill does not provide for any safeguards to prevent against arbitrary action by  the Board...
				</p>
				<p>
					The testing policies and guidelines set down by NACO as well as WHO expressly  prohibit mandatory testing. These policies have been developed relying on a considerable  amount of national and international experience...
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no assurance that the HIV Prevention Board would treat the information  received under the provisions of the Bill as confidential. This would have the  effect of driving the epidemic further underground by discouraging people who  are at risk or consider themselves to be at risk to access voluntary testing,  counselling and health services.
				</p>
				<p>
					... Furthermore, even after a person is removed to a hospital one fails to  understand what treatment would be provided. Considering that the epidemic is  progressing rapidly, relying on hospital-based or institution-based care  would be too expensive, impractical and often unaffordable...
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Collective response</h4>
				<p>
					...the proposed Bill... is counterproductive to any and all strategies for  preventing the further spread of HIV/AIDS. Thus it is of critical import that  we, as concerned individuals all of whom are affected by HIV/AIDS, mobilise a  collective response to ensure that this Bill does not become law.
