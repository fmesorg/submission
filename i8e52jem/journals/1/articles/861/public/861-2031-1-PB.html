					The severe acute  respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic has been one of the most dramatic  transnational infections of recent times. Images of entire populations of  countries carrying on their daily activities with facemasks have perhaps no  precedent in the history of man's struggle against infectious disease, except  in science fiction movies. Inevitably, there has been a scientific debate  surrounding the exact origin and nature of the virus, which will go on for some  time. At present, the epidemic seems to be on the wane.
				</p>
				<p>
					In their zeal to contain  the spread of the disease, many countries adopted strict quarantine policies  and put restrictions on travel. Apparently, those who had stricter quarantine  policies controlled the epidemic earlier. However, many contentious issues have  emerged from such policies.
				</p>

				<h4>Unbridled powers of quarantine</h4>
				<p>
					A fundamental question which touches the fields of public health policy,  medical ethics and human rights is whether the state has a right to forcibly  quarantine a suspected patient for the larger common good? Quarantine is an old  and established method of controlling infectious disease. The logic that the  state's public health responsibility gives it the right to isolate infected  individuals seems to be historically acceptable to society. Even in the setting  of SARS, quarantine was accepted as a viable way of controlling the infection.  Arguments about infringement of individual liberty were almost non-existent. In  fact, medical professionals argued that the loss of liberty was a price worth  paying <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Verghese A. The way we live now. Viral terrors. New York Times, April 20, 2003." id="1">(1)</a>. Whether such unbridled powers of 'quarantine' could be abused by a  state remains an open question.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if the rationale  behind quarantine is accepted, it is not clear how this can be enforced.  Further, the methods of enforcing the quarantine have demonstrated serious  violations of individual liberty and ethical principles. The grotesque  publicity in the media related to reported SARS patients (some of whom were  later tested negative) is one such example. Not only were the names of some  patients revealed but their addresses, occupations, family details were made  public as well. In the process, we saw a fundamental ethical principle being  violated&mdash;that of the patient's right to confidentiality and privacy. Patients  have now gone on record to say that since their names were revealed they are  being shunned by their neighbours and colleagues. In a particularly extreme  example of this phenomenon, members of a housing society in Poona accosted the  state's Director of Health Services demanding that a family reported to be  affected by SARS be shifted out of the housing society <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dasgupta D. Pune SARS free but shamed by the scare. Indian Express, April 27, 2003." id="2">(2)</a>. It is likely that  many of these individuals (including those who later tested negative) will  continue to face discrimination for some time to come.

				<h4>Need to respect patients' rights</h4>
				<p>
					Most rational individuals are likely to agree to be quarantined in the interest  of their families and fellow citizens. However, there could have been a more  humane method of enforcing quarantine while respecting the patient's dignity,  privacy and autonomy. For example, the patient could have been given a choice  of institution, or even quarantined at home. The patient's identity could have  been kept confidential, restricted to the treating doctors and hospital staff.  Patients and their families could have been counselled, on the basis of  available information from other countries, about the infectivity and natural  history of the infection, emphasising the fact that a large majority of  patients stage an uneventful recovery. Ideally, patients could be counselled  even before being tested for the disease. Finally, patients could have been  offered decent medical and psychosocial care during the quarantine process.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of SARS in  India, however, the exact opposite was done. The authorities' methods created  confusion, used coercion and spread panic. Suspected patients were banished to  infectious disease hospitals, like criminals to jail. Most of them were  ignorant of their medical problem&mdash;some did not even know whether they had tested  positive. Some of them heard about their test results from the media! In  Kolkata, a patient pleaded with the government to 'release' him from a hospital  as the hospital staff were discriminating against him in their treatment. In  Mumbai, one patient was reported to have 'escaped' from an infectious disease  hospital after being disgusted with the treatment he was receiving. The  Newspaper reported that'action' was being contemplated against the  superintendent for allowing this 'discharge' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Suspect escapes to Delhi, Mumbai to punish 'guilty'. Indian Express, April 27, 2003." id="3">(3)</a>. In Nashik, the entire  staff of a nursing home was in 'quarantine' as news reporters camped outside  trying to capture them on camera.
				</p>
				<p>
					It may be pertinent to  note that under normal circumstances the state shows very little interest in  its infectious disease institutions. For example, in Mumbai, the municipal  corporation-run Kasturba Infectious Disease Hospital has been a victim of  neglect for many years. It is ironical that the same system, which completely  ignores the health needs of the common man, was remarkably energetic and  efficient when dealing with SARS, as it literally hounded every case with even  the slightest suspicion of infection.

				<h4>Responses of doctors, civil liberties groups and media</h4>
				<p>
					While the SARS drama was being played out under the glare of the media. The  medical profession responded in a predictable fashion. Those in public  hospitals fell in line with the state's methods. The private sector put its  hands up and shifted patients to 'infectious disease' hospitals. Medical  professionals demanded 'adequate protection' before treating people suspected  to have SARS. Medical associations remained silent both on the scientific and  ethical issues. Even civil liberty and human rights groups ignored these events  and the issues they raised. The role of the media, which gave excessive and  premature coverage to all reports of anything even slightly resembling SARS,  and which threw confidentiality to the winds, was dubious to say the least.
				</p>
				<p>
					As this piece is being  written, the SARS story has slowly shifted from the newspapers'  front pages to the inside pages. The paparazzi have had their share of  interesting prime time news pictures. For those who were quarantined, the  nightmare has probably only begun. For the rest of us, another epidemic has  passed.
