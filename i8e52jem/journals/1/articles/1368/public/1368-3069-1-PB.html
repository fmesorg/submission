					Scientific research to  control women's fertility by causing immune reactions has been continuing for  almost three decades all over the world. This search for 'suitable targets  within the body' has been extremely controversial, with women's groups and health  activists globally opposing the 'vaccine-approach' to contraception that  treats pregnancy as a disease. In 1998, Saheli published a monograph titled,  "Target Practice: Anti-Fertility Vaccine Research and Women's Health", that  traced the development of the various Anti-Fertility Vaccines (AFVs),  highlighted the unethical and unsound scientific basis of this research, the  health hazards it poses for women and the social implications of their use. The  following article draws entirely upon this monograph, copies of which, along  with complete references, are available from Saheli.

					AFVs or immuno-contraceptives aim to induce an immune response in the body in  order to interrupt the process of reproduction. Theoretically, the intervention  can be made at most stages of reproduction. In the case of AFVs, researchers  must not only "choose" a target antigen that plays a critical role in  reproduction, they must also make the body component appear "foreign" to induce  the immune system to attack it.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>AFVs traditional vaccines</h4>
				<p>
					There are several  frameworks within which the difference between vaccines for infectious disease  control (traditional vaccines) and AFVs can be discussed, such as the  biological basis, immunological targets, recipient population, etc. Other  grounds, which have a bearing on risk-benefit analysis, include differing  perspectives of developers, providers and users and the right of the State to  impose programmes of control. Almost all of these differences are grounded in  the social, economic and gendered aspects of societies.
				</p>
				<p>
					While traditional vaccines aim to provide protection against debilitating or  life-threatening diseases, AFVs aim to prevent conception, a normal  physiological process which is not a disease. The action of traditional  vaccines is directed against foreign or 'non-self' antigens in the body, while  AFVs direct their action against 'self' antigens. Such vaccines that aim to  trigger an auto-immune response in the body necessarily interfere with its  self-tolerance. Consequently, they carry the potential for inducing auto- immune disease. Furthermore, traditional vaccines use the specific "memory" of  the immune system to continue to protect the body against re-infection and  confer long-term/lifelong protective immunity. In contrast, AFVs are expected  to offer contraceptive cover for a short, defined time period, and be  reversible to allow conception. But the 'switching off' action of immuno- contraceptives has not yet been established, and the long-term effects of  changing the immune status of the body still need scientific evaluation. In the  case of disease control, traditional vaccines may often be the only means of  prevention available. But while evaluating AFVs, it is important to remember  that numerous safe and effective alternate methods of contraception are already  available to women.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research on AFVs is  being carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the National  Institute of Immunology (NII), New Delhi, the Indian Institute of Science  (IISc), Bangalore, the Population Council, New York, USAID and other  institutions all over the world. While most AFVs are still at the animal trial  stage or Phase I human trials, the AntihCG vaccine developed by NII has reached  Phase II trials. But many trials have flouted ethical norms of biomedical  research, and shown little regard for women's health. In exposing some major  violations, we have considered the Helsinki Declaration, the CIOMS Guidelines  and ICMR Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Subjects.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Basis for human trials</h4>
				<p>
					Research on human subjects should be based on adequate laboratory and  animal experimentation, and knowledge sufficient to predict potential hazards.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violations: Much remains to be learnt about the immune system itself. Since  AFVs induce immune reactions to cause contraception, this has many  implications.</em> One of the most important concerns is of cross reactions that  have been widely reported in published studies. And uncertainty remains about  whether these are beneficial or problematic. Other potential hazards include  hypersensitivities, auto-immune diseases and permanent infertility. No  conclusive evidence is available to either rule these out, or predict them  accurately, so the human trials that have been conducted have been based on  insufficient information, and are therefore premature and unethical. In India in  1974, Anti-hCG Vaccine trials were also conducted on 6 women prior to  completion of animal studies.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Risk-benefit assessment</h4>
				<p>
					Predictable risks must be carefully compared with foreseeable benefits  before human trials are initiated, and the interests of the subject must  prevail over the interests of science and society.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violations: Despite  almost three decades of research on AFVs, failure rates are unacceptably high,  immunological safety has not been established, long-term toxicity and  teratological effects not ruled out and the effect on the foetus not  conclusive. </em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Other concerns include the hazards of repeated immunisation and the  unpredictability of immune response among trial subjects. The interaction  between AFVs and HIV infection has also not been adequately studied. Yet, human  trials of AFVs have continued. Since AFVs expose healthy people of reproductive  age, mostly women in the prime of their lives to an range of health hazards,  the risks these women may have to face are totally unacceptable. The cost  effectiveness of "treating" large numbers with "immunisation against pregnancy"  cannot gain precedence over concerns for women's health.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					In the absence of conclusive data from laboratory and animal tests to  rule out possible short-and long-term side effects, it is unethical for  researchers to make claims of safety and reversibility of the method under  trial. It is only when participants are fully aware of the possible risks and  of the areas where full knowledge of hazards is not yet known (e. g. effect on  offspring), that their participation can be called genuinely 'informed'.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violations: In the Anti-hCG Vaccine trials in India, the entire procedure of  informed consent was unethical. Information about possible side-effects or  hazards was absent in the Informed Consent Form and Information Brochure  prepared by NII.</em> Conducting trials from Family Planning Centres in government  hospitals, where approved contraceptives are offered, further exposes a  strategy to capitalise on women's ignorance and vulnerability.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Trials on lactating women</h4>
				<p>
					Pregnant or nursing women should not be subjects of any trials except  those designed to protect or advance the health of pregnant or nursing women,  foetuses or nursing infants.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violation: In another instance of blatant violation, Dr. G. P. Talwar conducted  clinical trials of the AntihCG vaccine on 20 postpartum women through 2 Indian  centres.</em> Despite having published papers quoting the study, Talwar publicly  denied having done so when challenged by women activists at the VII  International Congress of Reproductive Immunology in Delhi, October 1998.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Right to compensation</h4>
				<p>
					Research subjects who suffer physical injury as a result of  participation must receive financial and other assistance to compensate  temporary or permanent impairment or disability.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violation: Besides a WHO-HRP trial where the Swedish government covered  potential damages from clinical trials, there are few instances of  compensation/health insurance cover for AFV trial subjects. Participants in  India have had no such cover or assurance of treatment/medical attention. </em>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Follow-up</h4>
				<p>
					In contraceptive trials, especially with methods like AFVs that impact  both the immune system and the reproductive system, it is essential that women  be followed up for a length of time to assess side-effects or problems. In the  light of prior experiences like the diethyl-stilbestrol (DES) tragedy, where  some adverse effects became apparent only after the children born to trial  subjects attained puberty or reached the reproductive age, it is safer to err  on the side of caution. Yet, it is shocking that no established guideline on  human trials has laid down norms for such follow-up. Even the WHO has only  made a "recommendation" to follow up progeny until puberty. Not surprisingly,  both research and funding institutions, relieved of the 'burden' of having to  conduct long term follow up, are content to make unsubstantiated claims.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Violation: According to published reports of Talwar's Anti-hCG Vaccine trial,  only 94 out of 162 women interviewed 'volunteered' for long term follow-up. </em>
				</p>
				<p>
					When the NII was questioned by women's groups about why follow-up was not  built into the study design, they had no explanation to offer. WHO conducted  long-term follow-up of the subjects of its Anti-hCG Vaccine trials in  Australia, only when urged to do so by its Gender Advisory Panel in February  1996. Not surprisingly, a decade after the trials, only 1 out of 45 subjects  could be traced.
				</p>
				<p>
					The same apathy is apparent in the follow-up of children born during or after  the trials. In more than 20 years since the first human trials of the AntihCG  vaccine, offspring born to women who became pregnant during the trials either  accidentally or intentionally, have not been systematically followed up and no  data exist to rule out adverse effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Funding agencies involved in the trials of AFVs have also been equally  irresponsible. Canada-based International Development and Research Centre  (IDRC) which funded the Phase II trials of the Anti-hCG vaccine in India,  professed a commitment to long-term follow-up of the women till 2003. But in  1998, it retracted its stand and concluded that "women and their children have  received conscientious follow-up care which has produced no evidence of  complications due to their participation in the vaccine study". Such premature  conclusions are extremely unscientific and totally unacceptable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The unethical research of AFVs is only a case in point. Many long-acting,  invasive, provider-controlled contraceptives have been developed, researched  and marketed with the same disregard for ethical norms and the participants in  the trials. In a country like India, with a state-run health programme and an  overriding population control ideology, this has serious implications for the  health and well-being of millions of women and men.
