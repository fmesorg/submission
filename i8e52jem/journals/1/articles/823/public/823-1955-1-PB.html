					Having  worked on the institutional review boards (IRBs&mdash;also known as ethics  committees) of some institutes, I have a few comments to make on their role in  research planning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every  research institute should formulate a policy statement, which should be made  available to the IRB. It should mention the type of research it will undertake,  e.g. pre-clinical toxicology, animal studies in pharmacology or pathology,  epidemiological surveys, clinical trials involving patients and studies using  healthy volunteers, depending on its resources and infrastructure. This will  help in deciding the types of studies to be avoided. The purpose of  research&mdash;the benefits to be expected from the point of view of its staff,  clients, students, society in general or the local community and the institute  itself&mdash;should be revealed in this policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every  research protocol should be scrutinised and cleared by a scientific advisory  committee before it is presented to the IRB. Proposals from abroad should have  been scrutinised and cleared by an academic body in that country. The local  committee may suggest modifications to suit local conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The IRB  is not expected to examine the technical details and statistical design in  depth. It considers mainly the interests of research subjects. Participating  research workers, clinical and para-clinical staff, administrative staff and  the institute as a whole may also be objects of its review to some extent.  Taking into consideration the source of funding, study objectives, and the  welfare and rights of volunteers, patients or (in animal research) animals, the  IRB can suggest suitable modifications to the plan or reject it totally.
				</p>
				<p>
					The IRB  should approve the information and consent forms to be presented to the  patients or volunteers recruited for the study. These documents should be in  simple language and contain no inducements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Approval  of the IRB should be for a specific period of time, during which the researcher  is expected to report to the IRB the occurrence of any unexpected adverse  events, difficulties encountered in the work and the progress of the work in  general. The IRB has the right to stop the study, modify the protocol or deny  further extension of the initial approval if it thinks that the study is not  proceeding satisfactorily. For an imported project, guidelines provided by  agencies responsible for the protection of rights in the parent country will be  useful in continuing the review.
				</p>
				<p>
					Data  obtained during the course of the study, the results of data analysis and  conclusions drawn from these results are important concerns from the points of  access, custody, ownership, secrecy and publicity. These must be clarified in  the research proposal. The IRB must insist that the funding agency or the  sponsor will have no access to raw data and individual records. They will be  submitted a report in a format similar to that of a paper sent for publication.  Interim reports of progress of work may be given for release of instalments of  grant. The final analysis should always be made by an academic institute.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  identities of the patients or volunteers must be guarded in most studies. If  leftover biological material will be preserved and used in another study,  informed consent forms must mention this possibility. The protocol should also  clarify whether the individuals will receive the results of investigations  performed on them, either immediately or after a period.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  institute and the IRB should insist that the study results are quoted only in  scientific literature or technical reports submitted to regulatory authorities  and not used for media publicity aimed at the lay public.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  working of the IRB involves extensive documentation. A properly designed  research project is educative from the point of view of record keeping, which  proves useful to the researcher in the long run.
				</p>
				<p>
					To  conclude, one must understand that the IRB is an important tool, which can be  used to put into practice the concern expressed by the medical profession about  medical research nearly 40 years ago in 1964 in Helsinki, and which continues  to be expressed to cover a wider field.
