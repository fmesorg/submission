					There has been an  explosion of qualitative research in public health over the 1980s and '90s. It  has delved into a wide range of issues, from the most public to the most  private, often relating to some of the most socially and culturally sensitive  of subjects. It has wide and deep ramifications for approaches to health  service development and for changing social perspectives. Yet there has been  little discussion of its ethical dimensions. Many of the issues dealt with are  socially contentious and therefore there is a need to develop mechanisms for  resolving them in accordance with ethical principles [non-maleficence,  beneficence, autonomy, confidentiality and justice as enunciated, for example,  in the draft code of conduct for ethics in social sciences and health research <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="CEHAT: Ethics in Social Sciences and Health Research - A Draft Code of Conduct. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; VIII (2): 53-57" id="1">(1)</a>]. Avoiding addressing them at this stage may harm the cause of qualitative  research in public health as well as the cause of public health itself. This  note attempts to raise some of the general issues that have emerged from  specific instances of conflict related to qualitative public health research.  It should be read as a form of loud-thinking and an invitation to  brainstorming.
				</p>
				<p>
					While some basic rules of ethical conduct of medical research can be extended  to social science research in public health, some specificities of the latter  raise additional ethical issues. Biological safety is the first prerequisite of  medical research. For example, the clinical trial of a drug must ensure that  there is only a low acceptable level of risk of side-effects to the persons to  whom it is administered. Shouldn't the same principle of non-maleficence be  applied to the likely negative social impact?
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, the well accepted ethical guidelines for medical research are based  on a notion of rights of the individual, for instance 'ensuring  confidentiality' of persons undergoing a screening test such as that for HIV  infection, or 'taking informed consent' for any experimental medical procedure  from the individual undergoing it. This is logical because the individual  patient is the unit for intervention in clinical medicine. But for public  health where the 'total population' and its subgroups are the units for action  and analysis, should the ethical principles not be applied at that level?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>New rules of ethical conduct?</h4>
				<p>
					If we accept both these propositions it would mean that rules for  ethical conduct of qualitative research should include the following:
				</p>
				<p>
					Data with socially  negative connotations should be presented in a way that they do not stigmatise  a specific community or group,
				</p>
				<p>
					Mechanisms should be  evolved for obtaining informed consent from the group (and not only from  individuals within it) after providing it with information about the objectives  of the research and its possible negative consequences, and
				</p>
				<p>
					The likely negative  impact of the research, and its findings, on social processes affecting the  study population and its sub-groups should be considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The obvious question to be addressed for all these is, how do we assess the  impact of the research on social processes?
				</p>
				<p>
					An understanding of the context in which research is being undertaken is  crucial to assess its probable impact. There are primarily two kinds of social  science studies in health. There are those that are purely addressed to social  science agendas and attempt to analyse social processes through health issues.  The second kind, relating to public health programmes and policies <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Foundation For Research in Community Health: Health Research Studies in India - A Review and Annotated Biblography. FRCH, Mumbai, 1994." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Viswa Deepak: Sexual Behaviour Patterns in the Context of HIV/AIDS in India - A Review, Unpub. M.Phil dissertation, CSMCH, JNU, New Delhi, 1998." id="3">3)</a>, are  the ones addressed in this article. The objectives for such research are  commonly linked to public health programmes in order to know how the particular  population or community will respond to the pre-decided programme strategy, and  how best to operationalise it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore, this qualitative health research has primarily focused on (i)  people's health-related behaviours (child care and dietary practices,  sanitation and hygiene, sexual behaviours, treatment seeking for illness,  etc.), (ii) health-related perceptions (about the body and its functioning,  illness and disease, preventive and curative measures, and the available  treatment-providers and health care services), and (iii) health services  research (structure and processes of institutional functioning, interaction  between different categories of personnel, interaction of care-providers with  lay people, etc). Thus, public health programmes and policy agendas greatly  influence the qualitative research, which can sometimes feed back and influence  them in turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					Qualitative research findings can be used for action within formal organised  structures (as advocacy tools for policy and programme formulation, and for  improving management of programmes and services). The health sector reforms of  the 1990s illustrate this use of qualitative health research. They can also be  used for socio-cultural intervention involving action in the 'community' for  bringing about changes in knowledge, attitude and behaviour, through health  education, community mobilisation for health issues or/and empowerment of  socially weaker sections. This often implies questioning and changing existing  social perspectives and values within the community and the health system. The  action against gender disparities in recent years is an excellent illustration  of this. The subject 'sexuality' is another such example but with less clarity  and greater contention about the desirable directions of change. The worth and  role of folk knowledge is also, similarly, a contended subject involving value  positions on relationships between human beings and between them and nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					The influence of qualitative research on social values and health perspectives  raises a set of ethical dilemmas because of the divergent views and interests  that they represent at several levels. On the one hand is the notion of health  of lay people in all societies, which has been found to relate health status to  basic need fulfillment, quality of life, social environment, and emotional  well-being <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Herzlich C. : Health and Illness - A Social Psychological Analysis, Academic Press, London, 1973." id="4">(4</a>, <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Castro R.: The Subjective Experience of Health and Illness in Ocuiatuco - A Case Study, Soc. Sc. &amp; Med. 41(7) pp 1005-21, 1995" id="5">5</a>, <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Priya R.: Dalit Perceptions of Health, Seminar, 428, 15-19,1995." id="6">6)</a>. On the other is the formal public health structure  primarily shaped in the present by the bio-medical paradigm of health and the  technocratic approach to public health problems. The latter position promotes  the application of 'universal' strategies through centrally controlled,  technology-based programmes which play down the significance of the social  context of ill-health and health interventions <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pertersen A. &amp; Lupton D: The New Public Health-Health and Self in the Age of Risk. Sage Pub., London, 1996." id="7">(7)</a>. This involves a  non-responsiveness to local context and priorities, and an inordinate power of  the 'expert' and the international bureaucrat over 'lay people'. The failure of  public health in the past has highlighted the negative consequences of such an  approach <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Banerji D.: Health and Family Planning Services in India - An Epidemiological, Socio-cultural and Political Analysis and a Perspective, Lok Paksh, New Delhi, 1985." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, the context of research includes local social disparities on one hand  and global politics and neo-imperialism on the other. Within the study  population or group that is often defined by geographic and administrative  boundaries, there is diversity, for example, of caste, class and gender.  Dominant sections within the community (upper caste and class, male) will  favour perspectives that help maintain their superior status, and oppose social  interventions that threaten their position. The 'universal' international  strategies, with their liberal democratic perspective giving equal rights to  each individual irrespective of gender, caste, class or race, are then more  attractive than the communitarian approach <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kiss Elizabeth: Democracy and the Politics of Recognition, in Shapiro I. &amp; Hacker-Cordon C (Ed.) Democracy's Edges, Cambridge Univ. Press, UK, 1999." id="9">(9)</a>. And the current dominant  international development discourse promotes the liberal perspective, thereby  gaining support of one section of progressive forces at the local level.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand is the context of international politics and the hegemony of  the 'northern' perspectives on the policies of the 'southern', which creates  the dilemma in accepting the international discourse as the desirable social  perspective and value framework to which all communities and peoples must be  channelised. In the current situation, significant determinants are the  economic structural adjustment policies (SAP) which bring with them  ramifications in other spheres. According to one view, SAP create an  environment that allows the dominating biomedical and technocratic paradigm of  public health to make even greater inroads into southern countries <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rao M (Ed): Disinvesting in Health-the World Bank's Perceptions for Health, Sage Pub., 1999." id="10">(10)</a>. Others  add to this analysis the understanding that SAP and technocratic programmes  bring with them an aggressive cultural promotion of consumerism and  individualism that are essential for establishing market mechanisms and  breaking down local collectivities and social support structures. This results  in economic, social and cultural degeneration of societies of 'the south' which  breaks their self-confidence and weakens their ability to regenerate  themselves, thereby further legitimising the dominance of 'the north'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The negative social consequences of these processes are suffered most by the  previously marginalised at both the international and local community levels.  The international intervention and the neo-liberal perspective from which it  draws its legitimacy is thereby a negative influence even for the marginalised.  This is reflected in the sphere of public health as well <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Qadeer I.: Health Care Systems in Transition III - The Indian Experience, Journal of Public Health Medicine, Great Britain, 1999." id="11">(11</a>, <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Priya R.: Issues of Women and AIDS in India, Political Environments, 4, 33-38, 1996." id="12">12)</a>. Ironically,  it is not within the individual rights framework that a fight is put up against  this international hegemony. Collectivities with a nationalist or community  identity usually catalyse such struggles.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we accept that this analysis of the current international impact is even  partially valid, then we face a dilemma because there is no one perspective or  value framework that we can consider 'the best' and use as a reference point  for evaluating the impact of qualitative research on processes of social  change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Is it then ethically justifiable to impose research and analysis from a certain  perspective on a study group or community with a predominantly divergent  perspective? Certainly this question cannot mean that researchers should not  question community value positions. How do we resolve this?
				</p>
				<p>
					We can turn to anthropology that has long dealt with the issue of diverse value  frameworks for some methodological ways of dealing with this ethical problem.  One is the whole debate of the emic (the 'insider' view) vs. the etic (the  'outsider' view). The emergent understanding <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bose Pradip Kumar: Research Methodology - A Trend Report, Research in Sociology and Social Anthropology - Monograph 4. ICSSR, New Delhi 1995." id="13">(13)</a> was:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						That the researcher cannot become an 'insider' but can attempt to understand  the study group's world view.
					</li>
					<li>
						To do this the researcher must contextualise in great detail the collective  process and the specific case studies and then interpret them in relation to  the group's world view, and
					</li>
					<li>
						The researcher must not stand in judgement about the study group but only  attempt to explain their behaviour and perceptions by understanding their  logic.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					A conceptual study design which allows contextualising of findings on a  specific subject is important here. For instance, studies showing greater  recourse to the private sector and services for payment even by the poor could  be interpreted to justify user fees and promotion of the private sector because  the treatment seeking was not placed in the context of the condition of the  public sector or the degree of indebtedness of these groups due to spending for  treatment. Similarly, analysing the sexual behaviour of those with multiple  partners within the context of the norm of the whole group provides a very  different perspective to the problem of AIDS from the high risk group approach  espoused by the AIDS control programme. Analysing the factors leading to the  norms can also provide directions for a more effective AIDS control strategy <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Priya R.: Contributions of the Behavioural Sciences in the AIDS Control Programme - An Epidemiological Perspective, Paper presented at the Conference on Role of Behavioural Sciences in Community Health, JALMA, Agra, 2nd-3rd Oct. 1999." id="14">(14)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this alone has not been found to be adequate in safeguarding the study  group's interests. Given the ramifications (of conflicting social values and  perspectives as well as conflicting material and power interests) related to  the qualitative research in public health, three ethical issues arise &mdash;
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						How does the research represent the needs and views of the marginalised  within the study group as against the dominant groups?
					</li>
					<li>
						How does the research represent the needs and views of lay people (which may  include the community's dominant view but not the minority view within the  community) as against the technocratic view?
					</li>
					<li>
						How does the researcher mediate between the possible positive and negative  consequences of the liberal technocratic perspective and of the study groups'  perspective?
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The basic issue would be the right of the community &mdash; and within it of the  marginalised &mdash; to decide if they want to participate in such research, to be  given information up front, and to be fed back the findings. This also requires  ensuring an environment in which the study group feels free to call upon and  articulate its own value positions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the methodological solutions provided by the anthropological  debate given above, some possible checks could be:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						A self-critical assessment to see if the researcher's agenda and reference  point is the local context or the international dominant discourse.
					</li>
					<li>
						A mechanism for dialogue between the researchers and the community about  objectives of the research, its findings and their interpretation of it.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					This dialogue is the ingredient for finding the common ground of researcher  perceptions and study group perceptions. It also allows the researcher and the  study group to maintain their own value positions even while they examine them  critically and may be even modify them. However, for this to occur there must  be a respect for the others' value frame so that the exchange can occur on an  equal footing. This may require a self-reflective exercise by the researcher.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best way to really put all the above ethical requirements into practice may  be by the researcher being in constant interaction with the study group over a  long time in diverse situations. Acquire friends with whom to share laughter  and tears, with whom to fight, and from whom to learn. Respect the collective  wisdom of the community and yet debate with it. Such ethical research in public  health would certainly be a demanding exercise but also a rewarding one.
