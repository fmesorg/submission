					Waikar <em>et al.</em> express  forceful opinions about ECT. I am duty bound to inform readers that their  article contains at least 25 serious factual errors, and 17 serious errors of  perspective and context. Space constraints do not allow me to provide a  point-wise, scientifically-referenced refutation of their article; however, if readers  with specific concerns write to me, I will provide clarifications supported by  research published in journals of repute.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am aware that  nongovernmental organisations require a drum to beat to make their presence  felt; however, I would prefer to ascribe more ethical motives to these authors,  and believe that they think as they do because they have no (stated) medical or  psychiatric background nor direct experience with ECT. My response will  therefore be measured and good-tempered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The views of Waikar et  al. can be resolved under two headings: that ECT is barbaric, and that  unmodified ECT is especially unethical. I will consider each of these views.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Is ECT barbaric and should it be discontinued?</h4>
				<p>
					From an emotional  perspective, a seizure-inducing treatment could certainly seem barbaric.  However, if ECT is barbaric or unattractive, so too are cardioversions,  abortions, Caesarean sections, radical mastectomies, open heart surgeries,  orthopaedic and neurosurgical procedures, and countless other medical and  surgical interventions; so, where does one draw the line? The answer is simple:  if the risk-benefit ratio favours the treatment, and if the treatment is better  than existing alternatives, in the interest of the patient the treatment must  survive. This cold logic has guided medical practice for decades, and is the  reason why ECT remains a valuable treatment more than six decades after its  introduction.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are certainly  countries, such as Japan and Italy, in which the practice of ECT is dying out  for idiosyncratic reasons (and not because of legislation). However, in  countries in which a high quality of care is assured to patients, ECT continues  to be practised. In the USA, where the standards of medical care are higher  than anywhere else in the world, the use of ECT is, in fact, increasing <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rosenbach ML, Hermann RC, Dorwart TA. Use of electro-convulsive therapy in the Medicare population between 1987 and 1992. Psychiatr Serv 1997;48:1537-1542." id="1">(1)</a>.  During the past decade millions of dollars have been allotted in over a dozen  research grants from the US Government through the National Institute of Mental  Health (NIMH) to study different forms of ECT <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sackeim HA, Prudic J, Devanand DP, Nobler MS, Lisan-by SH, Peyser S, et al.

A multicentre consortium,  funded by more multi-million dollar. NIH grants, NIH grants, is currently  examining wider indications for ECT such as the extension of ECT into the  maintenance phase of treatment <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petrides G, Fink M, Husain MM, et al.

				</p>
				<p>
					We therefore, do Waikar <em>et al.</em> express the views that they do? Perhaps it is because they have come  across instances of the sub-optimal practice of ECT. If so I have two  responses:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						If a treatment  is abused, the practitioners are to blame, and not the treatment. Readers will  know that treatments ranging from antibiotics to Caesarean sections are  over-enthusiastically used by unscientific or unscrupulous practitioners; yet,  this is not an argument for withdrawing antibiotics or abolishing Caesarean  section. By targeting the treatment because of its misuse, Waikar et al.  compromise their own judgement and credibility.
					</li>
					<li>
						treatment is  best evaluated at centres at which it is well practised. I encourage Waikar et  al. to visit centres, such as the one at which I am employed, where ECT is  administered only after obtaining informed consent and in accordance with  international guidelines. Waikar et al. will discover that patients who receive  ECT are grateful for the intervention. None of my colleagues, nor I, have  encountered patients who considered that we used ECT as a form of punishment or  torture. If Waikar et al. form opinions from a few patients who have felt  ill-used by ECT, they have a moral duty to moderate these opinions with the  views of the large segment of patients who appreciate the treatment.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					In this context I ask  Waikar et al. how many patients they have personally interviewed who have  resented receiving ECT and whether these patients identified through systematic  sampling or did they form a disgruntled, unrepresentative subgroup?  Scientifically, only patients identified through a recognised method of  sampling can be considered representative of the population this is because  dissatisfied patients can be found for all treatments.
				</p>
				<p>
					True, ECT is associated  with adverse effects; the commonest problems are transient memory disturbances,  headache, and bodyache. Less commonly, more severe or longer-lasting memory  disturbances may occur. Taken out of context, these adverse effects argue against  the use of the treatment. However, taken out of context, the brutality of open  heart surgery and the cognitive impairment that the procedure produces <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Newman MF, Kirchner JL, Phillips-Bute B, Gaver V, Grocott H, Jones RH, Mark DB, Reves JG, Blumenthal JA, for the Neurological Outcome Research Group and the Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Research Endeavors In-vestigators. Longitudinal assessment of neurocognitive function after coronary-artery bypass surgery. N Engl J Med 2001;344:395-402." id="4">(4)</a> should, similarly, argue against the practice of such surgery. As stated  earlier treatment decisions are based on risk-benefit ratios, and on  comparisons with existing alternatives. Thus, when the common and uncommon  adverse effects of ECT are compared with the common and uncommon adverse  effects of drugs, and when the superior benefits with ECT are measured against  the unimpressive effects of drugs in selected sub-populations of patients, it  appears that, for these sub-populations of patients, adverse effects  notwithstanding, ECT can be the treatment of choice.

				<h4>Is unmodified ECT unethical?</h4>
				<p>
					Early during my research  career, I found that only 44.2% of Indian psychiatrists who administered ECT  always administered modified treatments, and that as many as 24.2% invariably  administered unmodified ECT; I was appalled <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Agarwal AK, Reddy MV. The practice of ECT in India. 2. The practical administration of ECT. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:81-86." id="5">(5)</a>. When Tharyan <em>et al.</em><a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tharyan P, Saju PJ, Datta S, John JK, Kuruvilla K. Physical morbidity with unmodified ECT: a decade of experi-ence. Indian J Psychiatry 1993;35:211-214." id="6">(6)</a> published data which suggested that risks with unmodified ECT were fewer than  earlier believed, I reacted with the same horror that Waikar et al. presently  show <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: A note of caution. Indian J Psychiatry 1995;37:99-100." id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I received mixed  support. Practitioners in large institutions, such as my own, supported my  views. Practitioners in small psychiatric facilities, however, chose to  disagree. They believed that I had no right to preach from an ivory tower,  ignoring the ground realities of the environments in which they worked. Their  arguments were reasoned. If a patient who is stuporous or suicidal requires ECT  as an emergency intervention, would it be more ethical to allow him to die  because an anaesthesiologist is not immediately available to supervise ECT? If  a patient is psychotically depressed in a town in which the anaesthesiologists  are burdened with surgical caseloads, would it be more ethical to allow the  patient to suffer for weeks to months, receiving drugs which are less  effective, because the anaesthesiologists did not have time for minor  procedures such as ECT? If a poor patient suffers from an illness for which ECT  is the treatment of first choice, would it be more ethical to allow him to  suffer for months or longer with less effective drugs because he cannot afford  the extra hundreds of rupees per ECT that the use of anaesthesia necessitates?
				</p>
				<p>
					In the face of these  arguments, I realised that the only way to convince my colleagues against  unmodified ECT was to obtain and publish hard data on the morbidity associated  with it. My colleagues and I chose to focus on spinal fractures with the  treatment, the most common complication recorded in western literature. The  study was conducted in a hospital in which unmodified ECT was routinely  administered because of unavailability of anaesthesiological support.  Anterioposterior and lateral X-rays of the thoracolumbar spine were routinely  obtained before and after a course of unmodified ECT, and after every complaint  of backache in 50 consecutive patients who received the treatment, to utter  astonishment only 1 patient (2%) experienced an adverse spinal event; this was  considered relatively minor by the consultant orthopaedist, and was treatment  with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C, Rele K, Sutharshan R, Shah N. Musculoskeletal morbidity with unmodified ECT may be less than earlier believed. Indian J Psychiatry 2000;42:156-162." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I no longer shrilly  condemn unmodified ECT. However, to reassure Waikar et al. I do not  condone the procedure either. When we published our unmodified ECT study, we  concluded with several paragraphs on the limitations of unmodified ECT; we  added a strong caveat that our findings were not an endorsement of its routine  practice. Waikar et al. completely misread my views in my commentary <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Andrade C. Unmodified ECT: ethical issues. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;XI:9-10" id="9">(9)</a>; to  quote.
				</p>
				<p>
					'It therefore appears  prudent to conclude that while modified ECT may be the ideal, there can be  situations in which unmodified ECT may be preferable to no ECT. Examples of  such situations are those in which ECT is strongly indicated but  anaesthesiological facilities are unavailable or unaffordable; in such  situations, the expected gains with ECT are likely to far exceed the risks with  unmodified treatments. The stage is now set for a systematic audit of modified  as well as unmodified ECT so that better data may be made available upon which  more valid decision-making can be based.'
				</p>
				<p>
					I stand by my  statements. If Waikar et al. wish to outlaw the practice of unmodified ECT,  they may be shutting the door for effective treatment for a number of patients  who seek psychiatric care in situations in which anaes-thesiological facilities  are unavailable or unaffordable. Will Waikar <em>et al.</em> take the responsibility for  the suffering, or possible death, of these patients? I remind readers that we  are living in a country in which even minimal standards of healthcare cannot be  assured to enormous segments of the population; under these circumstances, a  sub-optimal form of treatment could be better than no treatment. On the subject  of 'sub-optimal form of treatment', I add that there is insubstantial evidence  that unmodified ECT is as bad as it is made out to be.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inevitable  conclusion is that it is necessary to objectively compare the benefits and risks  of modified and unmodified ECT, as well as patients' experiences with and  subsequent attitudes towards these two forms of treatment because, in an era of  evidence-based medicine, only when the results of such research become  available can truly informed, scientifically and ethically valid opinions be  expressed.
