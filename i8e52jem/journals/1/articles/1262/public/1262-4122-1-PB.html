					In this election year (2001), criticism by the opposition
					that there has been no increase in number of medical
					seats in West Bengal during the last 23 years of Left
					Front rule seems to have triggered off government action,
					of dubious worth. The government announced
					enhancements of 50 seats each in three rural medical colleges
					&mdash; Bankura, Burdwan and North Bengal Medical College. It
					also decided to open an undergraduate section for 50
					students in the state's only post-graduate institution, the
					Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research
					and the Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial hospital in Calcutta,
					hurriedly spending a few crore rupees to create additional
					facilities. Thereafter, it invited the Medical Council of India
					(MCI) for an inspection. The MCI came, inspected and, it is
					learned, permitted only the Burdwan medical college's extra
					seats, refusing approval to the others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Only a year earlier, the government had announced the
					creation of a fixed number of government medical teaching
					posts, on the basis of existing medical seats. In the health
					department, there are two cadres of doctors: the West Bengal
					Health Service which mans non-teaching hospitals in the
					districts, talukas and health centre, and the Medical
					Education Services (MES) to which teachers belong . The
					number of posts in the MES are fixed, and are related to MCI
					requirements which stipulate that for every 100 admissions,
					each department should have a specified number of teachers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several posts of medical teachers in various disciplines
					have been lying vacant for a long time largely because this
					is a (theoretically) non-practicing post. The increase in
					admissions has further aggravated the shortage. In order to
					meet this increased need, the health department decided to
					recruit medical teachers by organising 'walk-in interviews'
					instead of the usual procedure of selection by the Public
					Service Commission. It ensured that only doctors owing
					allegiance to the ruling party were selected. Persons with
					lesser qualifications and expertise were selected, bypassing
					deserving candidates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite these manipulations the government failed to
					recruit the requisite number of medical teachers.
					Nevertheless, it has again invited the MCI in January 2001.
					This time, to fill in vacancies in the medical colleges
					concerned, teachers from medical colleges where MCI
					inspection is not due have been transferred to hoodwink
					the inspectors by adopting the jackal and crocodile policy.
					(There is a story of the crocodile who deposited her eight
					offspring with a jackal. The jackal devoured all but one of
					them. When the crocodile came by to see her children, the
					jackal showed her the surviving baby. What about the
					others? asked the crocodile. The jackal replied, "Hold on a
					minute," went into his cave with the baby, and came out
					displaying it, pretending it was another one. He repeated
					this until he had "shown" the crocodile each of her children.)
				</p>
				<p>
					If one asks why there should be an increase in the number of medical seats, the truth is that "popular demand" calls for
					it. However, there is no survey of the current situation. How
					many seats are needed? What happens to the finished
					product? Are medical graduates gainfully employed? Is there
					a dearth of qualified medical personnel in the state?
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, there is a dearth of qualified allopathic doctors in the
					villages, but even if their number is doubled, they will remain
					in the cities and peripheries, and not go to the villages. A
					medical graduate becomes one to make money. Why do we
					expect them to go to the villages to starve? Villages cannot
					afford to give doctors the money they need. This is the
					economic explanation. The commodity goes where there is a
					market. What are a qualified person's expectations? Well, in
					the health centres, government doctors get a starting
					minimum of Rs. 13,000 monthly, as well as the money they
					make illegally from private practice. Any independent private
					doctor going to the villages will expect to make not just that
					much, but more &ndash; to provide for a pension when s/he retires.
					Of course, there are also local, non-allopathic doctors, with
					lower expectations, who cater to the community and charge
					less. Otherwise, there are very few villages in most parts of
					the country, let alone in West Bengal, that can pay private
					doctors according to their expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand, in places where you can assure a private
					doctor Rs.30,000 - 50,000 a month, you will find that many
					doctors will go there, even without other incentives or with
					poor living conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
					This brings us back to the fact that there has not been any
					assessment of the need for new doctors. At the same time,
					there is no enhancement in the number of posts for
					government doctors. Given the current structural adjustment
					programme and lowering of government spending, it is
					unlikely that new posts will be created for government
					doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					So what will happen to the doctors created by these new
					seats? Who will they serve? Again, only the private sector,
					and only in those areas where they are assured to making
					money. So the government spends many crores of rupees to
					make a doctor only for the private sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					If we examine the present education system, we can see
					how it has deteriorated. There is a lack of supervision
					compared to 30-40 years ago. Standards are plummeting.
					Now medical colleges are unable to even fill up their required
					teaching posts, teachers are already in short supply because
					these posts are non-practising posts &ndash; at least on paper. So
					several of them lie vacant. Despite this situation, colleges
					are increasing the number of medical seats without making
					arrangements for new teaching posts, or knowing where the
					teachers will come from &mdash; just to counter political pressures
					in an election year. Although th MCI's inspectors denied
					permission for enhanced seats this time, who knows &ndash; they
					may give their approval the next time they are asked.
