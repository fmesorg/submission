					Laparoscopic  sterilisation has been made available in India since the 1970s. This procedure  requires high skill on the part of the surgeon and can be performed as an  outpatient procedure. In the absence of reliable spacing methods, it is  believed that women find this method convenient as it takes little time and  also leaves a very small physical scar. Since the early 1980s, this method of  female sterilisation has become the mainstay of India's family planning  programme. It is provided in camps as well as in health centres.
				</p>

				<p>
					Keeping in view the need to maintain aseptic procedures and safeguard patients  from hepatitis and HIV infection, the government issued guidelines relating to  the cleaning and use of laparoscopes. According to the guidelines, laparoscopes  are to be washed and dried after each operation and immersed in Cidex solution  for at least 30 minutes. This implies that a surgeon using two laparoscopes can  perform a maximum of 25 operations in one working day of eight hours. <em>(source:  letter from ministry of health and family welfare dated September 23, 1993,  quoted in Ramanathan et al in Reproductive Health Matters November 1995).</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					In the post-Cairo period, under the new RCH approach, the government issued  guidelines with regard to client screening - taking medical history, basic  physical examination and laboratory examination for haemoglobin, blood sugar  and albumin. Patients are also expected to be given clear pre-and  post-operative instructions. The operation is to be followed by strict  monitoring for three hours followed by three visits by the ANM at stipulated  intervals.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the last three years, researchers have observed sterilisation camps in many  states. Some common observations made by them:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						General infrastructure facilities  are very poor. There is little drinking water or water for medical teams to  wash their hands. Toilet facilities are poor.
					</li>
					<li>
						Women queue up, and wait up to even four hours.
					</li>
					<li>
						Women are huddled together in makeshift tents with poor hygiene and almost no  privacy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Few pelvic examinations are done. By and large doctors do not take medical  histories. (There were cases reported where women were not even asked if they  had undergone an abortion in the last 24 hours. Ramanathan et al report that  given the pressure of work, women go for an abortion and come directly to a  sterilisation camp. Similar cases have also been observed in Rajasthan.)
					</li>
					<li>
						Urine samples are tested in most of the camps, primarily to test for pregnancy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Women are asked to walk up to the operation table, lie down head downwards on  benches with some help from female or even male workers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Women are prepared for the operation (swabbed and cleaned, local anaesthesia  given, tubes inserted, abdomen inflated) on the table and again there is little  privacy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Innumerable  operations are performed in one day. In most cases, the laparoscope is not  immersed in Cidex solution. Doctors do not change their gloves after each  operation; the rubber sheet used on the operation table is also not changed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Women are helped down from the table and asked to walk or are carried to a  post-operative room/tent. Hygiene is poor and again, there is little privacy.  They are attended to by ANMs/staff nurses. Unless there is evidence of a  complication women do not see the doctor again.
					</li>
					<li>
						The women are not counselled about post-operative care and symptoms of  complications. There is hardly any verbal communication between the women and  the nurses / ANMs. They are given antibiotic tablets and asked to go home.
					</li>
					<li>
						After resting a while, women walk back to take buses/ jeeps/ tempos to reach  home.
					</li>
					<li>
						Follow-up care is entrusted to ANMs. In some states, women have reported that  ANMs visit them three times in quick succession - in two or three days.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The most worrisome aspect is the attitude of service providers. They treat the  clients with little regard for human dignity. Unfortunately, even women doctors  do not treat their clients differently.
				</p>
				<p>
					While there may be some variations across states, the above description is  quite representative of what happens in sterilisation camps. During discussions  with administrators and technical people in the government, most agreed that  the situation in the camps was far from desirable, admitting that it was a  dehumanizing experience - not only for the clients but even for sensitive  service providers. The following reasons were cited by administrators in many  states as factors responsible for this situation
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Camps are normally organised between December and March each year. Funds are  transferred in the last quarter of the financial year - putting pressure on the  health delivery system to pack a year's work in three months.
					</li>
					<li>
						If laparoscopic sterilisation is made available on one day of the week in a  routine manner, such poor service delivery can be avoided. Unfortunately, this  is not possible (at least in the more backward states) because trained surgeons  are not available in every district There are many districts in UP, Rajasthan  and MP where there is not even one lady doctor or a trained surgeon. Therefore,  the state government has little option but to organise camps.
					</li>
					<li>
						The health delivery system has never laid any importance on provider client  interaction. This attitude is not typical of the health care system alone; it  is the same in all public sector services.
					</li>

					<li>
						Many administrators and service providers believe women are the culprits - that  they produce too many children. This is a mind set that will take many years to  change.
					</li>

					<li>
						Unfortunately, even in the post Cairo period where quality is given so much  importance, no one is looking at quality of care in sterilisation camps.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					It is more than apparent that there is a huge gap between policy-level  intentions and government of India guidelines and the ground reality. While  officers in the government of India acknowledge the need to improve quality of  care, operationalising it is bound to be an uphill task.

				<h4>Population  control raises hackles</h4>
				<p>
					A bill  introduced in the Delhi State Assembly seeks to deny ration cards to families  exceeding the two-child norm. It also demands that families which exceed the  norm be punished by denial of bank loans, enrollment in government housing  schemes and cooperative societies and the parents lose the right to contest  civic body elections.
				</p>
				<p>
					"The bill is wholly misconceived, unconstitutional and  discriminatory and also objectionably elitist in its assertions," said Suhasini  Ali, former member of Parliament and activist with the All India Democratic  Women's Association. The bill flies in the face of commitments by India to  agreements at the International Conference on Population and Development at  Cairo in 1994 and the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing the next  year. Since then, on paper, the country's family welfare programmes have  increased funding for reproductive health and tried to expand the range of  services while trying to limit population size.
				</p>
				<p>
					But according to the Voluntary  Health Association of India (VHAI), the new policy directives have failed to  reach the grassroots level. Says VHAI's Mira Shiva, "the government must get  out of the sterilisation trap of which the Department of Family Welfare is  itself the main victim."
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Shiva, doing away with the department  would be a good beginning. According to Shiva, the infant mortality rate in  India at 74 per thousand is still too high to expect people to take the two-child norm seriously. "There is no question of a poor woman agreeing to have only  two children when she knows that both of them may die of some disease or the  other," she said. "Basic survival, potable water, proper sanitation and  affordable health care have to be the crux of any population policy."
