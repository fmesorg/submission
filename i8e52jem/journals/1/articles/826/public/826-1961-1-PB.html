					It must  have been difficult to work with a tribal community as Mr Rajan Patil has. The  questions he asks are valid and tricky to resolve or reach a consensus on. The  researcher's willingness to speak on these problems in the public domain must  be appreciated; such dilemmas are often not even acknowledged publicly, let  alone discussions being generated around them. However, the presentation also  indicates that steps could have been taken to make this research ethically more  sound. The following issues emerge.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Adequacy  of information</h4>
				<p>
					Were research participants provided with essential and adequate information?  The account indicates that the informed consent form had information on the  purpose of the study and possible risks involved. However, it is not clear  whether other important information was communicated to prospective research  participants to facilitate their decision-making. These include: the number of  blood samples to be taken; who would have access to the samples; for how long  the samples would be preserved; whether the samples would be used for future  research; disposal of the samples, possible benefits of participating other  than treatment and, the most important, their right to withdraw or decline to  participate.
				</p>

				<h4>Community  consent</h4>
				<p>
					Can community leaders' consent substitute for that of individual research  participants? In traditional tribal communities, community leaders, who are  selected by community members, are expected to hold that position with the  prime aim of serving their community. The relationship between the community  leader and members, ideally speaking, is that of mutual trust. However, it  could become paternalistic and authoritarian. Thus, it can be disastrous to  make general assumptions about community leadership. Any researcher working  with communities, tribal or rural, must understand the social organisation of  the community before even planning the research.
				</p>
				<p>
					At  different levels, non-formal (traditional) or formal community leaders, family  elders, husbands and mothers-in-law can all be gatekeepers, whom researchers  must approach before seeking access to individual married woman. The challenge  is to be respectful to the community culture and any other protocols, without  violating principles of research ethics. Thus, while there are guidelines,  there are no set procedures for facilitating the informed decision-making  process. Individual researchers and research teams must develop  situation-specific strategies, which ensure compliance with ethical guidelines  in their spirit. Often, there are no clear solutions to ethical dilemmas and  there can be multiple perspectives. What is needed is sound ethical reasoning.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case, the researcher felt the need to comply with cultural practices  and the ethics advisors insisted on compliance with ethical guidelines. The  problem was resolved without a critical look at either cultural or ethical  norms, and without a creative operationalising of the ethical guidelines. The  fact that research participants offered their written consent demonstrates that  the researchers' initial thinking was unjustified.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  article also raises some other issues. For example, the procedure and interview  were conducted in public spaces. This raises questions about the need to  maintain privacy.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Service  provision and inducement</h4>
				<p>
					By providing health services to both participants and non-participants, the  researcher abided by the ethical principle of <em>justice.</em> Providing health  services to research participants does not amount to inducement, and since this  service was not a pre-condition for participating in the study, it therefore  does not amount to violating autonomous voluntary participation.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  might be helpful to remember that conceptualising research designs and methods  of facilitating individuals' decision-making requires an understanding of the  community, its social organisation and the local dynamics. Second, gatekeepers'  approval must not be considered equivalent to the consent of prospective  individual research participants. Finally, shortage of time in field-based  research cannot be a justification for short-cuts, especially in seeking  informed consent and other aspects of the ethical conduct of research.
