				<h4>A morale-booster from  an eminent ethicist</h4>
				<p>
					I just noticed that you have an email address. So I take this opportunity to  express my sincere thanks to you and the Editorial Board for sending me the  journal of medical ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is certainly getting better and better. You  are all doing a wonderful job, and I feel it was high time that such a large  country as India have its own journal on the moral dilemmas of medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Congratulations! Keep up the good work. If by  any chance my standard of living elevates to the level of a simple bank clerk  then you may expect a financial contribution to the journal even from me!
