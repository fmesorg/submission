				</p>
				<p>
					In this globalised  and market-oriented world, there is a tendency to commodify everything and this  includes human organs. Everything must be viewed in a detached and 'objective'  manner and should not be adulterated with any values.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately human  life and living do not work that way, and more so in our part of the world. In  the real world things are not black and white but there are many shades of  grey. One example with which we have had experience for a number of years is  blood donation. Professional blood donation was permitted and had become quite  messy but it took the HIV/AIDS scare to put a stop to it, at least officially.  Voluntary blood donation is encouraged and whenever a patient needs blood,  relatives and friends must contribute without any monetary compensation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why can't we follow  the same principle for kidney donation? Encourage people to donate their  kidneys on death to a public 'kidney bank'. Anyone needing a transplant must  get a relative or friend to pledge their kidneys on death. The option of a live  donation from a compatible relative may also be kept open as an exception, but  this should be subject to an ethical review to assure that no undue advantage  is taken, or any payment made. And of course this should be only in the public  domain. (By public domain I do not necessarily mean the government, it could  also be an association of the concerned profession.)
				</p>
				<p>
					This is not very  different from the question of the misuse of amniocentesis. Just because the  technology is misused, we cannot ban it since it also serves a useful purpose.  There has to be control over the use of the technology by the profession. We  know that legislation in the case of amniocentesis has not worked effectively.  It can only work if the medical profession becomes ethical in its use and any  misuse is dealt with severely by professional bodies. For example, the  Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) should  take a lead and pressurise its fraternity to stop sex-determination tests. The  fact that FOGSI has not done this shows the lack of ethical concern within the  association. On the positive side, there has been a report from Bhuj that  prescriptions and other stationery used by obstetricians and gynaecologists in  that region carry a slogan that sex-determination is a crime. FOGSI must use  such examples to advantage and get its members and other related specialists to  become concerned and bring about a change in practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming back to the  kidney trade, there is also the concern of inadequate access to dialysis  facilities for affected patients. With increasing privatisation the situation  is becoming worse. Access to such care for the poor, who are the majority in  this country, is becoming increasingly out of reach. If we are concerned about  equity &mdash; and we ought to be, given that we are a society with an exceptionally  large population with insufficient access to basic needs including health care  &mdash; then we ought to be concerned about the increasing commodification of health  care. Public investment is declining and the private sector is booming. It was  not very long ago that specialist care was largely in the public domain but  today even that is being monopolised by the private sector. If things continue  in the same vein then arguments in favour of allowing free trade in human  organs will gain momentum.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thus we must view the  human organ trade in the context of this overall political economy of health  care. If we allow the organ trade we will be favouring a small class of people  who can buy out the desperate poor. It will also create its own economy of  middlemen who will facilitate this trade. Experience teaches us that whenever  such middlemen take over, the beneficiary is neither the buyer nor the seller.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case there is  a third loser &ndash; the medical professionwhich is fast losing its  credibility because of the large number of unethical practices which increasingly  characterise it. We are fortunate that a large majority of the medical  profession world wide is either against the human organ trade or at best  ambivalent.
				</p>
				<p>
					So we do have a hope  that the <em>banias</em> can be prevented from taking over control of human organs. However,  this will depend entirely on the ethical standards medical professionals set  for themselves.
