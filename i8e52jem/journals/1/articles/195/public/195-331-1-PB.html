					I visited the doc, was feeling quite ill...
					<br />
					Hoping for comfort or maybe a pill
					<br />
					Was taken by surprise when he barely did glance,
					<br />
					To explain my ailment, hardly gave me a chance!
					<br />
					<br />
					Papers in a sheaf were handed to me
					<br />
					Blood tests and a scan, even a CT!
					<br />
					For over a day I ran from pillar to pole
					<br />
					The bills in my pocket - they burnt a hole.
					<br />
					<br />
					The reports he scanned and shook his head
					<br />
					"Hmmm...let's try a new drug instead.&rdquo;
					<br />
					Each pill from which, I was to learn,
					<br />
					Pharma and doc, more cash would earn.
					<br />
					<br />
					For a 'second opinion' to a friend he sent
					<br />
					Upon meeting whom, I was quick to repent.
					<br />
					Merit aside, a degree he'd bought.
					<br />
					Of medical ken, he knowledge had not!
				</p>
				<p>
					"Our system is foul!" I winced in pain.
					<br />
					'It's no wonder we face a brain drain.
					<br />
					Diligently those who honour their seat
					<br />
					Earn barely enough to make ends meet
					<br />
					<br />
					With generous compensation, the corporates entice
					<br />
					For questionable ethics - humanity pays the price.
					<br />
					I had reckoned this to be a noble profession.
					<br />
					It's become a business is my honest confession.
					<br />
					<br />
					Of medical men, if this be the plight
					<br />
					An ignorant man would be a doctor's delight!
					<br />
					For, when I sought treatment for a simple flu,
					<br />
					Was he too busy to realise...
					<br />
					I was a doctor too?
