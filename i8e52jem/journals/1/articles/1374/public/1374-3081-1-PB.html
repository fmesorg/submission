					The patient was lying  curled up in bed, with her husband and sister in attendance. In a very feeble  voice she informed me that there was a fire in her stomach. The attending  doctor told me that she had advanced AIDS and was suffering from acute  cytomegalovirus (CMV), meningitis, and other severe complications. They had  begun treatment for CMV, but there was no provision for ARV drugs. Since I had  nothing to offer in terms of medical advice, I stepped back to talk to the two  student doctors, Bharat and Veena.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bharat told me that the husband claimed that the patient had received blood  transfusion during surgery 9 and again 5 years ago. She had fallen sick some  weeks ago, was an in-patient for 18 days at a small town hospital where  doctors failed to diagnose the disease, and finally was brought here. Bharat  suspected that the husband, even though still healthy, had been infected first.
				</p>
				<p>
					We went into a side room to talk. Before I knew it, and in part due to my  enthusiasm, I was faced with counselling the family. The husband said he had  been told that his wife had AIDS, and wanted to know if she would get well.  Fumbling for words, I informed him that it was likely that she would recover  from this particular infection but would be sick again. The best guess was that  she had three to six months to live. I assured them that the hospital would  provide the best care but the disease was incurable. In a meek and low voice  the husband asked if this was the disease they had heard of on TV. I could  barely open my mouth to say yes.
				</p>
				<p>
					With a great deal of hesitation the husband asked whether he should bring his  wife back to the hospital if she fell sick again. Underlying the question was  the financial hardship of hospitalisation. The sister broke down at this point  and he asked her to leave the room. Bharat told the husband that the hospital  would care for his wife, but it was clear that he was not thinking of the cost.  At this point I took it upon myself to counsel him. Yes, the hospital would  take care of his wife if and when she fell sick, but without the  anti-retroviral drug therapy, whose cost was completely out of their reach, one  could not tackle the underlying HIV infection. Hospital care could, perhaps,  buy her an extra month, but he should weigh that against the costs. She may be  equally well, or even better, served at home by their love and care during her  last months. Bharat and Veena nodded in agreement. The final decision was his &mdash;  hospitalisation or home care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The consideration that led me to this course of advice were the following: The  husband's monthly wages were Rs. 3000, whereas each hospitalisation was costing  Rs. 20,000 to 30,000. To pay these bills they would have to borrow from loan  sharks who charge interest rates of up to 100 percent. Very often families in  such situations are forced to sell their children to the sex industry or as  bonded child labor. One is, therefore, forced to decide between the best  possible care for a loved one versus the ruin of the rest of the family and  possible victimisation of the children! It is clear that society will have to  repeatedly grapple with such ethical questions as the number of AIDS cases  increase.
				</p>
				<p>
					The last question we discussed was who should be tested for HIV. The attending  doctor, to provide complete mental satisfaction, had recommended all, the  husband and the four children, again without considering the cost (Rs. 450 per  person). Since the youngest child was 11 years old, all the children were very  healthy, and considering the low risk of transmission from mother to them while  tending their cuts and bruises, I did not think it necessary to test the  children, and told him so. This raises an ethical question: how should doctors  balance family's financial hardships versus care in such terminal cases?
				</p>
				<p>
					As we got up to leave, the husband thanked me for being honest, and we  perceived a certain calm in his manner. He reiterated that he would provide all  the love and care for his wife, and we, that the hospital would do its best.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many questions that still haunt me. Had we given the right advice?  Should HIV patients with essentially no immune system left and with infectious  diseases like TB be treated in common general wards, hoping that none of the  other patients contract TB or vice-versa? Or are HIV patients, with no access  to ARV drugs, better off with home care? Had we convinced the family that HIV  has no cure and to not waste money on quacks with miracle cures?
				</p>
				<p>
					This is but one example  of the social and medical cost heaped upon us by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We will  increasingly be faced with similar gut wrenching stories. How will we keep our  sanity when these stories become millions of similar stories, all with the same  tragic conclusion?
