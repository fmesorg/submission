				<h4>Testing patients for HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Regarding  Dr V Raman Kutty's article on ethics in public health practice <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Raman Kutty V. Ethics in public health practice. Issues in Medical Ethics2000: 111-112." id="1">(1)</a>, I  beg to differ with the author with respect to the following statement:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Perhaps they  forget that the patient has an equal right to know the HIV status of their  health practitioner, since it is a well known route of spread."
				</p>
				<p>
					May I ask the  author where he got this reference from? I believe that such reciprocal transmission  is yet to be reported in case of HIV.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have a few  other points to raise. Why is there such secrecy about AIDS? Would you not like  to know overall incidence and prevalence of HIV-infected patients in the  region? If you don't have the statistics, how do you understand the extent of  the epidemic? How are you going to fight it on a war footing if you don't even  know (or want to know) statistics of infected individuals? If acute polio can  be a notifiable disease, why not HIV? How ethical is it for an individual who  has acquired HIV from other sources to knowingly infect his wife who is  ignorant of his status? Is there any insurance policy or a job security for an  individual who acquired the infection accidentally while serving humanity?  There are no easy answers to these questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel there  are many misperceptions and much hypocrisy when we talk about treating the HIV  patient ethically. We need to change the overall attitude of society towards  HIV patients. I fully agree with the concept that under no circumstance should  there be discrimination against AIDS patients. However, I do not agree that HIV  testing should not be made routine before any intervention. I can defend my  statement for the reason that even the largest public hospitals in India will  not be able to afford the expenses of medical and paramedical staff taking  universal precautions for all patients routinely.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me quote  the British Orthopaedic Association's recommendations on what should be worn by  the surgical team for the prevention of HIV and Hepatitis infection in  operation theatres (these are only excerpts):
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Protection  of face and head:</em> 1. Full eye protection goggles or  visor, not spectacles; 2. Closely fitting hood of finely woven material, or  disposable paper, covering the neck; 3. Ventilated hood or gown in high risk  cases. (<em>comment: these are currently not available in India</em>).
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Gowns</em>: cotton gowns are not acceptable. Wrapover type of adequate  length gown made up of high quality disposable paper, preferably laminated at  the front and sleeves. They should be of a fabric with proven resistance to  strike through.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Gloves</em>: Double gloving with cotton outer gloves. Frequent changes  of the outer gloves are recommended.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Foot protection</em>: Wellington boots impervious to  penetration, knee high, well overlapped by the gown.
				</p>
				<p>
					In every case  these precautions are obviously not practical. The question here is, are we  well equipped and ready to treat HIV cases in epidemic proportions?
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors are  like soldiers on the battlefield. Their dedication, commitment and sincerity  should not be questioned. Are we going to ask our soldiers to lay their lives  without arming them adequately for the fight against the very strong enemy?  Denying the obvious fact that most public hospitals do not have these amenities  is like pulling a hood over one's eyes. Also, there is no quality control over  the 'HIV kit' they provide the staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical issues  need to be re-examined in this perspective.
