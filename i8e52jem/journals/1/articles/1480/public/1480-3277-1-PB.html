				<h4>Operation successful patient died</h4>
				<p>
					On October 5, the CDR hospitals at Chennai held a press conference to announce  'the creation of medical history' &mdash; on September 29, a patient with end stage  renal disease received a cadaver kidney which had been flown in from  Hyderabad.. They did not mention that the patient died four days before the  press conference. The doctor, K S Nayak, later apologised for omitting this  crucial fact, and explained that he had organised the press conference because  the cadaver transplant was a significant medical event deserving public  attention. Both hospital and doctor asserted that the transplant was successful  even if the patient died. The patient's relatives paid Rs 1.5 lakh to the  hospital and Rs 60,000 to Tanuja Airways for a chartered flight. They also say  they have a receipt of Rs 10,000 from the hospital for courier charges, though  the courier company says they did not receive any payment for transporting the  kidney.

				<h4>Vaccination melas</h4>
				<p>
					0n any  given weekend between 35 and 40 mass vaccination camps are being held in the  city of Bangalore. While some are organised by reputed service organisations,  leading doctors and vaccine manufacturers worry that the camps are not always  held under proper supervision, with the right doses. Paediatricians suggest  that the vaccine should be used for selective risk groups like medical and  dental personnel, and as an optional vaccine for the newborn and children Are  the right amounts being injected? Not necessarily. Are they being given in the  correct manner? Not always.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are  people made aware that the vaccine is of no use unl'ess the three dose regimen  is completed? Apparently not. Do they know that older people benefit much less  than children do? No. And the vaccines are not being given free.

				<h4>What do you think?</h4>
				<p>
					On  March 12, V N Prakash donated one of his kidneys to his brother V. N.  Subramanyam at the Karnataka Nephrology and Transplant Institute, Bangalore. As  a blood relative, Prakash is eligible to be a kidney donor. Only problem is: he  is mentally disabled, deaf and mute, and could not have given his informed,  convincing and meaningful consent to the donation which saved his brother's  life. His guardian and mother gave consent on his behalf.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tissue  matching found that Prakash was the perfect donor. Subramanyam is the only  earning member of his family, works in a printing press earning Rs 800 a week,  barely enough to meet the needs of his family consisting of him, his brother,  mother, wife and child.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  team of surgeons took the decision to operate after soliciting responses to  this situation, on the internet.

				<h4>CDC didn't follow the rules</h4>
				<p>
				<em>The US  Centers for Disease Control (CDC) conducted medical research. projects in  foreign countries without required agreements to avoid human rights abuses. In  a number of instances, drugs were given, samples taken and research completed  without the required agreements that patients were fully informed, monitored  for safety told of known treatments and free to refuse experimental drugs.  Among the violutions cited: children getting malaria drugs in Zambia and  Malawi, whose guardians didn't know they were getting experimental drugs;  consent forms &mdash; but not in the local language for parents of babies vaccinated  for diphtheria and meningitis, consent forms jbr rabies vaccine trials in  Ethiopia not translated. The CDC's deputy associate director jar science said the  CDC was confident no subjects were harmed; language differences make it hard,  and some countries object to the US imposing its own ethics rules abroad.</em> </p>

				<h4>Doctors charged with torture</h4>
				<p>
			    <em>Brazil  is to try a group o. f doctors charged with collaborating in torture carried  out by the military regime that ruled from I964 to 1985. It is the first time  doctors will have been called to account in this way since the Nuremberg trials  after the Second World War The 26 accused, who include some of the most  respected members of Brazil's medical profession, are accused of assisting in  torture sessions, giving directions to the torturers and signing false death  certtficates.</em></p>
				<p><em>The disciplinary proceedings, which began March 3 and are  expected to continue through the year; are a result of a 13-year effort by the  Brazilian human rights organization Torture Never Again. The group asked  medical associations to revoke the licenses of110 doctors implicated by  former political prisoners in violations. Some doctors have died and others  been able to block the investigations against them. The remaining 26 face being  struck off the medical register and the possibility of criminal proceedings. In  the first of the cases heard, gynaecologist Jose Lino Coutinho, accused of  overseeing the torture of 11 political prisoners in 1969, had his license  revoked. </em></p>

				<h4>Nestle ''went too far''</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The  Advertising Standards Authority has upheld a complaint against Nestle over its  marketing of infant formula in developing countries. The complaint concerned a  I996 newspaper advertisement in which Nestle' claimed that it had marketed  infant formula "ethically and responsibly both before and since the  introduction of the international code of marketing of breast milk substitutes  in 1981. The standards authority's ruling, which has not been oficially  released pending an appeal by Nestle, found that Nestle could not adequately  support its claims and that the advertisement "went too far"

				<p><em>
				  The  original complaint was brought by Baby Milk Action,a non-profit organisation  which campaigns against inappropriate infant feeding, objecting to an  advertisement in the oxford Independent, a student neivspaper that was  published in 1996. The standards authority examined submissions from Baby Milk  Action and Nestle for nearly two years. Mike Brady,campaign coordinator for  Baby Milk Action, said: Nestle's challenges delayed the case progressing to the  [authority's] council. A spokeswomen for Nestle said: "We don't think it is  appropriate to comment as the matter is under appeal"</em>

Ninety per cent of patients in a neonatal intensive care unit in  the east Midlunds were given drugs that were either unlicensed or used in ways  other than those for which they had been tested &mdash; termed "of label  use". Only just over one third of prescriptions given to the70  babies admitted over 13 weeks were for licensed drugs used in a licensed way,  the research showed, including nine of the 10 most commonly prescribed drugs in  neonatal intensive care (Archives of Disease in Childhood (fetal and neonatal  edition) 1991;80:142-4F).

				<h4>Still "discussing" the  complaint</h4>
				<p>
					More  than five years have passed since a Bangalore-based woman was molested by a  doctor on the pretext of examining her for a sexually transmitted disease, but  the Karnataka Medical Council is still "discussing" the couple's complaint.  When the man went to the doctor for a skin irritation, the doctor sent him to a  local diagnostic center, which falsely stated that the man had an STD. The  doctor moleted the woman twice on the pretext of examining. The couple become  suspicious and went to two other doctors who told them they were completely  healthy, and they complained to the Karnataka Medical Council. However, after  various deliberations, there has been no word from the Council since February  1998.

				<h4>Codeine: the latest best-seller</h4>

				<em>The  South Asia Drug Demand Reduction report, of the United Nations Internatio-nal  Drug Control Programme, states that over-the-counter drugs are seriously  misused across India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The biggest threat is the mounting  misuse of pharmaceutical agents like buprenorphine, diazepam, antihistamines,  and cough syrups containing codeine. India accounts for nearly 3 million drug  misusers. India's pharmaceutical industry produces large amounts of  psychotropic substances for medicinal purposes. But, the report said, they are  sold without valid prescriptions, illegally transported to neighbouring  countries, ancl sold for profit.</em>,'</p>

				<h4>HIV vaccine trials</h4>
				<p>
				<em>The  first clinical trial of an HIV vaccine in Africa has been launched in Uganda,  to evaluate the safety and durability of immune response to a vaccine based on  an attenuated canarypox virus. </em></p>
				<p><em>
				  Researchers  involved in phase-I of the double-blind trial are enrolling 40 healthy, HIV-negative adults aged 18 to 40 years who are at low risk of becoming HIV  infected. They will be assigned randomly to a group of 20 who will receive the  HIV vaccine, 10 controls who receive an experimental canarypox vaccine for rabies,  or 10 controls who will receive a placebo injection. The trial will last one  year with an additional year of follow-up to monitor adverse effects and  immune responses. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is  sponsoring the trial.
				</em></p>
				<p><em>
			    Separately,  another group announced large-scale efficacy tests of a second vaccine in  Thailand. The vaccine is designed to protect against two strains of HIV  prevalent in Thailand and will be administered to 2500 intravenous drug users  in Bangkok who are healthy but have a high risk of infection. The company will  also test a similarly engineered vaccine on 5000 volunteers in the United  States, making this the first vaccine to enter the final efficacy phase of  human testing.</em> </p>
