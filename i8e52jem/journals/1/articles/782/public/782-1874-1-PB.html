				<h4>Intensive care units and ethical issues</h4>
				<p>
					The October&ndash;December 2003 issue of IME carried two
					interesting articles <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baretto Z. Ethical issues in palliative care. Issues in Medical Ethics. 2003;11:118&ndash;19. " id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shah K. The friend. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:120&ndash;1." id="2">2)</a> that raise some interesting questions.
					Prolonging life at any cost in the terminal state is definitely
					not justified. Medical practioners have subtly practised this
					art of palliation where prolongation of life is abrogated,
					with or without legal sanctions. Withholding any supportive
					treatment, for example, a gastrostomy in oesophageal cancer,
					needs an explicit consent from the patient. Withholding
					nourishment in a patient with an obstructed oesophagus
					due to cancer and who may live for few months even without
					treatment, is tantamount to starvation and is bound to be
					construed as cruel, unethical and illegal.

					Barreto <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Baretto Z. Ethical issues in palliative care. Issues in Medical Ethics. 2003;11:118&ndash;19. " id="1">(1)</a> correctly states, 'It is ethical to withdraw lifesustaining
					treatments from those unable to decide for
					themselves, only when the treatment can no longer achieve
					its intended clinical purpose and cannot provide any
					benefit.' Indeed it is laudable to help patients live with
					dignity till the last breath. But does the law of the land
					permit anyone to be take off the life-supporting system
					even before the patient is dead? Similarly, in the article,
					'The friend', one gets an impression that the patient's relatives
					took the decision to switch the ventilator off without having
					the power of attorney to do so <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shah K. The friend. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:120&ndash;1." id="2">(2)</a>. The pertinent question is
					also about switching off the ventilator without any objective
					evidence of brain death. I wonder what the legal stand is on
					this issue of switching off ventilators at will. I hope the
					future issues of the journal will discuss these matters.

			<h4>Informed consent-a view from the trenches</h4>
			<p>
				I read with interest the deliberations of two MBBS students
				on informed consent <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dangayach N, Joshi N. Informed consent: consent with a view. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:86." id="3">(1)</a>. They state that for a consent to
				be legally valid, it must be both, informed and intelligent.
				They further point out many fallacies and loopholes that
				exist in the process of making the patient understand the
				implications of a proposed clinical manoeuvre. They state
				that lack of intelligence, communication barriers,
				unpredictable course of the illness or 'motivated'
				interests, all hamper the true spirit of 'informed consent'.
			</p>
			<p>
				A recent report <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B, Raveendran R, Pandian DG, Sujindra S. Recruitment of subjects for clinical trials after informed consent: Does gender and educational status make a difference? J Postgrad Med 2003;49:110&ndash;13." id="4">(2)</a> on the study of patient factors affecting
				the process of informed consent in a proposed clinical trial reported some interesting results. Only 30% of the subjects
				gave consent for the trial, irrespective of the quantum of
				information given (complete or partial). Of those who gave
				consent, the understanding of the elements of consent was
				poor, irrespective of the subjects' educational status. Such
				poor understanding of the information given to subjects of a
				clinical trial before they consent to participate has been
				reported in other countries as well <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gitanjali B, Raveendran R, Pandian DG, Sujindra S. Recruitment of subjects for clinical trials after informed consent: Does gender and educational status make a difference? J Postgrad Med 2003;49:110&ndash;13." id="4">(2)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my own clinical practice, I find that most patients are
				unable to understand completely, the 'fine print' about a
				proposed clinical manoeuvre. Indeed, they cannot be
				expected to do so, as they are completely uninitiated to
				medical jargon. Why, even doctors when they come as
				patients, fail to comprehend completely the nuances of their
				proposed treatment. Hence, often, patients refuse to listen
				to a detailed description of their planned treatment and
				prefer to leave the decisions to the physician in good faith. It
				is, indeed, ultimately a matter of trust and integrity. Patients
				prefer to be treated by the physicians they trust and it is
				incumbent upon the physician to prove this faith. As
				physicians we must be ready to make decisions for patients.
				Actually, this is something that all of us do every time. For
				example, we decide which investigation modalities are
				necessary for a particular patient. We decide on the drugs to
				give to a particular patient. Several medication alternatives
				often exist for a given illness but, it is the physician who
				chooses the drug and not the patient. It would be ridiculous
				to discuss every drug with the patient and leave him to
				choose his own medicines. Why, in principle, it would indeed
				be a breach of the trust the patient has in his doctor.
			</p>
			<p>
				I agree with the medical students when they say that
				consent must be individualised in every case. The idea is
				to make the patient a participant in his treatment and not
				thrust the treatment upon him. But, the spirit of consent
				must prevail at all times. The 'fine print' in writing is
				important in a court of law. But in the court of human
				mind, it is the benevolent intention that is important. Such
				intentions must precede and preside over all technicalities.
