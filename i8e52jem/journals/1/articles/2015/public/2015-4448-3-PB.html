				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					When addressing toxins, one unmistakable parallel exists between
biology and politics: developing children and developing nations
are those most vulnerable to toxic exposures. This disturbing
parallel is the subject of this critical review, which examines the use
and distribution of the mercury (Hg)-based compound, thimerosal,
in vaccines. Developed in 1927, thimerosal is 49.55% Hg by weight
and breaks down in the body into ethyl-Hg chloride, ethyl-Hg
hydroxide and sodium thiosalicylate. Since the early 1930s, there
has been evidence indicating that thimerosal poses a hazard to
the health of human beings and is ineffective as an antimicrobial
agent. While children in the developed and predominantly
western nations receive doses of mostly no-thimerosal and
reduced-thimerosal vaccines, children in the developing nations
receive many doses of several unreduced thimerosal-containing
vaccines (TCVs). Thus, thimerosal has continued to be a part of
the global vaccine supply and its acceptability as a component
of vaccine formulations remained unchallenged until 2010,
when the United Nations (UN), through the UN Environment
Programme, began negotiations to write the global, legally
binding Minamata Convention on Hg. During the negotiations,
TCVs were dropped from the list of Hg-containing products to
be regulated. Consequently, a double standard in vaccine safety,
which previously existed due to ignorance and economic reasons,
has now been institutionalised as global policy. Ultimately, the
Minamata Convention on Hg has sanctioned the inequitable
distribution of thimerosal by specifically exempting TCVs from
regulation, condoning a two-tier standard of vaccine safety: a
predominantly no-thimerosal and reduced-thimerosal standard
for developed nations and a predominantly thimerosal-containing
one for developing nations. This disparity must now be evaluated
urgently as a potential form of institutionalised discrimination.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>At its 25th session on February 29, 2009, the Governing
				  Council of the United Nations Environmental Programme
				  (UNEP) agreed to the formulation of a global, legally binding
				  instrument on mercury (Hg) and asked the executive director
				  of the UNEP to form an intergovernmental negotiating
				  committee (INC) with the mandate of preparing that
				  instrument <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environment Programme. Report of the twenty fifth session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum. Mandate.

In 2010, the INC was formed and it began<br>
				  negotiations that spanned five sessions. The legally binding instrument (eventually termed the Minamata Convention on Hg) was negotiated by the INC1 from June 7 to 11, 2010 in
				  Stockholm, Sweden; the INC2 from January 24 to 28, 2011 in
				  Chiba, Japan; the INC3 from October 31 to November 4, 2011
				  in Nairobi, Kenya; the INC4 from June 27 to July 2, 2012 in Punta
				  del Este, Uruguay; and the INC5 from January 13 to 18, 2013 in
				  Geneva, Switzerland <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environment Programme. Mercury, The negotiating process. Date unknown [cited 2014 Feb 23]. Available from: http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Mercury/Negotiations/tabid/3320/Default.aspx" id="2">(2)</a>. The text of the Minamata Convention
				  on Hg was adopted, then opened for signature at a diplomatic
				  conference in Minamata and Kumamoto, Japan from October 9
				  to 11, 2013 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environmental Programme. Minamata Convention on Mercury [Internet].

				</p>
				<p>The Minamata Convention on Hg specifically recognises that Hg, in all its forms, is a substance of global concern because it can have significant negative effects on human health. It acknowledges that this is especially relevant to developing countries, where vulnerable populations, including women and children, and through them, the future generations are more likely to be harmed through exposure to Hg<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environmental Programme.

				  result, the Minamata Convention on Hg states that its objective 
				  is to protect human health from exposure to Hg and Hg 
				  compounds. In keeping with this objective, it places extensive 
				  restrictions on the sources that supply and trade in Hg, Hgadded 
				  products, manufacturing processes in which Hg and Hg 
				  compounds are used, artisanal and small-scale gold mining, 
				  Hg emissions, and Hg wastes. Further, it mentions financial 
				  and technological resources and sets out mechanisms to 
				  avoid the use of Hg, protect vulnerable populations from Hg 
				  intoxication, facilitate the exchange of scientific information on 
				  Hg toxicity, and facilitate the education of the public and the 
				  dissemination of information to the public on Hg toxicity <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environmental Programme.

				</p>
				<p>With respect to Hg-containing products, the INC sessions
				  were tasked with developing a comprehensive and suitable
				  approach to the use of Hg that included: reducing the supply
				  of Hg and enhancing the capacity for the environmentally
				  sound storage and use of Hg; reducing the demand for Hg
				  in products and processes; reducing international trade
				  in Hg; increasing the knowledge of the use of Hg through
				  awareness-raising activities and scientific information
				  exchanges; specifying arrangements for capability-building,
				  including technical and financial assistance to developing
				  countries; and addressing the issue of compliance. Despite
				  all the aforementioned goals, in its final form, the Minamata
				  Convention on Hg exempted thimerosal-containing vaccines
			    (TCVs) from regulation.</p>
				<p>During the INC sessions, there were vigorous discussions
				  on the presence of thimerosal in the global vaccine
				  supply and intense debates over whether it would be
				  regulated or exempted from regulation in the diplomatic
				  instrument. Thimerosal (a trade name for sodium
				  ethylmercurithiosalicylate) is also known as merthiolate,
				  thiomersal, timerosal and tiomersal. Developed in 1927, it is
				  49.55% Hg by weight and is rapidly broken down into ethyl-
				  Hg chloride, ethyl-Hg hydroxide and sodium thiosalicylate in
				  aqueous saline environments, such as those found in vaccines
				  and the human body<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tan M, Parkin JE. Route of decomposition of Thiomersal (Thimerosal). Int J Pharm. 2000 Nov 4;208 (1-2):23-34." id="4">(4)</a>. Despite evidence dating back to the early 1930s that thimerosal is hazardous to human health and ineffective as an antimicrobial agent, it continued to be a part of the vaccine supply and its acceptability as a global component of vaccine formulations remained unchallenged until the INC negotiations <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Geier DA, Sykes LK, Geier MR.

The controversy surrounding thimerosal and the fact that ultimately, it was specifically exempted from regulation by the Minamata Convention on Hg must now be scrutinised as the Convention has sanctioned the continuation of the disparity, with the global distribution of TCVs remaining uneven. Since there is a discernible and inverse relationship between the wealth of a nation and the Hg content of its vaccines for children, the question of whether this disparity is ethical demands an urgent answer. </p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>A double standard in vaccine safety?</h4>
				<p>As in biology, so too in politics: just as toxic exposures affect developing children much more than mature adults, toxic exposures affect developing nations much more than developed ones. Developing nations, whose children are being exposed to Hg through the administration of vaccines at a higher rate and greater frequency than children in developed nations, risk having the intellectual potential of their next generation diminished at a point in their national development when they can least afford it. In addition, they usually lack the resources to police their borders, identify toxic products, and shift global policies that are shaped by the interests, and even the conflict of interests, of developed nations. Like children who have biologically immature detoxification systems and cannot defend themselves against the injection of thimerosal into their bodies as part of a vaccine, developing nations, with their dearth of resources, alternatives and expertise, are unable to defend themselves against toxic substances introduced through their borders due to an exemption in a diplomatic instrument. While Hg exposure is harmful in all cases, countless ethical questions arise from the fact that it is developing children in the developing nations who are disproportionately vulnerable to the potential hazards of TCVs. A notable exception is the USA where thimerosal continues to be used in inactivated influenza vaccines that may be administered to pregnant women and developing children. The reason for this, critics allege, is to justify the use of thimerosal in those developing nations where the laws and regulations are keyed to US ones. The disparity between developed and developing nations with respect to TCVs cannot be ignored in any evaluation of the historic impact, both positive and negative, of the Minamata Convention on Hg.</p>
				<p>As the Minamata Convention on Hg was being negotiated, civil society representatives from the Coalition for Mercuryfree Drugs (CoMeD), a participating non-governmental organisation (NGO) <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environmental Programme. Non Governmental Organizations [Internet]. Date unknown [cited 2014 Feb 23]. Available from: http://www.unep.org/civil-society/MajorGroups/Non-GovernmentalOrganizations/tabid/78622/Default.aspx" id="6">(6)</a>, argued that this disparity constitutes
an obviously discriminatory double standard in vaccine safety,
which some have attempted to justify <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environment Programme, Intergovermental Negotiating Committee for the Global Legally Binding Instrument on Mercury. Statement of Lisa Sykes, CoMeD [Internet]. Punta del Este, Uruguay: 2012 Jul 6 [cited 2014 Feb 23]. Available from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBOAXPrWzKA" id="7">(7)</a>. While proponents
of thimerosal acknowledged that such a disparity does,
indeed, exist between high-income countries (HICs) and
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), they offered
three main arguments to defend the exemption of TCVs from
regulation <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="King K, Paterson M, Green SK. Global justice and proposed ban on Thimerosal-containing vaccines. Pediatrics. 2013 Jan;131(1):154-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-2976. Epub 2012 Dec 17." id="8">(8)</a>. They argued that first, the use of thimerosal
as a vaccine preservative is safe, and its removal from most
of the thimerosal-preserved vaccines in the HICs was merely
precautionary. Their second argument was that cold-chain and
storage issues make it impossible to remove thimerosal from
the multi-dose vaccine formulae intended for LMICs, because
there is no “viable” alternative for thimerosal as a preservative
in these formulations. Third, they argued that justice lies in
providing the LMICs with thimerosal-containing multi-dose
vaccines rather than no vaccines at all. The validity of each of
these arguments will be evaluated.</p>
				<p>
					Before analysing these arguments, however, it is of critical
importance to make a preliminary assessment of the ultimate
“moral” conclusion predicated upon these claims [emphasis
added]: “Treating individuals with equal regard, however, does
not mean that all people are treated the same in all respects
…. It is only when differences in practice are not justified
by differences in the need and circumstances of the target
individual or group, leading to avoidable harm, that concerns
of injustice and inequality arise”
 <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="King K, Paterson M, Green SK. Global justice and proposed ban on Thimerosal-containing vaccines. Pediatrics. 2013 Jan;131(1):154-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-2976. Epub 2012 Dec 17." id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The preceding quote contains the justification mentioned
earlier – that differences in circumstance justify differences
in treatment. This argument was used by the opponents of
many historical movements for social justice in the twentieth
century <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kessler R. Long outlawed in the West, lead paint sold in poor nations [Internet]. Yale Environment 360. 2013 Mar 28 [cited 2014 Feb 23]. Available from: http://e360.yale.edu/feature/long_outlawed_in_the_west_lead_paint_sold_in_poor_nations/2633/" id="9">(9)</a>. In the case of TCVs, should the income level of a
nation impact the types of vaccine formulations it receives?
Does the low income level of a nation justify a much higher
level of a known neurotoxin in vaccines intended for its
children than the level in nations with a higher income? Are all
nations and all children not equally entitled to the protection
of the precautionary principle? And should the precautionary
principle not apply especially to those who are developing, be
they individuals or nations, given their particular vulnerability?
The argument put forward in 1934 by the US President,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, that no country, however rich,
can afford to waste its human resources, and the obvious
corollary of this argument, that every country, regardless of
how developed it is, must guard against the wasting of its
intellectual resources, must now be considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					After examining the issues of disparity, toxicity and inequity
with reference to the current distribution of thimerosal, this
critical review will consider whether the specific exemption of
TCVs from regulation, despite the fact that in many early drafts
of the treaty, they were included in a list of Hg-containing
products to be regulated, constitutes a tacit endorsement of a two-tier standard of vaccine safety based on national wealth.
If this is true, then the Minamata Convention on Hg can be
described as a historic instance of global discrimination
against developing children in developing nations and
is violating essential elements of the right to health,
including “accessibility”, as described by the United Nations
[emphasis added]: “Health facilities, goods and services
must be accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or
marginalised sections of the population, in law and in fact, <em>without discrimination..."</em> <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, United Nations Economic Social Council.

				<h4>Documenting disparity in the thimerosal content of vaccines for HICs and LMICs</h4>
				<p>
					Among the health authorities, there seems to be no dispute
that, unlike the HICs, the LMICs still receive essential
early childhood vaccines in which thimerosal is used as a
preservative or a production aid. While the disparity is widely
recognised, a nation-by-nation listing of the nominal Hg
content of all TCVs is not readily available in the public domain.
A survey of the vaccines being marketed currently, however,
allows us to make a useful comparison between the Hg
content of thimerosal in some of the vaccines distributed in
the HICs and the Hg content of similar vaccines distributed in
the LMICs. This comparison is summarised in Table 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					Opposing the regulation of TCVs by the treaty, the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a professional guild organisation
of American physicians, joined the World Health Organisation
(WHO) in urging the UN to drop the proposed regulation
because [emphasis added] “…the Thimerosal ban could
keep children <em>in poor nations</em> from getting needed vaccines" <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooper LZ, Katz SL. Ban on Thimerosal in draft treaty on mercury: why the AAP's position in 2012 is so important. Pediatrics. 2013 Jan;131(1):152-3. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-1823." id="11">(11)</a>.To justify this disparity, the AAP, in agreement with
WHO, suggested that it is essential for vaccines to contain
thimerosal. Furthermore, AAP suggested that the call it had
made in 1999 for the removal of thimerosal from vaccines as
soon as possible was a mistake. The AAP stated that on the
basis of select research conducted since 1999 <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Thimerosal in vaccines: a joint statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1999 Jul 9;48(26):563-5." id="12">(12)</a>, it would
now be inconceivable for it to join the United States Public
Health Service in issuing such a statement <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooper LZ, Katz SL. Ban on Thimerosal in draft treaty on mercury: why the AAP's position in 2012 is so important.

in direct opposition to its earlier position, the AAP publicly
argued during the INC negotiations that thimerosal must
remain in vaccines. Supporting the WHO recommendation to
delete the proposed ban on thimerosal from the drafts of the
Minamata Convention on Hg, it claimed that such a ban would
do tremendous damage to current vaccine programmes that
would otherwise protect all children from death and disability
caused by vaccine-preventable diseases <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooper LZ, Katz SL.

				<p>
					The NGOs, on the other hand, stressed that the removal of thimerosal from the early childhood vaccines in the USA <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Thimerosal in vaccines: a joint statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Public Health Service.

elevated risk of being harmed, should thimerosal pose a real
risk of harm. US health officials had anticipated this disparity
as early as 1999, when Peter Patriarca of the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) had written to Lawrence Bachorik,
predicting, “…You should also be aware that if the US (and perhaps the EU) adopts a position that the theoretical risk
of ethyl mercury exposure outweigh(s) its potential benefits
to the point where no vaccines used in the US or Europe
will contain thimerosal (which is where things appear to be
headed), this could also have a severe impact on global (‘third
world’) vaccination programmes, particularly for hepatitis B
and whole-cell DTP vaccines, which, for various reasons, will
almost certainly have to have thimerosal as an ingredient for
potentially many years to come. WHO has already made a plea
to the American Academy of Pediatrics to ‘tread lightly’ and
‘consider the global ramifications’ of their evolving policy…
I’m not sure if there will be an easy way out of the potential
perception that the FDA, CDC and immunisation policy bodies
may have been ‘asleep at the switch’ re: thimerosal until now” <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report. Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness, Committee on Government Reform, US House of Representatives. Congressional Record,, 2003 May 21, pp. E1011-E1030." id="15">(15)</a> Acknowledging on December 17, 2012 that the USA had
reduced the amount of thimerosal in most of its vaccines or
removed it altogether, Walt Orenstein, the former director
of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
National Immunization Program, admitted, “I don’t see any
reason that the US would add thimerosal back into childhood
vaccines…” <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Norton A.

Having established that there is a disparity
in the global distribution of thimerosal through TCVs to HICs
and LMICs, it is now imperative to examine the toxicity of
thimerosal and the risk it poses to those who routinely receive
TCVs in LMICs, especially developing children.

				<h4>Is thimerosal safe and was its removal from vaccines for the HICs merely precautionary?</h4>
				<h5>The US federal record on thimerosal</h5>
				<p>
					In its submission to the INC of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), a US government delegation led by
Dr John E Thompson, the Deputy Director of the Office of
Environmental Policy for the US State Department, informed
the INC delegates, “In summary, licensed vaccines containing
thimerosal preservative have been determined to be safe and
effective under the applicable US statutory and regulatory
requirements and therefore, are approved for use in the United
States” <a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Mercury Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee.

Available from: http://www.unep.org/hazardoussubstances/Portals/9/Mercury/Documents/INC3/US_information.pdf" id="17">(17)</a>. This blanket statement neither acknowledged the
availability of stocks of thimerosal-free and thimerosal-reduced
vaccines in the HICs, nor did it acknowledge other significant
and troubling federal statements that had disputed the safety
of thimerosal.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 2004, the then US Special Counsel, Scott Bloch, called for
a Congressional investigation into the use of thimerosal in
vaccines after receiving hundreds of complaints by citizens
that their children had been harmed by TCVs <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Office of Special Counsel. OSC forwards public health concerns on vaccines to Congress [Internet]. Washington: OSC; 2004 May 20 [cited 2014 Feb 23]. Available from: www.osc.gov/documents/press/2004/pr04_07.htm" id="18">(18)</a>. In contrast
to the position taken by the US delegation in its submission
to the UNEP, and after a thorough investigation into the
matter, Bloch found that “…based on the publicly available
information…, it appears there may be sufficient evidence
to find a substantial likelihood of a substantial and specific
danger to public health caused by the use of thimerosal/
mercury in vaccines because of its inherent toxicity” <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Office of Special Counsel.

Available from: www.osc.gov/documents/press/2004/pr04_07.htm" id="18">(18)</a>. Bloch
also characterised TCVs as [emphasis added] “a far-reaching
public health issue that warrants further study and awareness, particularly because it affects <em>the most vulnerable</em> among us" <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Office of Special Counsel.

was referring to foetuses and newborn infants who, because
of their rapid neurological development, immature immune,
digestive and detoxification systems, and very low body
weight, are the most susceptible to the harmful effects of a
toxic exposure at any level.
				</p>
				<p>
					The US delegation to the INC also failed to quote the findings
of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness, of the
Committee on Government Reform, United States House of
Representatives, chaired by Congressman Dan Burton. In May
2003, the subcommittee had issued a Congressional report
that stated: “Thimerosal used as a preservative in vaccines
is likely related to the autism epidemic. This epidemic in all
probability may have been prevented or curtailed had the
FDA not been asleep at the switch regarding the lack of safety
data regarding injected thimerosal and the sharp rise of infant
exposure to this known neurotoxin” <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report.

				<p>
					These official government statements cast a doubt on the
certainty with which the US delegation to the INC claimed
that thimerosal was safe. Dr Thompson acknowledged that
this claim was shaped by the stance of the US FDA, the
agency considered to be “expert” on the issue and the agency
subordinate to the US Department of Health and Human
Services, which incidentally has been the “defendant” in more
than 5000 petitions alleging vaccine-induced harm before the
US National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) <a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United States Department of Health and Human Services.

					The US delegation's claim regarding the safety of thimerosal is, in fact, far more extreme than even that of the manufacturers of thimerosal. For example, the material safety data sheet for thimerosal published by its manufacturer, Eli Lilly and Company (Indianapolis, IN, USA), reveals that the "effects of exposure may include numbness of extremities, fetal changes, decreased offspring survival, and lung tissue changes... <em>in utero</em><em>and in children</em> may cause mild to severe mental retardation and mild to severe motor coordination impairment" <a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eli Lilly and Company.

Thimerosal is so toxic that in the USA, its use as an ingredient in over-the-counter topical antiseptics, diaper-rash products and spermicides has been illegal since 1998 <a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Federal Register, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration.

				<h5>The scientific record on thimerosal</h5>
				<p>
					Neither the federal, nor the scientific record supports the
position of the health authorities involved in the UNEP
negotiations that “avoidable harm” is not associated with
TCVs. When assessing the safety of thimerosal, it is important
to remember that not even one modern human clinical safety
trial has been undertaken to evaluate it <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report. Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness, Committee on Government Reform, US House of Representatives. Congressional Record,, 2003 May 21, pp. E1011-E1030." id="15">(15)</a>. Instead, the
idea that it is “safe” is based on the findings of a single crude
human experiment which was carried out in 1929 and which
resulted in the deaths of all 22 persons to whom thimerosal
was administered <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report. Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness, Committee on Government Reform, US House of Representatives. Congressional Record,, 2003 May 21, pp. E1011-E1030." id="15">(15)</a>. While most of the subjects died within a day or two of the administration of thimerosal, the
doctor overseeing the study, financed by the patent-holding
manufacturer of thimerosal (then called merthiolate in the
USA), attributed each of these deaths to bacterial meningitis,
the condition that thimerosal was being used to treat. The
physician, Dr KC Smithburn, then declared that thimerosal
was ineffective for the treatment of meningitis but “safe”
for intravenous administration in humans, although at the
concentration used, it caused tissue death when accidentally
infused into a patient’s muscle tissue rather than a vein.
Despite Smithburn’s initial claim of “safety”, serious concerns
were raised about the use of thimerosal in serum products as
early as 1935, when the Pittman Moore company determined
that it was not suitable for use as a preservative in serum
administered to dogs <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report.

					Perhaps the most important evidence of the toxicity of
thimerosal was provided by Nelson and Gottshall from the
Division of Biologic Products, Bureau of Laboratories, Michigan
Department of Public Health (a manufacturer of pertussis
vaccines) when they assessed its safety in vaccines using
the well-established mouse toxicity test in 1967 <a class="reference" href="#twentytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nelson EA, Gottshall RY. Enhanced toxicity for mice of pertussis vaccines when preserved with Merthiolate. Appl Microbiol. 1967 May;15(3):590-3." id="22">(22)</a>. They
evaluated the toxicity of pertussis vaccines by injecting mice
intra-abdominally with a suspension of the vaccine, diluted in
physiological saline, and then observing changes in weight and
mortality. In the course of preparing and testing the vaccines,
the researchers observed that they were less toxic for mice
when diluted in saline than in saline containing thimerosal at
a final concentration of 1:10,000 (0.01%), the same nominal
concentration found in most TCVs being administered to
children today. Pertussis vaccines preserved with 0.01%
thimerosal were more toxic for mice than were unpreserved
vaccines prepared from the same parent concentrate and
containing the same number of organisms. In addition, an
increase in mortality was observed when thimerosal was
injected separately, before or after an unpreserved saline
suspension of pertussis vaccine. These results confounded
the expectations of Nelson and Gottshall because, given the
widespread use of thimerosal to preserve pertussis vaccine,
these researchers had assumed it would be safe. Such early
and substantial warnings about thimerosal seem to have
been both ignored and forgotten by those who advocate the
continued use of thimerosal in vaccines, claiming that there is
no credible scientific evidence that its use in vaccines presents
a risk to human health <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="King K, Paterson M, Green SK.

					That children are extremely sensitive to thimerosal has been
documented since at least 1977 <a class="reference" href="#twentyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Fagan DG, Pritchard JS, Clarkson TW, Greenwood MR. Organ mercury levels in infants with omphaloceles treated with organic mercurial antiseptic. Arch Dis Child. 1977 Dec;52(12):962-4." id="25">(25)</a>. In that year, a study was
carried out in which thimerosal was added topologically to the
stomach area of 13 children with infected umbilical cords, after
which 10 of them died. According to the autopsy report, the
deaths were due to the effects of internal organic Hg toxicity.
This study is a stark illustration of the reality that infants and
young children are much more susceptible to the toxic effects
of thimerosal than older children and adults. Nonetheless,
infants are exposed to significant levels of Hg through TCVs
even today, and an estimated 50% of the Hg many infants
receive comes from periodic bolus doses of thimerosal in
certain vaccines <a class="reference" href="#twentysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kern JK, Haley BE, Geier DA, Sykes LK, King PG, Geier MR.

				<h5>Emerging science from developing countries</h5>
				<p>
					In recent years, in addition to the aforementioned studies
from developed countries, studies have been undertaken
to quantify the risk of harm from the administration of
TCV to children in developing countries. For example,
investigators examined how exposure to Hg through TCVs
administered within the first six months of life affected the
neurodevelopment of Amazonian infants in one urban centre
and two rural villages <a class="reference" href="#thirtyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dorea JG, Marques RC, Isejima C. Neurodevelopment of Amazonian infants: antenatal and postnatal exposure to methyl- and ethylmercury. J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:132876. doi: 10.1155/2012/132876." id="38">(38)</a>. They found that such exposure
had a significant and increasingly negative impact on Gesell
development scores with increasing amounts of Hg exposure
from TCVs administered within the first six months of life.
Other investigators examined a cohort of infants in Poland
to evaluate the relationship between neonatal exposure to
the administration of TCVs and child development <a class="reference" href="#thirtynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mrozek-Budzyn D, Majewska R, Kieltyka A, Augustyniak M. Neonatal exposure to Thimerosal from vaccines and child development in the first 3 years of life. Neurotoxicol Teratol. 2012 Nov-Dec;34(6):592-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ntt.2012.10.001." id="39">(39)</a>. They
observed that the administration of TCVs had a significant
impact on psychomotor development between the 12th and
24th months of life, and that over the course of three years of
follow-up, the overall deficit in psychomotor development
attributable to neonatal exposure to TCVs was significantly
higher in the group exposed to TCVs.
				</p>
				<p>
					That the harm caused by thimerosal was comprehensively
documented just one year before the Minamata Convention
on Hg exempted TCVs from regulation globally is tragically
ironic. It would seem that the assurances offered by the HICs
to the LMICs regarding the safety of the use of thimerosal
in vaccines were misguided at best and deceptive at worst.
It is also ironic that those who led the diplomatic effort in
favour of retaining thimerosal in vaccines for the LMICs are
predominantly HICs (including the USA). Many of these HICs,
in fact, participate in the activities of, or are allied to, the
JUSSCANZ (a negotiating block, the members of which are
Japan, the USA, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Norway and
New Zealand) working group of the INC, and have already
reduced and/or removed thimerosal from all, or almost all, their
own paediatric vaccine formulations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having established that the safety of thimerosal is in dispute,
and that this dispute dates back to the 1930s, the argument
that thimerosal was removed from vaccines marketed in the
HICs merely as a precaution must be discounted. In summary,
if thimerosal is most likely associated with an avoidable, serious
and documented risk of harm, it is of paramount importance to
find out whether an effective, safer alternative exists.

				<h4>Is removing thimerosal from vaccines for LMICs impossible due to cold-chain and storage issues and the lack of any alternative to thimerosal for multi-dose vials?</h4>

					Can it be that since 1929, the development of a more effective,
less toxic preservative has eluded science? Moreover, if an
alternative does exist, why were the deliberations of the INC,
which wrote the text of the Minamata Convention on Hg,
dominated by arguments claiming that there is no injustice in
allowing the use of thimerosal in vaccines due to the lack of
any alternative. Instead, the proponents of thimerosal argue
that the real threat of injustice comes from the contemplation
of removing “this currently necessary and irreplaceable

claim made by the US delegation to the INC that the use of
2-PE is experimental and its recommendation that thimerosal
must continue to be used in the developing nations: “The
FDA has not identified any preservative as effective as
thimerosal preservative. Some have suggested the use of
2-phenoxyethanol as an alternative; however, this component
has not been widely used as a preservative in US-licensed

results of the study indicated that “2-PE provides a superior
antimicrobial effectiveness over thimerosal…because
thimerosal was not an effective preservative in reducing
bioburden…and protecting multi-dose formulations against unintentional contamination in the field during multi-dose
use of products that are kept at refrigerated temperatures,”
whereas 2-PE was stable, did not impact the stability of
the vaccine and had a much higher rate of antimicrobial
effectiveness in the vaccine formulations tested than those in
which thimerosal was used <a class="reference" href="#fortytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Khandke L, Yang C, Krylova K, Jansen KU, Rashidbaigi A.

					Thus, the study demonstrated that 2-PE is <em>an effective preservative,</em> while thimerosal is either <em>a marginally effective or an ineffective preservative</em>. In terms of both cold-chain storage and multi-dose vials, the study showed that 2-PE is the superior, not the inferior, preservative for the safe preservation and distribution of the vaccine, regardless of where the vaccine might be sent. It is more effective and much safer when used as a preservative in multi-dose vials than is thimerosal, because it is neither as human-tissue toxic, nor as bioaccumulatively toxic as its Hg-based predecessor <a class="reference" href="#fortythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Geier DA, Jordan SK, Geier MR.

					While the conclusion of the Pfizer study and other peerreviewed
scientific papers might have had an important
impact at the INC negotiations were they well established in
the minds of delegates, their import was lessened and even
disputed by official submissions like those of the USA, which
claimed that there was no alternative preservative comparable
to thimerosal, even though 2-PE has been used in mandated
vaccines given to American children for the past 70 years. In
the face of opposite evaluations of thimerosal’s effectiveness,
safety and irreplaceability, one offered by NGOs and the other
offered by public health authorities, INC delegates seemed
ultimately to defer to the public health authorities.

					Substituting thimerosal with 2-PE in vaccines for developing
countries will require careful planning. The proponents
of thimerosal specifically cite the regulatory process as
the greatest obstacle to substitution, arguing that it is so
cumbersome and costly that a ban on thimerosal will force the
countries to use only single-dose vials (8). In a crisis situation,
with an unsafe vaccine preservative being distributed to
immunise around 84 million children in 120 countries every
year, the regulatory process must be streamlined to permit the
use of 2-PE in multi-dose vials in the developing nations as well
as the developed nations, or to provide financial assistance to
make a single-dose supply of vaccine available <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="King K, Paterson M, Green SK.

to the cost of switching to 2-PE at the manufacturing level, it
has been estimated that the cost of a 0.5 mL dose of thimerosal
in US$ in a 0.01% thimerosal-preserved vaccine is about
$0.000441 and that of 2-PE in a 2.5% 2-PE-preserved vaccine is
about $0.00228 <a class="reference" href="#fortyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Coalition for Mercury-free Drugs (CoMeD), Inc.

be $0.001839 per dose. However, this increase in cost would be
offset by the reduced costs associated with handling, as well as
the 2+% reduction in the amount of aqueous solution needed
to be added to each vaccine vial. Thus, it may be concluded
that the reduction in hazard would offset the minor increase in

				<p>
					Most significantly, the cost of switching to a more effective and
safer preservative must be weighed against the cumulative
burden of avoidable harm being done to children by the
thimerosal in their vaccines. If the Committee on Government Reform of the US House of Representatives is correct in
associating TCVs with autism <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burton D. Mercury in Medicine Report. Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness, Committee on Government Reform, US House of Representatives. Congressional Record,, 2003 May 21, pp. E1011-E1030." id="15">(15)</a>, then the cost of maintaining
thimerosal in the vaccine supply, unacknowledged by public
health authorities, may be as high as $3.2 million per affected
child over the course of his/her lifetime <a class="reference" href="#fortyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ganz ML. The lifetime distribution of incremental societal costs of autism. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2007 Apr;161(4):343-9." id="45">(45)</a>. This is an even
more alarming figure when one considers the current rate of
autism in the US is 1 in 68, a statistic derived from the early
2000s when the routine US vaccine schedule for children under
2 years of age could contain as much as 275 μg micrograms
Hg from Thimerosal. Which developing nation would willingly
incur this risk associated with TCVs in the independent
scientific literature, when not only the intellectual, but also the
economic cost and scale of harm is so great?

					Along with NGOs, the United Methodist Women (UMW), a
global organisation of women who advocate for the health and
well-being of all, especially of women and children, described
the presence of thimerosal in vaccines not as a financial but an
ethical issue. In keeping with the historical global resolution
of the United Methodist Church, “Protecting children from
mercury-containing drugs,” passed in 2008, the Deputy
General Secretary of the UMW, Harriett Jane Olson, joined Rev
Lisa K Sykes, the President of CoMeD, in expressing concerns
about the ongoing use of TCVs to the INC. They stated: “In an
era when cost-effective, much less toxic, non-bioaccumulative
and more effective alternatives are available and in use as inprocess
sanitisers and preservatives, there is no conscionable
justification for the continuing presence of thimerosal in
human pharmaceuticals. We reject the notion offered by those
who defend mercury in medicine that vaccine safety is static,
and that, even though a safer global vaccine supply can be
achieved by the removal of mercury from the manufacturing
process, this inconvenience is somehow an undue burden
especially when compared to sparing many children around
the world from premature death or a lifetime of disability” <a class="reference" href="#fortysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Methodist Women.

Minamata Convention on Hg. Rather than the WHO and HICs, it
was only “(t)wo US (NGOs who) pushed for the convention to
phase out or phase down thimerosal, contending that it poses a risk to children’s health. Numerous global health agencies
led by the World Health Organization rallied to protect it,
however, arguing that the preservative is safe and essential to
vaccination programs that protect the world’s poorest children

been used for a long time as an effective preservative in some
vaccines, and a number of pharmaceutical and cosmetic
products… Thimerosal has been used for >60 years in infant
vaccines and other applications and has not been associated
with adverse health effects in the general population… Hence,
there is no reason to stop the use of thimerosal-containing
vaccines in the current immunization programs worldwide. The

positive” <a class="reference" href="#fortyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Francois G, Duclos P, Margolis H, Lavanch D, Siegrist CA, Meheus A, Lambert PH, Emiroglu N, Badur S, Van Damme P.

					Years before the Minamata Convention on Hg was held, amid growing concerns about the safety of TCVs in the USA, Dr John Clements of WHO offered an emotional and subjective defence of thimerosal at a meeting of vaccine manufacturers, US government officials and others in Norcross, Georgia in 2000. This foreshadowed the prejudicial defence of TCVs that would be made by WHO to the INC. In Georgia, responding to the preliminary findings of a study that demonstrated the harm done by TCVs, Dr Clements stated [emphasis added], "I am really concerned that we have taken off like a boat going down one arm of the mangrove swamp at high speed, when in fact there was not enough discussion really early on about which way the boat should go at all. <em>And I really do want to risk offending everyone in the room by saying that perhaps this study should not have been done at all, because the outcome of it could have to some extent, been predicted</em>, and we have all reached this point now where we are left hanging ... there is now the point at which the research results have to be handled, and even if this committee decides that there is no association (between TCVs and adverse events resulting from their administration) and that information gets out, the work that has been done and through the freedom of information that will be taken by others and will be used in ways beyond the control of this group. And I am very concerned about that as I suspect it is already too late to do anything regardless of any professional body and what they say. <em>My mandate as I sit here in the group is to make sure at the end of the day that 100,000,000 are immunized with DTP, Hepatitis B and if possible Hib, this year, next year and for many years to come, and that will have to be with thimerosal-containing vaccines..."</em> <a class="reference" href="#fortynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Simpsonwood Retreat Center.

					On May 21, 2002, at a time when the thimerosal content in
US vaccines was being phased out, a “WHO informal meeting
on removal of thiomersal from vaccines and its implications
for global vaccine supply” was held at the WHO headquarters
in Geneva, Switzerland. A document released at that meeting
stated [emphasis added]: “As part of a number of other
activities, WHO organized a meeting with manufacturers that
supply vaccines to the United Nations agencies in order to
achieve a better understanding of the different approaches
taken by manufacturers, to discuss the implications of the
current WHO policy on keeping thiomersal in multi-dose vial
presentations and to consider the implications of different
actions for manufacturers.

Disturbingly, the document said, “WHO is concerned about
the current situation whereby manufacturers in developed
countries have been forced to lower thiomersal content of
their vaccines...” Finally, the notes in this document indicated
the following WHO strategies [emphasis added]: “On analysis

					The obdurate support of WHO for the continuing use of TCVs and for TCV manufacturers was also apparent in "Manufacturer perspectives on alternatives to thiomersal," a WHO informal consultation which was aimed at developing further guidance on vaccines for the UNEP-convened INC4, and which had input from Sanofi Pasteur, Novartis and Crucell <a class="reference" href="#fiftyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.

The presentation suggested that thimerosal is safe and is not associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, on the basis of epidemiological population studies, even though clinical and not epidemiological studies are required to prove the safety of a drug. In the presentation, the manufacturers suggested that "a suitable alternative (to thimerosal) may never be found," failing to recognise that one alternative, 2-PE, has become the acceptable, safer choice of the HICs. Having questioned even the possibility of switching to a safer, much less toxic preservative for the LMICs, the vaccine manufacturers then stated: "We recommend a long-term WHO policy on thiomersal use which defines a realistic timing for future request of switching." With a recurring focus on the "need to recover investments" should thimerosal be eliminated from vaccines (for LMICs), the manufacturers suggested that the development window for these formulations may be at least 7- 10 years away for LMICs <a class="reference" href="#fiftyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization.

					Was a false dichotomy created by those who presented the
issue in terms of a choice between TCVs or no vaccine at all,
in the context of the developing countries, at the Minamata
Convention on Hg? Was this dichotomy created through
the exercise of undue influence by those most liable for the
distribution of TCVs and the harm caused by them, upon those
most susceptible to this exposure, with the help of incomplete
and sometimes misleading information at global diplomatic negotiations? While vaccine manufacturers such as Merck
affirmed that, “The role of the pharmaceutical industry in
respecting and promoting health as a human right is complex.
We believe that our most basic role is our core activity of
discovering, developing and delivering medicines and vaccines
to address unmet medical needs…We also recognize our
ethical duty to support governments in their efforts to protect
the right to health by ‘doing no harm’” <a class="reference" href="#fiftytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Merck.com. Health as a human right.

without any incentive to make Hg-free the standard for vaccine
formualtions, seems either unable or unwilling to recognize the
public health crisis posed by Thimerosal in vaccines.
				</p>
				<p>
					The extraordinary effort of WHO representatives to maintain
thimerosal in the global vaccine supply, particularly for
distribution to LMICs, would also seem to be in contradiction
to the description of Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General,
WHO, of the role of WHO: “(T)he world needs a global health
guardian, a custodian of values, a protector and defender
of health, including the right to health.” In fact, in 2000, the
UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
adopted a General Comment on the Right to Health which
defined its four essential elements as availability, accessibility,
acceptability and quality. With respect to the Right to Health,
WHO describes how it “has been actively strengthening
its role in providing … political leadership on the right to
health, including advocating for health-related human rights,
including the right to health” <a class="reference" href="#fiftythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. The right to health.

				</p>
				<p>
					The record of WHO on the issue of TCVs would seem to violate
this right to health completely. As defined in the context of the
right to health, quality means that “health facilities, goods and
services must be scientifically and medically appropriate and
of good quality.” The responsibility upon State Parties abiding
by the right to health includes the obligation “not to interfere
with the enjoyment of the right to health (‘do no harm’).” How
can WHO violate one of the elements of the right to health
to which it requires State Parties to conform? Is thimerosal
being maintained in the global vaccine supply because it is
impossible to make the world’s vaccine supply Hg-free, or
because it is in the interests of TCV distributors not to let the
benefits (lack of harm) of a global Hg-free vaccine supply
become apparent? Given the independent published scientific
literature (whether clinical, historical or epidemiological), all
of which demonstrates that TCVs are associated with serious
adverse events in some children, why would WHO, guild
organisations (such as the AAP) and HICs (such as the USA)
stubbornly defend the continuation of a known neurotoxin in
the global vaccine supply?

				<h4>Are vaccines, or the children to whom the vaccines are administered, being protected?</h4>
				<p>
					The global use of vaccines to eradicate diseases reflects the
power and legitimacy of public health institutions and public
health policies at every level of government. Vaccines are one
of the single greatest advancements in medicine <a class="reference" href="#fiftyfour" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Geier MR, Geier DA. The state of polio vaccination in the world: the case for continuing routine vaccination.

However, their acceptance of the authority that mandates them depend on
the guarantee of their safety and efficacy. If millions of children
are harmed by the use of an untested and toxic preservative in
mandated vaccines, not only is the legitimacy of the vaccine
programme called into question, but also the legitimacy of
those who run the programme, and the vaccines themselves.</p>
				<p>
					The discomfort created by the two conflicting ideas that (i)
Hg is highly toxic even at low levels and may have significant
adverse neurodevelopmental consequences in animal and
human systems, and (ii) all mandated vaccines, including those
containing Hg, are safe and effective, may be seen in terms of
cognitive dissonance. According to the theory of cognitive
dissonance, an individual faced with discomfort caused by the
dissonance between two conflicting ideas will seek to reduce
it. One way of doing this, described “in simple terms, can be the
filtering of information that conflicts with what you already
believe, in an effort to ignore that information and reinforce
your beliefs” <a class="reference" href="#fiftysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Science Daily. Cognitive dissonance [Internet]. Updated 2014 Feb 22 [cited 2014 Feb23]. Available from: http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/cognitive_dissonance.htm" id="56">(56)</a>. Applying the theory of cognitive dissonance
to the thimerosal controversy, the mantra that all vaccines are
safe and effective may cause public health officials, institutions
and researchers to contend that thimerosal is safe, despite
the great amount of evidence to the contrary; the belief in
the safety of vaccines is so non-negotiable in the estimation
of WHO and other public health authorities that credible
challenges to it, as in the case of the toxicity of thimerosal,
must be dismissed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the theory of cognitive dissonance to describe
institutional corruption, Cosgrove and Whitaker reported:
“Financial conflicts, whether arising from payments by a third
party (such as a pharmaceutical company), or from guild
interests, can lead researchers to engage in distorted science…
and to develop imbalanced conclusions about the risk/benefit
ratio of a class of medications...” <a class="reference" href="#fiftyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cosgrove L, Whitaker R.

obscured the danger of another toxin, lead, the use of which
was once deemed safe and beneficial in many marketed
products (gasoline, paint and pipes). According to Bridbord
and Hanson, the lead “industry was to use their public relations
capabilities to advertise the benefits of their products to the
general public while casting doubt on the possibility of harm
associated with use of these products.… The lead industry was
able to achieve its influence in large part by being the primary
supporter of research on health effects of lead and relying
upon the scientists that it supported to communicate and
interpret this research to the government and the public” <a class="reference" href="#fiftyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bridbord K, Hanson D.

Is this troubling paradigm of protecting the toxin rather than
the public, and especially the children exposed to it, repeating
itself? Furthermore, are vaccines immune to such corruption
because they are life-saving medicines, or ironically are they
uniquely susceptible to it, because a landmark reform in their
manufacture might suggest a previous and significant lack of
safety in a product mandated for administration because it is
declared to be safe, effective and life-saving?

dissonance can corrupt and weaken a system, described

intended for LMICs could be “the consequence of an influence
within an economy of influence that illegitimately weakens
the effectiveness of an institution, especially by weakening
the public trust of the institution.” Could the AAP’s abrupt
reversal in position on the safety of thimerosal, its fear of

				<h4>How will developing nations, left unprotected by the Minamata Convention on Hg, protect themselves from thimerosal?</h4>
				<p>
					Challenging WHO’s defence of the use of TCVs in the
developing nations, Cristina Girardi, a Deputy Minister in
the Chilean Congress, declared while addressing INC4,
“It is categorically unacceptable that the presence of this
compound is recommended mostly for developing nations,
which makes us question the seriousness of our international
health authorities and their respect for the human rights of
those who were born in the poorer geographical areas of the
world” <a class="reference" href="#fiftynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Environment Programme, Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for the Global Legally Binding Instrument on Mercury.

independently of the flawed diplomatic instrument emerging
as the Minamata Convention on Hg and of the influences that
produced it. They must press for national bans on TCVs to
protect themselves and their citizens. The injustice of the twotier
system of vaccine safety sanctioned by the Convention
should spur the developing nations to gain autonomy and
expertise in the assessment and surveillance of public health
policy and instruments. The evaluations made can then prompt
legislation which would ensure sound acceptable standards in
the areas of imported health products and practices. Above all
else, these standards, products and practices should be in the
best interest of the nation and free from discrimination.
				</p>
				<p>
					A mere three months after the adoption of the Minamata Convention on Hg, Chile became the first developing nation to pass legislation aimed at banning thimerosal in vaccines <a class="reference" href="#sixty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Corporacion Bioautismo. Thimerosal banned in Chilean vaccines [Internet]. Santiago, Chile: Bioautismo; 2014 Jan 24 [cited 2014 Feb 21]. Available from: http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/140124_Bioautismo_Statement_Thimerosal_Banned_in%20Chilean_vaccines_b.pdf" id="60">(60)</a>. By doing so, this nation has sought to afford itself the protection from TCVs which the Convention denied it. Parents who knew that their children had been injured by TCVs, together with supportive elected government officials, led a successful campaign which, on January 15, 2014, resulted in the passage of national legislation that eliminated anything more than a trace level of thimerosal in vaccines. This was achieved in the face of opposition from global public health organisations, including the Pan American Health Organization. The law, now awaiting the signature of Chile's president, has the following provision: "Thimerosal will be banned from all vaccines for the most vulnerable segments of the population (children 0-8 years of age, pregnant women, and adults over 60 years of age)" <a class="reference" href="#sixty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Corporacion Bioautismo. Thimerosal banned in Chilean vaccines [Internet]. Santiago, Chile: Bioautismo; 2014 Jan 24 [cited 2014 Feb 21]. Available from: http://mercury-freedrugs.org/docs/140124_Bioautismo_Statement_Thimerosal_Banned_in%20Chilean_vaccines_b.pdf" id="60">(60)</a>. If signed by the president, the law will take effect six months later. Clearly, the passage of this law, whether or not it is ultimately signed by the president, demonstrates that the people of Chile are challenging the exemption of TCVs by the Minamata Convention on Hg and the legitimacy of WHO.
				</p>
				<p>
					The assertions that thimerosal is safe, even for pregnant women and developing children in LMICs, by public health institutions and powerful government agencies in HICs responsible for shaping global vaccine policy seem to be characterised by a desire to reduce cognitive dissonance. Now, developing nations which wish to protect their children from the avoidable risk posed by thimerosal must follow Chile's example, challenging the influence and assurances of WHO and the legitimacy of the Minamata Convention on Hg. The current situation, in which TCVs are disproportionately distributed to developing nations, is unethical and must be remedied by the introduction of a single global standard of vaccine safety (no-thimerosal/reduced-thimerosal) for all persons, if the legacy of this diplomatic instrument and of the vaccine programme led by WHO is to be remembered as one of achievement rather than discrimination.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					On October 10, 2013, in Kumamoto, Japan, the nations represented in the INC of the UNEP adopted the Minamata Convention on Hg. While their efforts to eliminate and reduce some forms of exposure to Hg are laudable, the specific exemption of the Hg-based compound thimerosal, used as a preservative in certain vaccines, from regulation has given rise to the discriminatory practice of providing TCVs to LMICs, and no-thimerosal and reduced-thimerosal vaccines to HICs. While thimerosal is a poison that affects all systems in the body, it affects some physiological systems more than others and accumulates in some target organs more than others. Similarly, due to the Minamata Convention on Hg and the exemption of TCVs from regulation, and thus, their inequitable but sanctioned distribution, thimerosal is also adversely affecting some parts of the world more than others and accumulating in some targeted nations much more than others. This historic failure of diplomatic policy is in direct conflict with the right to health, as affirmed by the UN and WHO. The continuing distribution of TCVs to the LMICs was defended during the negotiations by the HICs, which have removed thimerosal from their own vaccine supplies, by guild organisations such as the AAP, the membership of which is responsible for administering TCVs, and by WHO, which continues to provide TCVs to the LMICs. The rationale for continuing the distribution of TCVs to the LMICs was that thimerosal is essential, safe and effective &ndash; claims that have been shown to be untrue. Public health policy leaders must consider whether the denial of the risk posed by TCVs is the consequence of a systemic response to the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance, resulting in the unassailable conclusion that all vaccines, even TCVs, are safe and effective despite the absence of evidence to support this conclusion. What is at stake is public confidence in the global vaccination programme and the well-being of children. Much safer, economic and less toxic alternatives, such as 2-PE, can replace thimerosal in preserved multi-dose vaccines intended for the LMICs. The global vaccine supply must be made Hg-free, and there should be a unified and high standard of safety for all persons, regardless of the wealth possessed by their country of origin. In a hundred years, others will evaluate whether the good accomplished by the Minamata Convention on Hg outweighed the injustice that it perpetrated by exempting TCVs from regulation, resulting in their disproportionate distribution to the most vulnerable among us &ndash; developing children in developing nations.
