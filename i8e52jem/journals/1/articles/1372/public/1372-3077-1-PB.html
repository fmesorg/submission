					Ninety per cent of  people with HIV in India have no access to modern pharmaceuticals, which can  cost more than $10,000 per year. A combination of denial, helplessness and  complacence dominates the issue of access to treatment for people living with  HIV/AIDS in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until recently, US drug trade policy was almost totally captive to the  pharmaceutical industry which cares little about marketing drugs in developing  countries such as India. They &mdash; and their proxies in India &mdash; ensured that  generic versions of these medicines were not produced in India as that might  weaken its intellectual-property protection in the US or other lucrative  markets. Many Indian pharmaceutical companies do have the technical capacity to  manufacture these drugs, which could sell for a tenth or less their current  prices if it were not for patent restrictions. While not a complete solution to  the problem of access to essential HIV medicines, this is certainly an area  worth exploring.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many developing countries are seriously exploring the possibility of dealing  with policies related to drug sales and intellectual property rights within the  legal framework of the World Trade Organisation. South Africa has taken a lead  on this issue. These countries are at the receiving end of a trade war  unleashed by United States trade representatives. Today, after a series of  high-profile protests organised by AIDS activists, US trade representatives  have moderated their aggressiveness against South Africa's efforts to expand  access to HIV medicine to its citizens.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, this change applies only to South Africa. Indian AIDS NGOs, community  groups and policy makers have yet to take steps to facilitate local production  of essential HIV medication in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Global Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) treaty has now existed for  about 50 years. However, the creation of World Trade Organisation (WTO), an  outcome of 'Uruguay Rounds' of global trade negotiations, demanded that all  countries impose US/European style patents on pharmaceuticals. The result is  that pharmaceutical executives no longer look the other way if anyone,  anywhere, manufactures modern drugs without the permission of the patent  holder. Industry pressures the US government to use its great power to force  unworkable arrangements on poor countries, which cannot possibly afford  US-priced medicine, making health solutions impossible and assuring millions of  deaths.
				</p>
				<p>
					But the WTO treaty does include some safeguards like "compulsory licensing"  (which recognises the right of a sovereign government to license use of a  patent within its borders, in certain situations such as a public health  emergency or national security) or "parallel importing" (which allows the  governments to shop around for cheaper medications). In the context of the HIV  crisis in India the commerce ministry should explore the possibility of using  'compulsory licensing' of essential HIV medications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, at the opening of the 5th International conference of AIDS in Asia  Pacific, the Malaysian prime minister openly called for greater political  commitment from Asian leaders to address the issue of 'compulsory licensing of  essential HIV medications in developing countries to expand access to treatment  for people living with HIV/AIDS'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most protest on this issue has not been against the WTO, but against US policy,  which has gone well beyond the WTO treaty in supporting the pharmaceutical  industry's claim that its intellectual property interests come before anyone's  heath needs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another disturbing trend is the increasing influence of international  pharmaceutical industry over international AIDS service organisations based in  developed countries. The sponsorship they offer these organisations is part of  their overall public relations efforts Staff and leaders of these organisations  have no qualms about taking this 'blood money' as they and their loved ones get  the best treatment &mdash; paid by their own governments or as 'compassionate' (a  compassion restricted only for residents of developed countries!) effort from  pharmaceutical companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					I propose the following actions for the consideration of the Indian AIDS NGOs,  PWA groups and policy makers:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						UNAIDS and NACO should set up a       working group to address the issue of access to essential HIV medications       in India.
					</li>
					<li>
						NACO should form a technical       resource group to look at the issue of access to HIV medication for people       living with HIV
					</li>
					<li>
						India should update the WHO's       essential HIV medication list and make this list available to health care       providers
					</li>
					<li>
						India should short list       non-patented medications from the WHO essential HIV medications list for       tax rebates
					</li>
					<li>
						The ministry of commerce should       call for compulsory licensing of essential HIV medications in India
					</li>
					<li>
						The government of India should       work with SAARC countries to develop a parallel importing strategy on       essential HIV medications
					</li>
					<li>
						Indian AIDS activists and NGOs       should develop an understanding of the issue of distribution patterns of       essential HIV medications, and evaluate the efficacy of international AIDS       agencies working India based on their commitment to the issue of access to       essential HIV medications
					</li>
					<li>
						India should declare the HIV/AIDS crisis as public health emergency.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Those interested in following up these issues or in further technical  briefing on issues related to how trade policies are affecting the cost of  essential HIV medicines in developing countries, and details of the stratagems  and spoils of the global pharmaceutical industry, can contact me.
