				<h4>Not irrelevant  research</h4>
				<p>
					The letter from Bangalore by Dr. Sanjay Pai <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pai Sanjay. Letter from Bangalore. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 165." id="3">(1)</a> regarding research that 'cannot and should not be repeated' raised an important  and interesting point. I do agree that any research which has no benefits for  the people on which it is done should not be done. Moreover, in a broader sense,  it may be unethical to waste scarce resources on such matters. However, in his  letter, Dr Pai clubbed a study of the ICMR in the same category of research, ie  research which should not be done. This study was to measure the average length  of penis in Indian males. Dr Pai has solicited comments on his view. I disagree  with the author's views on this matter. I have not read the protocol of this  study. However, as a psychiatrist, I do feel that such a study is not  irrelevant. Such studies have been carried out in the past, and researchers have  disagreed on the results! <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Virginia Sadock.

					There are many myths in the general population  about the size of the penis, and these myths in turn contribute to sexual  dysfunction. This research will help to dispel this myth. Moreover, it may help  manufacturers of condoms to make their product of the right size. I need not  mention the disastrous consequences, to the nation, of an ill-fitting  condom.
