				<h4>Subscription number 001</h4>
				<p>
					I was surprised to receive a copy for which I was given a subscription number 001 for the state of Bihar. I had seen a specimen copy of the journal in our college library and found it very interesting and worth subscribing to.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it is the subscription number which has made me think and write about the lack of medical ethics awareness (although many doctors may be subscribing to other medical ethics journals and also reading them). People in this state are among the most deprived in India. It is a state where private practice is allowed and this has led to the worst conditions in health institutions. In our hospital, patients who are admitted think it a boon if they escape death. The worst medicine is practised in this institute. We doctors have no sense of responsibility towards patients and in turn patients and their attendants have no faith in government doctors here. Prescriptions are irrational, patient input is very low and output even low for emergency admissions.
