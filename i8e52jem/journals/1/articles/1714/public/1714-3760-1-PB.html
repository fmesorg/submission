				<h4>Medical practice in Delhi <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mahendru Saurabh: The Big Apple a day, keeps doctors away. The Times of India 22 June 1997 p18." id="1">(1)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Ten to twenty per  cent of Delhi's fresh medical graduates leave the country without even  attempting to obtain further qualifications here. Others trickle out after  having completed their post-graduation. Even medics who scale great heights  continue to say their prayers looking westward. Some even change their field of  work to reach El Dorado.
				</p>
				<p>
					This migrant is rampant not because access to the US is easy for  the medico. Far from it. Even for the lucky few who have got their passports  stamped and the air tickets in their pockets, the ordeal is far from over for  there are the hospital interviews. And then, one is never sure of getting a  residency of choice or even getting one at all. The fields offered are  predominantly non-surgical and in the black-dominated areas where the white  person fears to tread.
				</p>
				<p>
					The odds are, indeed, heavy. And yet, the mass exodus continues.  The reasons become clear when one takes a look at the scenario back home. For a  young doctor trying to get established, the struggle is hard in India. Here, a  young doctor has two broad options: he can either join a public sector organisation  such as a teaching hospital or establish lucrative private practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors who join public sector institutions do have an aura. One  can aim at setting up an ethical practice and at least hope for some research  facilities. But often the journey is arduous, against a strong hierarchy where  yesmanship, not merit, is the key. Recently, the head of surgery of a  prestigious government hospital passed away. His juniors swore by his surgical  expertise and dedication. When he died his bank balance was a mere Rs. 3,000.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even the working environs are far from conducive. For resident  doctors, basic facilities like drinking water and clean toilets are scarce.  Recently, the water supply of a major hospital in the heart of Delhi was found  to be polluted with sewage, leading to an epidemic of jaundice among the  doctors working there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Naturally, the majority want to do private practice. Competition  in the private sector is fierce, which does not always allow ethical practice.  Cuts and commissions are quite common and it is important to be a member of a  doctors' clique.

				<h4>Transmission of hepatitis B <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jain Kalpana: Recycled syringes are taking lives. The Times of India 22 June 1997 p19." id="2">(2)</a></h4>
				<p>
					A large number of  people at Sirsa in Haryana were found to be infected by hepatitis B.  Investigations showed two quacks practising in this area, using a single  syringe each for all their patients without boiling them or changing their  needles.
				</p>
				<p>
					There could be any number of such areas where deadly diseases,  easily acquired through infected needles and blood, are spreading in the  absence of stringent mechanisms to prevent the reuse of unsterile syringes and  needles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even qualified doctors are not sure of the quality of needles  and syringes being used by them. Former president of the Delhi Medical  Association, Dr. Vinay Aggarwal, says: "It is very difficult to know whether  the syringes being used by us are recycled or genuine." Disposable syringes and  needles, which should be destroyed after the first use, are in wide  circulation.
				</p>
				<p>
					A study conducted in Calcutta by the All India Institute of  Public Health found that 56% of the disposable syringes and needles being sold  were contaminated! The samples used in this study were obtained from the  supplies departments of major Calcutta hospitals and private nursing homes. The  samples had come from eleven leading manufacturers. Eight of the forty-eight  samples did not have the date of manufacture or expiry stamped on the packages.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although rules exist for the destruction of syringes and needles  after their initial use, there seems to be no system for preventing expired and  infected needles from being sold again.

				<h4>Recycling AIDS among patients and rag-pickers <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mishra Manjari: Racket in recycled syringes, needles exposes rag-pickers in UP to AIDS. The Times of India 12 July 1997 p9." id="3">(3)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Shahid and  Habibulla - brother and sister aged eight and ten years - are proud of the fact  that they earn much more from scavenging than their mother. Every morning at 4  a. m. they join several others at the King George Medical College (KGMC) in  Lucknow. Each of them goes through garbage dumps outside the emergency and  private wards and fishes out disposable needles and syringes, not yet  destroyed, which have ended up in the garbage bin. A day's collection fetches  them thirty to forty rupees from a agent in Daliganj.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shahid's hands are pricked all over. He dismisses this casually.  He has never heard of AIDS, hepatitis or any other health hazards. He knows  nothing about what happens to the stuff they deliver. There are scores of  children participating in this predawn activity near all the major hospitals in  Lucknow. 'It is common knowledge,' says Dr. N. C. Mishra, former head  of the department of surgery at KGMC. 'The reports are very disturbing,  indeed,' said Dr. Asha Mathur of the department of pathology, KGMC.  'It is not only syringes. Even catheters and plastic urine bags are being  recycled in Lucknow. This could result in a disaster.' Dr. Sanjeev Kumar  of the department of surgery, KGMC, calls it an organised racket every doctor  in the city knows about. Yet nothing is being done about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another senior professor who insisted on anonymity, was more  forthright. 'Why only urchins? Even the wardboys and sweepers in the  hospital recycle the used syringes and needles by selling them off at the drug  stores outside the KGMC gate.' Dr. Malini Gupta (not her real name)  admitted that her <em>kabari</em> gives triple the amount for the  non-damaged syringes than that for damaged syringes.

				<h4>Dubious pathology laboratory <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rohera Draupadi: Government proposes regulations as dubious pathology labs flourish in city. Bombay Times, The Times of India 17 June 1997 p1." id="4">(4)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Bharat Shah,  consulting nephrologist, P.D. Hinduja Hospital, says: "I can never be  comfortable relying on test reports done at labs outside my hospital because  most path labs in the city (nearly 70 to 80%) do not have proper equipment,  technology or personnel. Also the medium that is used and the conditions under  which the tests are carried out are never right..."
				</p>
				<p>
					Mahendra Ojha, hospital planning and health consultant, concurs.  "In the absence of any regulation and licensing by the authorities, hundreds of  labs are mushrooming in the city, (Mumbai has over 1,500 labs) without even  meeting the basic standards. But we do not seem to realise the gravity of the  situation..."
				</p>
				<p>
					Path labs, Ojha reveals, have become major money making rackets  with businessmen now entering the line. Since no doctor can function today  without a pathologist's report, this branch of health care has become a high  revenue generating field. "The profit margins range from 100% to 300% on any  given test."
				</p>
				<p>
					Food and Drugs Administration Commissioner Anil Lakhina admits  that in the absence of any legislation, the quality of investigations just  falls by the wayside.

				<p>
					A study in Chennai  shows that the national drug policy relating to malaria is hardly being  followed by many medical practitioners.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the more than 1,000 questionnaires sent to doctors in  government service and private practice, only a handful were returned for  analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					As many as 20.6% of doctors studied did not know that primaquine  could not be administered to pregnant women. Five per cent of doctors came up  with the shocking opinion that blood could be donated by patients with malaria.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nine percent of doctors thought that malaria was rare.

				<p>
					The decision by  Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, to treat a staff doctor suffering from AIDS has  driven a wedge in the hospital staff. Whilst one section calls it an  unnecessary risk, the other says that it's the least they could do for an  ailing colleague.
				</p>
				<p>
					Colleagues suspect he must have acquired the infection from one  of the many patients he attended to during his ten-year-long service in the  hospital.
				</p>
				<p>
					A surgeon with the Head and Neck Department, the doctor is now  languishing in near-isolation in the septic room of the Intensive Care Unit.  Not many doctors, paramedics and conservancy staffers are willing to go  anywhere near this room.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors requesting anonymity pointed out that even if bare  traces of HIV virus are diagnosed in a patient, he/she is immediately  transferred to the designated government hospitals. They ask: "If this doctor  can be treated here, why are others shunted out?"

				<p>
					In a recent bizarre  case, the employee of a nationalised bank was barred from entering its premises  when he was found to have tested positive for HIV. When he insisted to  attending to his duties, the bank referred the case to the district collector,  who, in turn, entrusted the case to the police who went on to issue an arrest  warrant. It is only after officials of the AIDS control project intervened on  his behalf that he was able to continue work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Especially ironic is the outcome in a project aimed at setting  up a rehabilitation centre for HIV-positive patients on the premises of a  leprosy hospital at Kukutpally. This was vehemently opposed by the inmates,  themselves suffering from leprosy.

				<p>
					Chochi, better known as 'AIDS village' under Jhajhar tehsil in  Rohtak district of Haryana, where Ranbir Singh died of the virus, is facing  serious social alienation and humiliation. It is not just the future of  Ranbir's three daughters that is in jeopardy but that of the entire population  of 4,500.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surrounding villages have isolated Chochi in fear of an  epidemic. It is almost impossible for the villagers to escape from the stigma  of living in an AIDS village.
				</p>
				<p>
					A move is afoot to set up a high-level committee of experts  from the Indian Council of Medical Research to investigate the unethical  behaviour on the part of doctors in the hospital and disclosure of the blood  status in utter disregard of the direction of anonymity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. D. R. Gaur, head of the Department of Community Medicine,  bemoaned the fact that no proper guidelines or training have been provided to  face a situation such as that in Chochi. 'We have only clinical  information which, too, is confusing when we have to deal with people. The  social aspect is missing in the entire campaign and I am confused about how to  reach out to the people.'

				<p>
					A study of seven  industries in Mumbai by researchers from Yale University and the local AIDS  control centre reveals widespread suspicion that AIDS can affect the company's  business or production. There is also a feeling that the presence of  individuals testing positive for HIV mean bad publicity for the company. This  has led to the emergence of a ruthless streak where, on the one hand, some companies  openly test prospective and current employees for evidence of infection by HIV  and, on the other hand, other companies secretly obtain information on the  HIV status of their employees through blood donation drives. Infected employees  are either fired, asked to retire early or moved to a location within the  factory where there is hardly any contact with co-workers.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is estimated that 0.5 - 2% of all factory employees are HIV-positive. Inevitably, the industries in the city will soon be feeling the  impact of the epidemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					No company has a formal, written policy on HIV/AIDS in the  workplace. Prevention activities, if conducted at all, are one-time  occurrences that have little impact on the employees.

				<h4>Doctors drive AIDS patients to quacks <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chinai Rupa: Doctors drive AIDS patients to quacks. The Times of India 14 August 1997 p1." id="10">(10)</a></h4>
				<p>
					The failure of the  medical profession to attend to patients with AIDS or offer sympathy and  understanding has driven them and their relatives to quacks, with disastrous  results. Not only have the patients worsened and died but the attempt at  obtaining a cure results in the loss of savings made over a life time. Worse,  quacks convince patients that they can marry and have children, passing on the  virus to the hapless spouse and children.
				</p>
				<p>
					Left with nothing but shattered hopes and weakened health,  hounded by discrimination, Indian patients with AIDS are losing the will  to live and are dying faster than in other countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					The few doctors who are working for these patients fight a  losing battle and risk being burnt out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Maharashtra's deputy health secretary, Arun Ghate, offered a  typically bureaucratic solution. He asks patients and relatives to complain  against doctors in public hospitals who deny treatment, cheerfully disregarding  the fact that those already known to be flouting rules continue to flourish on  account of their political connections. He also pleads powerlessness on the  part of the government against erring private practitioners:
				</p>
				<p>
					The response of an unnamed general practitioner embodies some of  the common arguments offered by doctors: 'I will not treat AIDS patients  for three reasons - their presence brings down the image of my practice; I have  no time for patients who need long-drawn treatment; and there is little point  in taking on such patients when I cannot offer them a cure.'

				<p>
					This report focuses  on the dilemma of a man who has been married a month but has not yet informed  his wife that he had tested positive for HIV seven years ago. He defends  himself by saying that he protects his semi-illiterate wife by practising safe  sex, under the rationale that he does not wish to have a baby just yet.  'It is terrible when my wife pleads with me not to wear a condom since she  wants a baby,' he says. Instead of telling her the truth, he had told her  and her family that he suffers from cancer before they got married. In an  earlier, three-year relationship too he had told his girl friend that he had  cancer. It was only when she insisted on marriage that he revealed the truth.  Ugly scenes followed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Like many others with HIV, he blames his parents for insisting  that he marry. He has decided to commit suicide when he develops full-blown  AIDS. 'I do not want my illness to be exposed.' He fears that his  wife will be ostracised after his death.

					Several samples of  popular ayurvedic 'tonic' preparations, when tested, were found to contain high  levels of lead, warns the Consumer Education and Research Society (CERS) in its  journal <em>Consumer Currents</em>.  The preparations tested were Suvarna Vasant Malati Bruhat, Suvarna Malini  Vasant, Suvarna Vasant Malati Rasa and Suvarna Vasant Malati. These are  recommended for the treatment of weakness and debility. If one pill of some of  these preparations is taken twice a day, the weekly intake of lead can be 63.2  to 74.6 mg, The lead content absorbed from these preparations is 14 to 28 times  higher than the weekly permissible limits recommended by WHO.

				</p>
				<p>
					The cell was set up amidst great enthusiasm by former minister  of health, Salim Sherwani in March, this year. Soon thereafter, it started  receiving complaints from all over the country - a total of 76 complaints in  four months. The largest number have been from Delhi, followed by Uttar  Pradesh. These range from complaints on negligence by doctors to those on  thefts in medical stores and nonavailability of drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cell had promised strict action against doctors found  guilty.
				</p>
				<p>
					None of the sixteen states from where complaints have been  received have responded to the health ministry's move.

				<p>
					Sitting in a  makeshift office in a flat in Ghaziabad's Pratap Vihar, R. S. Thakur, Director  (Administration) of Santosh World Medical Academy, told this reporter, when he  posed as a poor student wishing to join the medical college: 'We charge  Rs. 25,00,000 for an MBBS seat in the NRI quota. (The) maximum we can come down  (is) by a lakh.'
				</p>
				<p>
					This World Academy is run by Dr. P. Mahalingam, the personal  physician of Bahujan Samaj Party chief Kanshi Ram and functions out of five  houses on the outskirts of Ghaziabad. It survives through chronic violation of  all rules.
				</p>
				<p>
					The makeshift lecture theatres have leaky roofs, living rooms  have been converted into classrooms whilst one of these houses serves as a  mortuary. Each student pays Rs. 10,000 as library fee but the physiology,  pathology, biochemistry shelves are barren. Anatomy has a few books, all donated.  There is no campus boundary which demarcates this cluster of buildings from  surrounding fields and private houses.
				</p>
				<p>
					The college is affiliated to Meerut University and offers  courses towards MBBS, BDS and degrees in physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  Though the authorities say that the college is well staffed, second year  students say their preclinical classes have not yet begun due to shortage of  teachers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite an adverse report from the Medical Council of India, the  college started functioning in January 1995 after the State Health Ministry  gave its sanction.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several students said that receipts were hardly ever provided  and when they were, the amount said to have been received was much less than  that paid and it was scribbled in pencil on a scrap of paper.

				<p>
					The lure of filthy  lucre seems to be eroding the medical ethical codes as well. In Maharashtra,  the state medical council is grappling with several cases of self-glorification  by doctors who are 'marketing' themselves through advertisements in newspapers  with claims of successful 'rare' operations, fancy fitness and weight-loss  programmes or 'guaranteed' cures for cancer and other dreaded diseases. Far  from confining themselves to their consulting rooms and allowing their good  work to speak for them, doctors are increasingly taking to brash marketing  methods or dubious consultancy columns and TV talk shows to promote themselves  and their 'business'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Maharashtra Medical Council recently cancelled the  registration of a celebrity doctor who modelled for a well-known Ayurvedic  tonic after he refused to apologise for such crass commercialism. Similar  action has been threatened against another who appeared in a commercial for a  toothpaste. The council is also proceeding against a doctor who has placed  advertisements in newspapers for her slimming programmes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Self-promotion in any form is a punishable offence under the  apex Medical Council of India's rules and the state council's code of  ethics which even bars doctors from publishing their photographs. But so  rampant is the practice now that a physician even published a calendar with his  name, address, degrees and pager number.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is obvious that only strict vigil and action by medical  councils can put an end to such pernicious practices. But then, going by the  wall graffiti, huge hoardings and newspaper advertisements some of physicians  in north India put up to proclaim their expertise, the Medical Council of India  does not seem bothered by such violations of its codes and rules.
