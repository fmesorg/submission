				<p>
					A look at our financial  status might suggest that the Forum for Medical Ethics Society is doing well.  Our income from subscriptions more than met the main activity of the trust,  printing and posting of the journal. And we were able to set aside a contingency  fund of Rs 40,000 to meet unexpected costs in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the majority of  the income from subscriptionss came from a collaborative venture with Cehat to  promote medical ethics. In this collaboration, Cehat paid for complimentary  one-year subscriptions to individuals, and life subscriptions to educational  institutions, totalling Rs 58,000. It was hoped that life subscriptions would  reach the journal to more medical students, and the one-year subscriptions  would be renewed, increasing our subscription base.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given that a substantial  proportion of income from subscriptions came from this collaborative venture,  and we have no such collaborations currently, income from subscriptions in  financial year 2002-2003 is not expected to be as high.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, we also earned  income from life subscriptions which are over six years old and are therefore  no longer refundable. Using this money (Rs 25,080) as income to pay for the  journal's printing and posting in effect subsidises expenses which should have  been paid for through new subscriptions, and also eats into the reserve created  through life subscriptions.
				</p>
				<p>
					A third source of income  came from the sale of back issues of the journal, mostly in the form of CDs, to  Cehat. It was hoped that this income would be used towards new activities.  However, it has been used to for the journal and office functioning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fourth, while our  subscription base has stabilised after a sharp drop some years ago, it  continues to be very low. While the many letters we receive from all over India  and abroad indicate that the journal is being read and noticed in the field of  health and medical ethics in this part of the world, we are very far from our  goal of 5,000 subscriptions to assure financial stability.
				</p>
				<p>
					In fact, we have come no  closer to this goal in the last five years. Our subscription base went from  about 600 in 1998 to below 400 in 1999 to about 600 today. Life subscriptions  have increased from about 80 in 1998 to about 100 today. The sharp dip in 1999  was probably due to poor administration and follow-up of renewals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our current subscription  base is certainly not enough to sustain the journal's production -- and it is  unlikely to increase unless we make a special effort.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the journal's  registration application is still ongoing, we are not entitled to subsidised  postage. To give a break-up of the journal printing and postage expenses  totalling Rs 87,594, we spent Rs 42,346 on printing the journal, Rs 21,000 on  CDs of back issues and Rs 24,128.75 on postage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important  expense has been that of salaries for part-time administrative help. This  expense reflects the realisation that while FMES is a not-for-profit  organisation it cannot run on voluntary work alone. While our administrative  functioning has often left much to be desired, it is hoped that such complaints  are a thing of the past. We believe that a strong administration is essential  for the organisation to survive and grow. In fact, the expenses on salaries do  not reflect all the work that goes into the production of the journal,  maintenance of the website, and related activities. All this labour is done on  a voluntary basis. Likewise, many related costs are subsidised by members and  well-wishers.
				</p>
				<p>
					More efficient office  functioning, with prompt follow-up of expired subscriptions to get renewals,  keeping an eye on printing and postage costs, and so on, will have some impact  on our financial stability. Second, we must collect more subscriptions and look  at other means of raising funds. We must raise sufficient funds to meet salary  and office expenses as well as to pay for printing and posting the journal.
				</p>
				<p>
					What can we predict for  the future? For one, our expenses are bound to go up. We have worked from  members' residences and clinics. We plan to organise an independent office  where we can do all editorial and administrative work for the journal, as well  as provide a space for discussion for those interested in medical ethics. We  have also decided to improve the quality of paper and printing, both of which  require more money. Our website has been supported by friend and well-wisher Mr  Sabu Francis. We must at least reimburse the cost of server space, if not the  labour costs of maintaining the site. Likewise, we have benefitted from the  honorary work of Mr Sachin Mulgaokar who has audited our accounts without  charge all these years. Now that we are in slightly better financial shape, it  is only appropriate that Mr Mulgaokar be paid for his services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the last year or  so, we have been part of a number of local, national and international  initiatives in the area of medical ethics. And we start the second decade of  FMES, the journal has a new editorial team and expanded editorial boards. In  fact, the anticipated increase in expenses should not be seen as a liability  but as a challenge, as we grow in scope, reach, strength and stability.
				</p>
				<p>
					In all this, we are only  too aware that nothing is possible without the support and involvement of our  readers, contributors and subscribers. It is you who have made the journal what  it is today, and it is your inputs which will take it forward.
