				<h4>The Hippocratic oath</h4>
				<p>
					The foundations of modern medicine were laid down 2000 years ago in Greece. It  was the ingenuity of one man Hippocrates- who stressed careful clinical  examination, documentation and scientific logic that delivered medicine from  quackery and propelled it towards becoming an art and a science. Hippocrates  also advised on how a doctor should behave in society and bound all his  colleagues- for ages to come- by an oath. This oath continues to be sworn by  medical graduates even today.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is this oath? If analysed logically, it is simply a set of  rules which requires us to be compassionate and honest with our patients and  work in their interest. It forbids us from taking undue privileges in the  course of treating our patients. It implores us to guard our art and our  science, to improve upon it and to pass it on to future generations. It sets  guidelines for our behaviour and conduct with our colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical ethics have evolved around the guidelines in the oath.  As long as the intention of medical science is to care for and heal the sick,  the significance of the spirit of the oath will remain unchanged.
				</p>

				<h4>Unwelcome changes</h4>
				<p>
					Society is in a continuous state of evolution and change. What was forbidden  2000 years ago, on religious, moral and ethical grounds is accepted today. 'I  shall not give a pessary to a woman to cause abortion, ' was sacrosanct in the  days of Hippocrates. Termination of pregnancy is now acceptable in India on  social, legal, medical and humanitarian grounds. This reflects a change in  practice based on social and demographic pressures. Such pressures can,  however, be double-edged. Along with the vastly increased coverage of medical  practices by the media and the greed for riches, they are corroding medical  ethics and practice as never before.
				</p>
				<p>
					Who is to blame? Society? The legal system? Ourselves?
				</p>
				<p>
					A critical analysis of the situation as it prevails today shows  that we, in the profession, are to blame. Self-interest is paramount. We  sacrifice ethics readily to perpetuate our interests.
				</p>

				<h4>Exploitation of resident doctors</h4>
				<p>
					We watch our juniors being exploited by the State in silence. A resident doctor  works harder and is paid much less than a class IV employee in our public  hospitals. The ability and work of our junior colleague become less important  than those of a peon in the eyes of those in authority and yet, we remain  unmoved. Not wanting to antagonise the State or the public, we do not even  utter a word of sympathy. Instead, we go around explaining the injustice our  junior is doing to the public when he strikes work. Are we not bending ethics  to suit what we want?
				</p>
				<p>
					Yes, we do have a responsibility to society but don't we also  have a responsibility towards our juniors? Should we sacrifice their interest  every time they strike work? Is this the baptism they get on their entry into  the medical profession- a constant exploitation in the name of service? 'I  went through this, so must you. ' This oft repeated explanation from a senior  doctor to the residents is no justification at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medicine is based on the tripod of service, research and  education and ethics govern all three. A doctor has to be a physician, a  scientist and a teacher to guarantee service and progress.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics of teaching</h4>
				<p>
					What are the ethics that govern the teacher in us? Medicine is a science and an  art that has to be passed on from the teacher to the pupil. A cardiac murmur,  the signs of inflammation or the diagnosis of a rare disease have to be  lovingly taught. The craft of surgery has to be patiently passed on over years.  A delicate balance has to be maintained between protecting our commitment to  patient care and medical education.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intricacies involved are best understood by the doctors  themselves but politicians and businessmen feel otherwise. Whilst it is  possible to teach medicine using the blackboard and models, they have erected  medical colleges charging capitation fees all over the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					What did we do? We bent over backward to recognise them and in  doing so, further lowered the standards of medical education in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					Were we not ethically bound to prevent this sorry state? When  merit should be the sole criterion for entry into medical colleges, we have  allowed an undeserving son of a rich man to buy his way into an MBBS degree and  have disallowed a deserving and motivated child of a poor person the privilege  of becoming a doctor.
				</p>

				<h4>The Consumer Protection Act (CPA)</h4>
				<p>
					What made the authorities place the medical profession under this Act? Was it  the corrosion of our ethics? Were doctors perceived as having turned into reckless,  rapacious monsters? Were we seen as behaving like traders? At least this is  what our parliamentarians, Supreme Court judges and journalists feel. So by a  single Act of Parliament, we were equated with traders in our country. This has  slashed the fine thread of faith between us and our patients. A recent  judgement from the Supreme Court asks us to exercise 'reasonable care' in  dealing with our patients. What is 'reasonable care'? We do not know. Our  teachers taught us to care and do our best for all our patients irrespective of  caste or class. If quick justice was one of the main reasons to put doctors  under the CPA, I wonder if the judges would be willing to give up their ten  weeks of yearly vacation to clear our judicial backlog.
				</p>
				<p>
					The act has brought us at a crossroad of patients' interests and  the protection of our reputation. Defensive medicine, as practised using  western standards, may become the norm for 'reasonable care'. If this comes to  pass, the costs of medical care will pass beyond the reach of most of those in  the middle class.
				</p>
				<p>
					The average patient continues to have faith in his doctor and we  are using our clinical skills to the utmost, to deliver quick, good quality  service at a reasonable cost. The CPA now lurks in our minds. There is also a nagging  anxiety about possible vindictive behaviour by some patient. The CPA may make  it impossible for us to restore the doctor-patient relationship of yore. This  will hurt the patients and society more than it will the doctors. The redeeming  factor will be the force of medical ethics that requires us to treat our  patients with the same sincerity, compassion and care as before.
				</p>

				<h4>The doctor-doctor relationship</h4>
				<p>
					This has been discussed and written about at length. A major part of the  Hippocratic oath and the enunciated principles of medical ethics, however,  refer to the doctor-doctor relationship. A physician is a part of society and,  like everyone else, has been caught in the pursuit of self-glory; prestige and  materialistic gain. I do not see anything wrong in this. A physician must have  a comfortable living standard for his family and himself. He is an important,  learned member of the society and is entitled to the best that society has to  offer.
				</p>
				<p>
					But somewhere? during this pursuit, has he trampled upon the legitimate  rights and opportunities of his colleagues? That is the crux of the problem. If  the doctor-patient relationship is at a low ebb, the doctor-doctor  relationship has touched rock bottom. The exploitation of fellow professionals  is discouraging new entrants into the field to such an extent that they search  for greener pastures abroad. The loss of highly qualified colleagues to  countries such as the United Kingdom, America, Australia, Canada and the middle  East is reaching alarming proportions. It is time the profession devises  methods to reverse this brain drain. It is our ethical duty to our country to  do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					Monetary exploitation of a doctor by a doctor is a reality  today. Has it made the doctor happy? Is the medical profession satisfied with  the state of affairs today? Do we, in our moments of solitude, believe in what  we are doing? Discussions on this subject invariably lead to justification of  present conduct. Do these arguments sound convincing? Definitely not.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are behaving no better than middle-men. A middle-man is, at  least, open enough and both parties willingly pay him his share. If we have the  conviction of our actions, let us muster the courage to come out into the open.  Let us announce the system of split fees and unload the guilt from our  consciences. There will be an emotional catharsis as we boldly say to society:  'We split fees because we believe in it and as it is our means of livelihood.'  However, if we are unwilling to do so, it is time we find alternative means for  bettering our standards and not depend on exploiting our colleagues.
				</p>

				<h4>Ethics in the 21st century</h4>
				<p>
					Will ethics become extinct? Will the Hippocratic oath become irrelevant? I  believe the answer is an emphatic 'No!' Ethics is enshrined in the essence of  our profession and is responsible for its nobility. In ethics lie the virtues  of our profession. The physician without ethics lacks a soul. It is, then, even  more important to guard it with all our might, against the onslaught by the  forces of rampant commercialism.
				</p>

				<h4>Past glory</h4>
				<p>
					There are important moments in the history of a profession. We see them as  landmarks of achievement, discovery and social contribution. Our profession has  had many such glorious moments. The observations of Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph  Lister are of no less importance than those of an Einstein. The nobility of  Louis Pasteur or Albert Schweitzer is matched by few in any other profession.  We have, thus, inherited a glorious tradition. It is due to the efforts of the  likes of these giants that we owe the reverence in which our patients hold us.  When they confide their innermost thoughts in us, and trust us to heal, wipe  tears and bring back smiles, they do so out of faith born of that tradition.  Let us not betray that faith. If we hold fast to the ethical principles that  govern our profession, we shall have the means for performing our duties  without, in any way, letting down our forebears.
				</p>
				<p>
					The prophetic words of Hippocrates must resound in our ears all  the time. 'Now if I keep this oath and break it not, may I enjoy honour in my  life and art, among all men for all times. But if I transgress and forswear  myself, may the opposite befall me.'
