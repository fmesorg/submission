			<h3>National Vaccine Policy: ethical equity issues</h3>

				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The ministry of health and family welfare published the nationalvaccination policy in April 2011. The policy document drew severecriticism from several public health experts. A review of the print andweb-based literature on the national vaccine policy was done andthe issues of ethics and equity involved in introducing new vaccinesunder the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) were studied.
				</p>
				<p>
					The average coverage of the UIP vaccines at the national levelis below 50%. Despite this, the policy document did not stateany concrete strategy for increasing the coverage. The mainstumbling block for evidence-based vaccine policy in India is thelack of reliable epidemiological data, which makes it difficult forthe National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation to offersound technical advice to the government. No attempts have beenmade to prioritise diseases or the selection of vaccines. The policysuggests the introduction of the following vaccines in the UIP:Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcal vaccine, rotavirusvaccines and human papillomavirus (HPV). This selection ison the grounds of the vaccines' availability, not on the basis ofepidemiological evidence or proven cost-effectiveness. This is acritical review of the current vaccination policy and the move toinclude the rotavirus and HPV vaccines in the UIP.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					A review of the literature was made through a search of thepublished articles, printed and web-based (Pubmed andGoogle), on the subject from August 1, 2012 to December30, 2012. The keywords or phrases used for the search were'vaccine policy', 'cost-effectiveness', 'ethical issues in vaccination','rotavirus vaccine', and 'human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine'.Various appropriate combinations of the keywords or phraseswere also used. The references of selected articles werescrutinised further to access more literature. Only articlespublished in English from January 2000 to December, 2012,were included in the review (Fig 1). These included bothoriginal studies and review articles (print 14+web 43).

It wasformulated following judicial prompting by the Delhi HighCourt during the hearing of a public interest petition thatalleged that the newly introduced vaccines (pentavalent) in thecountry lacked sufficient evidence and asked the governmentto state its policy on vaccines <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhavi Y, Puliyel JM, Mathew JL, Raghuram N, Phadke A, Shiva M, Srinivasan S, Paul Y, Srivastava RN, Parthasarathy A, Gupta S, Ranga U, Lakshmi VV, Joshi N, Nath I, Gulhati CM, Chatterjee P, Jain A, Priya R, Dasgupta R, Sridhar S, Dabade G, Gopakumar KM, Abrol D, Santhosh MR, Srivastava S, Visalakshi S, Bhargava A, Sarojini NB, Sehgal D, Selvaraj S, Banerji D.

					The UIP in India is one of the largest in the world, targeting27 million infants and 30 million pregnant women everyyear. While Indian manufacturers provide 43% of the globalvaccine supply, the average coverage of the UIP vaccines atthe national level is below 50% <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Despite this, the policydocument does not put forward a concrete strategy toincrease coverage and does not propose any mechanismto improve the availability of vaccines for the remaining50%, except offering incentives for auxiliary nurse midwives.All doses of the currently included diphtheria, tetanusand pertussis vaccine (DPT) cost less than Rs 15, but theproduction remains erratic and demand-supply gapscontinue. The difference between requirement and supply in 2010-11 was 13.7 million doses for the BCG vaccine and 40.9million doses for the DPT vaccine (50%) <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dutta AG.

				</p>
				<p>
					The vaccine policy states, "Diseases which are prevalent indeveloping countries are often different than the ones indeveloped countries; majority of the vaccine research isbeing done in developed countries and focus on the diseasesprevalent in those countries."(<a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

				<p>
					One of the main stumbling blocks for an evidence-basedvaccine policy in India is the lack of reliable epidemiologicaldata. There are insufficient data on the actual prevalence andincidence of disease, pathogen strain/serotype variations, andimmunity with and without vaccination among populationsof different geographical regions/age groups <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Puliyel J.

Beyond thecriteria named for the selection of diseases of public healthimportance, no attempts have been made to prioritise diseases.Our vaccination policy has suffered a great deal on account ofthese limitations.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for vaccines to be included in the UIP, the policy declaresthat the following factors need to be considered: "safety andefficacy of the vaccine; affordability and financial sustainabilityof the vaccination programme, even if the initial introduction issupported by an external funding agency; programme capacityto introduce a new antigen, including cold chain capacity;availability of a domestic or external vaccine productioncapacity; the cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programmeand also of the alternatives other than vaccination" <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

					The policy stresses the introduction of the following vaccines:Hib vaccines, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, rotavirusvaccines and vaccines for HPV, the burden of which is estimatedto be high, with the vaccine having considerable potential toreduce child mortality.

An attempt has been made to incorporate the principlesof ethics and equity in the inclusion of newer vaccines bysaying, "The new vaccines which are relatively more expensivethan traditional vaccines are commonly used by the upperand middle class families through personal resources from theprivate market.

					The additional considerations which must be taken into account are <a class="reference" href="#fiftyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Comeau P. Debate begins over public funding for HPV vaccine. CMAJ.2007;176:913-14." id="57">(57)</a>: (i) the practical experience from HPV vaccination programmes worldwide has been limited; (ii) there is reluctance to accept a vaccine to prevent a sexually acquired infection that causes cancer only sometimes, and prevents infection only if it is completed before exposure; (iii) vaccination does not confer protection against all causes of cervical cancer; and (iv) an HPV vaccination programme has been rejected by some developed countries for the reasons discussed above <a class="reference" href="#fiftyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Comeau P.

					GAVI is the major external funding agency for HPV in India andit has included HPV in its Advanced Market Commitment plan<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sarojini NB, Srinivasan S, Madhavi Y, Srinivasan S, Shenoi A. The HPV vaccine: science, ethics and regulation. Econ Pol Wkly. 2010 Nov;XLV:27-32." id="18">(18)</a>. This illustrates how the promotional practices of drugcompanies, pressure from powerful international organisations,and the co-option of India's medical associations to uncriticallyendorse a vaccine are influencing public health priorities <a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sarojini NB, Srinivasan S, Madhavi Y, Srinivasan S, Shenoi A.
