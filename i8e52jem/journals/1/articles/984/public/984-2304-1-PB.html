				<h4>Lone crusader for ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Fighting  for ethics is never simple, as a doctor from Kerala realised during his long  crusade. In 2008, Dr KV Babu, an ophthalmologist practising in Payyanur, was  offended by the numerous endorsements of commercial products in the media by  none other than the Indian Medical Association (IMA). His plea was that an  endorsement by the IMA of a particular brand of oats or fruit juice was equivalent  to an endorsement made by him, as a member of the organisation. He felt that  when such an action was a direct violation of the Code of Medical Ethics  Regulations 2002, laid down by the Medical Council of India (MCI), it was his  duty to complain to that body. However, five years down the line, the matter is  still pending before the council's ethics committee.
				</p>
				<p>
					The MCI has delayed its decision on the issue that questions  its own jurisdiction over the IMA, which has, in turn, tried unsuccessfully to  expel the feisty doctor. Dr Babu has fought this battle at his own cost,  spending over Rs 50,000 on trips to Delhi. He has had to file RTI applications,  and write letters to the health ministry, the chief information commissioner  and even the National Human Rights Commission to get the MCI to heed his  arguments. Responding to the council's view that it cannot take action against  associations, Dr Babu filed complaints against all 187 doctor members of the  association's central working committee. Eventually, the MCI ruled against the  endorsements and penalised two leading office-bearers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Babu, meanwhile, stands firm in his fight against his  expulsion, saying: "It is law-breakers who ought to  be expelled, not those who uphold the law."

				<h4>Serious lapses in "welfare" schemes</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty-three children died on July 16, 2013 after consuming a meal at a  primary school in Gandaman village, near the town of Chhapra in Bihar. The meal  of rice and soybean was served under the mid-day meal scheme, and was later  found to contain the insecticide, monocrotophos. The media has analysed the wider implications of the tragedy and highlighted  the callous manner in which such welfare schemes are being implemented.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  editorial in the <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em> cites a programme  evaluation report, dated May 2010, by the Planning Commission that found  serious lapses in the infrastructure provided and the quality of food. The  tragedy has exposed several aspects of the negligence associated with the  implementation of welfare schemes in the country. These include the following.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Programmes such as the mid-day meal scheme are characterised  by class discrimination. The same goes for the public distribution system for  foodgrains, in which no one takes responsibility for delivering good-quality  services to the poor citizen, and for infrastructure such as clinics and school  buildings, which are hopelessly inadequate. Powerful local politicians and  contractors embezzle the funds provided for these purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
						There was a woeful absence of facilities, including  transport and personnel at the healthcare centres where the poisoned children  were taken, right from the local centre to a public hospital in Chhapra town to  the intensive care unit in Patna Medical College Hospital.
					</li>
					<li>
						Primary service providers, such as cooks, helpers, midwives,  contractual teachers and anganwadi workers, who are employed on contract, are  not even paid the minimum wage.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pesticides  such as monocrotophos, said to have been the culprit in this case, and  butachlor, are widely used in several Indian states for crops like vegetables,  fruits and chillies. The used containers are left lying around and can easily  harm the unwary or children, or be misused by criminals. This continues despite  the fact that monocrotophos is banned in 46 countries.
					</li>

				<h4>NEET judgment in contravention of earlier SC decisions</h4>
				<p>
					A recent controversial judgment of the Supreme Court of India  held that the Medical Council of India's (MCI) proposed national  entrance-cum-eligibility examination (NEET) is violative of Article 19(1) (g)  25, 26 and 30, under which citizens are free to practise any profession and  linguistic and religious minorities are free to set up and manage educational  institutions. The majority judgment of Justices Kabir and Sen held that the MCI  had exceeded its powers by declaring a single-window admission process for  medical colleges all over the country, and further, that since educational  standards vary across the country the process will not ensure a level-playing  field.
				</p>
				<p>
					An article in <em>The Hindu</em> analyses how this  latest verdict has gone against the principles laid down in the earlier  judgments of the apex court. In the Unnikrishnan case of 1993, a constitution  bench had stated that education "can neither be a  trade or business, nor can it be a profession within the meaning of Article  19(1)(g). Trade or business normally connotes an activity carried on with a  profit motive. Education has never been commerce in this country." In 2002, an  11-judge bench had declared: "Inasmuch as the occupation of education is, in a  sense, regarded as charitable, the government can provide regulations that will  ensure excellence in education, while forbidding the charging of capitation fee  and profiteering by the institution. Since the object of setting up an  educational institution is by definition 'charitable', it is clear that an  educational institution cannot charge such a fee as is not required for the  purpose of fulfilling that object."In yet  another judgment in 2005, a seven-judge bench had stated: "Holding of such common entrance test followed by  centralized counselling or, in other words, single-window system regulating  admissions does not cause any dent in the right of minority unaided educational  institutions to admit students of their choice."

				<h4>Malnutrition deaths in outskirts of Mumbai</h4>
				<p>
					Within the short period of April to June 2013, 171 children  in the age group of 0-6 years have died in the tribal belt of Maharashtra,  including Shahpur, Jawhar and Mokhada talukas, very close to Mumbai. During the  same period last year, 184 children had died, 141 of them in the age group of  0-1 years. Of the 171 children who died this year, 131 were in the age group of  0-1 years and 40 between 1 and 6 years of age. In 2013, 173 children in the  area have been diagnosed as "severe acute malnourished" and 3403 as "moderate  acute malnourished."
				</p>
				<p>
					After 258 deaths attributable to malnutrition had occurred in  Jawhar tehsil in 1992, the government had set up special projects for the  tribal areas of the state. Over Rs 2118 crore has been spent on these projects  over a 21-year period. The Thane zilla parishad is said to have a budget thrice  the size of that of the state of Kerala and five times that of Goa.
				</p>
				<p>
					Government health officials attribute the problem to the geographical  nature of the region, early marriages,  malnourishment of mothers, poor awareness about family planning practices and  superstition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indavi Tulpule, an activist of the Shramik Mukti  Sanghatana, an advocacy group, says, "The government needs to starts looking at  malnutrition as a symptom of a larger developmental malaise affecting this  region and work holistically with [a] multi-pronged approach. Land is being  diverted from agriculture and food crops on the one hand and on the other,  people simply have no work. Even if you ignore the problems in the public  distribution system, this means their capacity to buy food is compromised,  resulting in hunger and malnutrition." The administration has an ethical  responsibility to prevent the country's children from starving to death.  Furthermore, when this occurs so close to the metropolis, remote location and  backwardness can hardly be a justification for neglect.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Rajasthan's tribal belt, where one-third of the children in the age group of 0-3 years were  found malnourished and 80% anaemic, district officials have declared an  incentive scheme. A reward of Rs 100 is to be given to government health  workers who bring in a malnourished child for treatment. Officials say this  will be in addition to a payment of Rs 135 being  made, per day for 10 consecutive days, by the health department to the parents  of a child admitted to a centre for malnourished children. The new scheme will  include auxiliary nurses, midwives, anganwadi workers and <em>asha sahayoginis</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Small steps of this kind may show serious intent, but a major overhaul  of all such schemes is essential.

				<h4>Government eases compensation norms in clinical trials</h4>
				<p>
					After  drawing flak from the clinical trials industry for its reforms relating to  compensation for participants who suffer adverse events during trials, the  government has amended its own revised guidelines. Uncertainty regarding the fallout of the earlier  reforms is said to have thrown the clinical trials industry into the doldrums,  causing an estimated loss of about Rs 900-1200 crore over the last six months. The revised guidelines had stated that participants who  suffered death or injury would have to be compensated even if these events were  not necessarily the consequences of the trial. Under the new guidelines, a  participant will be awarded compensation only if the death or injury is proved  to have been caused by the trial. These modifications have been recommended by  the Drug Technical Advisory Board and accepted by the health ministry. Further  changes include the following.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Medical management will be provided only in case the injury  is due to activities related to the clinical trial, "as the free medical  management may create undue influence for the patient to enrol in a clinical  trial."
					</li>
					<li>
						The period for reporting serious adverse events and fixing  the quantum of compensation has been extended from 21 to 30 days.
					</li>
					<li>
						The  deadline for an independent expert committee to establish the cause of death  during a trial has been increased from 30 to 60 days.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "licensing authority" or Drug Controller General of  India may now decide on the amount of compensation and cause of death up to two  months after receiving the expert committee's report.
					</li>

				<h4>Government policy moves away from family planning</h4>
				<p>
					"Maternal  and child mortality are the major issues faced by India and not population  growth. The days of high fertility rate are over," according to SK Sikdar, the deputy commissioner and head of the family  planning division, Union ministry of health. The health ministry has stated  that it is "repositioning" its policy focus away from birth control towards  maternal health and spacing of pregnancies. However, with a maternal mortality  rate of 212 per 100,000 live births, the country has a long way to go to reach  the Millennium Development Goal of 109 by 2015.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  new strategy is "completely free of taboos and coercion. We have also moved  from a camp-based approach where our health workers had a target to achieve.  Instead, we now have fixed-day services for women in clinics," said Anuradha  Gupta, the mission director of the National Rural Health Mission.
				</p>
				<p>
					Activists  have greeted these statements with caution. Jasodhara Dasgupta of the National  Alliance for Maternal Health and Human Rights said, "We would welcome the  policy by the government, but my personal experience shows the government still  concentrates on target numbers more than the quality of services." She pointed  out that the burden of birth control is still borne by women, who also face the  accompanying violations of human rights at many government-organised camps.

				<h4>Controversial tests on H7N9 flu virus</h4>
				<p>
					A group of researchers working on  the Influenza A H7N9 virus has, in a letter to <em>Science</em> magazine, put  before the public its case for gain of function (GOF) studies to create viruses  with varied properties in the laboratory. The epidemiologists, led by Ron  Fouchier and Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin, say that their  earlier experiments, on the same lines, with the H5N1 flu virus had aroused a  storm of protest and been virtually shut down for a year. They now want to explain to the public the nature  and importance of their work in the interests of transparency. According to  them, so far, research has studied "the wild-type avian A (H7N9) viruses in  terms of host range, virulence, and transmission" and they are evaluating the  effectiveness of antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates."
				</p>
				<p>
					Researchers "use several techniques to give viruses characteristics that  they don't have in nature, such as the ability to infect new species or  transmit more easily through the air. Such studies are critical to  understanding the sometimes subtle changes that can make a bird virus a  pandemic threat." The Fouchier group argues that traditional epidemiological  testing does not enable healthcare authorities to tackle pandemics in time.  However, scholars opposing the tests are very sceptical, arguing that the justification  for carrying out this research is unconvincing and that the precautions  outlined by the group cannot guarantee safety.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the characteristics given  to viruses in GOF studies could be easier transmission and the ability to  infect more species. These could be potentially disastrous if the viruses were  to escape from the laboratory or get into the hands of terrorists, say critics.

				<h4>Survey shakes up medical teachers</h4>
				<p>
					According to a survey carried out recently at the Grant Medical College  in Mumbai, medical students  pointed to continued absenteeism, lack of clarity  in teaching and ignorance of the subjects taught as the three worst failings of  their professors,.
				</p>
				<p>
					The survey covered 900 students  from the first to third years. They were asked to rank their professors, from  all 12 departments, on a score of 1 (worst) to 10 (best). The students were  encouraged to be frank, with no obligation being placed on them to mention  their names or roll numbers. The participants were the most indignant about  those teachers whom they said they had never even seen on campus.
				</p>
				<p>
					The survey was initiated by the  dean, Dr TP Lahane, who said that though the college is a reputed institution, "not many of our students are able to crack the All India Post-Graduate Medical  Entrance Exams." He concluded, "This survey gives a fair idea of where the  problem lies." In the survey, the pathology and forensic departments fared the  worst, while the biochemistry and anatomy departments were rated the highest. The teachers have apparently taken the survey  seriously and say they intend to improve their performance. This is a good  augury for the maintenance of standards in medical education which have been a  cause for concern all over the country. More colleges in India should take a  leaf out of Dr Lahane's book. There are plans for a follow-up survey after six  months.
