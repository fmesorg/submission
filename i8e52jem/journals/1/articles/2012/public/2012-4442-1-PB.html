				<h4>Birth by stars</h4>
				<p>
					Birth is a natural phenomenon which may sometimes need assistance in the form of application of forceps or surgery or induction of labour. These interventions are decided on the merits of a case, keeping the interests of the woman and/or unborn baby, and are done by the obstetrician.
				</p>
				<p>
					These days some families consult astrologers to learn the most auspicious time for birth and then insist that the baby be delivered precisely at that auspicious moment. This practice must be opposed vehemently. The auspicious time pronounced may be prior to the expected time of the birth, thus depriving the newborn of physiological benefits which accrue during the intrauterine life, which may be shortened by active intervention. Alternatively, if the natural birth process starts earlier than the suggested time for birth, parents may insist that delivery be delayed, thus putting the woman and the baby to risk. Important family functions or travel schedules of the pregnant woman may also be reasons for such requests. Moreover, if such practices are encouraged, in future, astrologers might start forecasting the auspicious time for the conception of a male child.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some obstetricians may agree to such interventions to oblige the family, or out of fear of losing the patient and for financial considerations. Obstetricians must keep the interests and safety of the mother and baby uppermost and not be a party to iatrogenic risks caused by the interventions because of considerations other than medical or surgical indications.
