					Election to any position on the Medical Council of India
					- as, indeed, to any responsible position on any public
					service agency - ought to be on the basis of integrity,
					competence, proven service to fellow-citizens and an
					aptitude for the position.
				</p>
				<p>
					As is common knowledge, elections to our national and
					state-level medical councils are fought with just one aim: to
					enrich oneself personally. Expenditure of huge sums; a total
					lack of scruples; political connections; a compulsive desire
					to grab power by any means, both fair and foul and finally,
					ruthless pursuit of the goal of personal enrichment are
					absolute necessities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given these conditions, it is not surprising that our medical
					councils are hopelessly corrupt, incompetent and
					disinterested in the common good. No wonder, the Delhi
					High Court in a recent judgement labeled the Medical Council
					of India as 'a den of corruption'.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reported sum spent by candidates for election as
					President of the Medical Council of India exceeds a crore of
					rupees. Were the actual figure even a tenth of this amount it
					is easy to see how no honest individual can ever aspire to
					serve in this position. It is also obvious that a person
					spending such a huge sum will have as his primary goal the
					recovery of his capital investment along with 'adequate'
					returns on it in the shortest possible period. The seeds of
					corruption have already been sown.

				<h4>Two encouraging events.</h4>
				<p>
					Thanks to the crusading efforts of a handful of individuals,
					we are provided a glimmer of hope.
				</p>
				<p>
					The setting aside of the fraudulent results of the elections
					to the Maharashtra Medical Council was the first of these
					events.
				</p>
				<p>
					More important is the recent decision by the High Court in
					Delhi against Dr. Ketan Desai, President of the Medical
					Council of India. After the Court found him guilty of
					corruption he was forced to resign from the Selection
					Committee of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much remains to be done. The identification of wrongs in
					bodies such as the Medical Councils by our courts is a
					great step forward but cannot, by itself, bring about any
					permanent change.
				</p>
				<p>
					Take the example in Maharashtra. Despite the passage of
					many months, nothing further has been done to restore
					normalcy to this body or eliminate the many inadequacies
					that permitted fraud over decades. The government rests,
					having followed the court directive to appoint an
					administrator. In all probability it will continue its siesta till the court is moved once again - against many odds and with
					the expenditure of much time, energy and money - and
					convinced to issue a fresh directive.
				</p>
				<p>
					If events run true to form, a similar fate will befall the
					Medical Council of India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Making malpractice difficult, if not impossible, requires
					major changes in the rules and regulations governing medical
					councils, their constitutions and their modes of operation.
					These changes must liberate these councils from control by
					the politicians and the bureaucrats both at the central or
					state levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the moment even the members purporting to represent
					the state governments in the Medical Council of India are
					nominated by the Central Government. In addition, New
					Delhi appoints another eight members as government
					nominees. This results in automatic 'election' of a
					government-backed individual as President of the Medical
					Council. The President enjoys unfettered powers for five
					long years of his term. Since there is no bar on repeated reelections
					of the same individual, a person can stay as
					President of MCI virtually for life! Such a long duration of
					control over the Council by one individual breeds vested
					interests and corruption. Besides younger entrants to the
					profession are denied the opportunity to bring new ideas.
					All these need to be changed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The workings of these councils must be totally transparent
					both to members of the medical profession and to the public
					at large.
				</p>
				<p>
					These goals, by themselves, pose formidable difficulties
					under present circumstances. Let us however, for a moment,
					imagine that they have, somehow, been achieved. We would
					still have a long way to go for there is yet another essential
					requirement for the restoration of normalcy - a change in the
					character of the medical professional.
				</p>
				<p>
					Honest, dedicated and sincere doctors must be encouraged
					to stand as candidates to these councils. The rest of us
					must support such candidates and ensure their election. We
					must also guarantee the failure of any person demanding
					unmarked ballot papers or using other unfair means to
					frustrate the spirit of free and fair election.
				</p>
				<p>
					We must also monitor the functioning of these councils,
					make our displeasure at fraudulent or unethical practice
					known and felt and, in general, serve as watchdogs to keep
					the councils on the straight and narrow path.
				</p>
				<p>
					Should we prove capable of all this and more, we shall earn
					the gratitude of our fellow-citizens and of those who are yet
					to become doctors.
