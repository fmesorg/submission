				<h4>Placebos</h4>
				<p>
					The  issue of whether or no patients should be informed about placebos used in their  treatment follows the moral belief of the physician that the patient must be  told all about every measure used during his treatment. This, in turn, stems  from the desire to be truthful and honest. In this context a classic Indian  dictum is relevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					-The definition of the Sanskrit term <em>satyam</em> or truth is 'that which leads to good' and is  not merely restricted to factual veracity. A scriptural instruction illustrates  the difference. If a young woman is being chased by ruffians intending to  ravish her and you provide refuge in your home, you are not bound to tell the  truth when the ruffians knock on your door and seek her whereabouts. Barefaced  'truthfulness' and factual admission are clearly not the prescription in this  setting, even for one sworn to abjure falsehood.
				</p>
				<p>
					Religious works also speak of 'pious fraud'- a deception intended to benefit those deceived.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intention behind one's utterances and  deeds is crucial. I believe that all of us agree that the placebo-administering physician is unquestionably benign.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, the patient seeks cure. Whilst his  or her right to information and respect as an individual are very important,  the doctor's primary focus is on healing, using every available means. Given  this earnestness of motive, anything apparently contrary or even incidental to  this primary motive needs to be given the go by.
