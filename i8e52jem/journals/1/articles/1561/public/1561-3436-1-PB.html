				<h4>Islamic ethics of  organ transplantation <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Albar M.A : Islamic ethics of organ transplantation and brain death, Saudi Journal of Kidney Diseases and Transplantation, 1996; 7: 109-114." id="1">(1)</a></h4>
				<p>
					The importance and relevance of religion to medical ethics cannot be doubted.  What is the true role of a major world religion such as Islam in the newly  expanding field of organ transplantation? We found a recent editorial  informative.
				</p>
				<p>
					Islam, Albar points out, is not only a  religion but a way of life. Islamic ethicists have been active in recent years  to resolve issues in medical ethics with special reference to emerging  technology. Organ transplant surgery, though performed by many surgeons,  including those in the Muslim world, for a long time, is included in this  category.
				</p>
				<p>
					Islamic principles related to this discussion  pertain to the search for a remedy, finding the true value of a human being,  saving a human life and the importance of brotherhood. Man should seek remedies  against disease, which is a natural phenomenon. Blood and organ transplantation  have been found acceptable. It is of interest that porcine bone grafts have  been recorded in Islamic literature of the 13th century. In view of the recent  controversy on xenotransplantation, especially the misadventure in Assam, one  statement stands out:. "...Porcine xenografts and genetic manipulation may  solve the problem of shortage of organs... especially hearts..."
				</p>
				<p>
					The dignity of the human being must be  maintained, both in life and in death. Autopsies, anatomical dissection and  organ donation are accepted as they increase our understanding of the human  body and help save lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					Organ donation, however, must not harm the  donor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, since the human body is the property  of Allah, organ trafficking and commercialisation are unethical and explicitly  refuted by Islam.

				<h4>Market economics and  primary health care in Vietnam <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gellert G.A: The influence of market economics on primary health care in Viet Nam, Journal of the American Medical Association 1995; 273: 1498-1502." id="2">(2)</a></h4>
				<p>
					The economic reforms  introduced into South Viet Nam in 1986 and 1989 to reverse the disasters  created during earlier years have resulted in some harm to primary health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prior to these reforms, the government  provided all health care. Currently, less that 20% of all medical treatment is  provided by the public sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					"In the public health service, physicians  receive lower salaries... equipment is inferior... professionals experience  tedium and believe that they are not valued... (as a consequence) they  demonstrate a lack of interest in updating their knowledge and skills. These  negative attitudes may be producing some undesirable activities such as the  charging of extra fees... (and) referring patients for services to (their) own  private clinics. Unscientific practices may be encouraged... including  overtreatment... and inappropriate use of medical technology, pharmaceuticals  and procedures to generate revenue from fees..."
				</p>
				<p>
					Does this sound familiar?

				<h4>Physician-assisted  suicide <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lo B, Rothenberg KH, Vasko M: Physician-assisted suicide in context -- constitutional, regulatory and professional challenges. Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics 1996; 24: 181-182 (and subsequent essays 183- 242)." id="3">(3)</a></h4>
				<p>
					This essay opens a section of the Fall, 1996 issue of the <em>Journal of  Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics</em>dealing with physician-assisted suicide. It focuses on dilemmas  about physician assisted suicide (PAS) and care at the end of life. Questions  addressed include distress in a terminally ill person, refractory to even the  most skilled hospice care; dealing with requests from such a patient for a  lethal dose of medicine; guidelines for PAS to prevent abuse and error.
				</p>
				<p>
					Contributors include David Thomasma (Chicago),  Jack Schwartz (Office of the Attorney General, Baltimore), Franklin Miller and  colleagues (including Timothy Quill) from the University of Virginia, William  Bartholome (Kansas) and Diane Kjervik (Associate Dean, School of Nursing, North  Carolina).
				</p>
				<p>
					Guidelines already in use in the Netherlands  and Australia are discussed. The Dutch government commission report released in  1991 showed that 2300 actual cases of euthanasia and 400 cases of PAS had been  performed by then. The category of &lsquo;involuntary euthanasia' is briefly  considered. Examples include the denial of treatment to a newborn with severe  congenital abnormalities and avoidance of surgery in a patient with terminal  cancer of the neck known to be eroding the carotid artery. When the artery does  give way, the patient is treated with an increased dose of morphine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Bartholome's essay is poignant as he has  been diagnosed as having a fatal form of cancer and thus writes with deep  insight.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Kevorkian's actions are also discussed and  are compared with the less dramatic but more rational work of Dr. Timothy Quill  and other physicians. Indeed, the summing up by Quill and his colleagues (page  232 of this issue) makes excellent sense: "Some claim to be certain that  PAS is a grave wrong and that it will careen us down the slippery slope. Others  claim to be certain that we have a fundamental right to choose the time and  circumstances of our death with medical assistance. We are persuaded by neither  of these absolutes... The only way to test the validity of this hypothesis  (legalise PAS subject to careful regulation) is by a readiness to experiment  intelligently, to take the risk of being mistaken, and to make needed  corrections based on our knowledge of the results."

				<h4>Placebos <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Freedman B. Weijer C, Glass K.C: Placebo orthodoxy in clinical research parts I and II Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics 1996; 24: 237-259." id="4">(4)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Freedman and colleagues discuss various aspects of the use of placebos in  clinical research in two essays. Several myths are exploded. Whilst placebos  remain useful, it is important to remember that a new drug is best evaluated by  measuring it against the best existing therapy.

				<h4>Critical care nurses  and euthanasia, assisted suicide <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Asch DA: The role of critical care nurses in euthanasia and assisted suicide. New England Journal of Medicine 1996; 334: 1374-1379" id="5">(5)</a></h4>
				<p>
					A public debate, especially in the West, continues about euthanasia. David Asch  decided to investigate bclicfs and practices of nurses who might have had the  opportunity to practice euthanasia. Of 852 evaluable replies, 141 (17%)  reported that they had received requests from the patient or family to perform  euthanasia. 129 (16%) had acceded to the request. Some nurses even provided  euthanasia without any request.
				</p>
				<p>
					An editorial in the same issue (euthanasia and  nursing practice-right question, wrong answer) points out that such incidents  do occur. It also suggests improvements in the questionnaire.

				<h4>Russia today <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cassileth BR, Vlassov VV, Chapman CC: Health care, medical practice and medical ethics in Russia today. Journal of the American Medical Association 1995; 273: 1569-1573" id="6">(6)</a></h4>
				<p>
					This review is recommended. Since the decline of communism, several unsavoury  facts have emerged on the state of medical practice and research during the  totalitarian regime. "Soviet medical ethics did not protect patients from  being used in medical experimentation without their consent or knowledge...  Human beings were used in medical experimcntation without their permission,  explanation or indication of their right to decline..." The Nuremberg Code  did not appear in print in Russia until 1993 and the first ethics committee was  established in the Soviet Union only in that year.

				<h4>Murder in a medical  college <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Azariah J: Blood bath ethics in educational system Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics 1997; 7: 7" id="7">(7)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Azariah recounts a recent murder in a medical college in Chennai, Tamil  Nadu. The victim's 'crime': refusing to undergo ragging and torture by seniors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst medical ethical codes emphasise  philanthropy and the principle <em>primum non nocere,</em> would-be doctors appear to revel in violence and mayhem  towards their own colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is high time that bioethics is introduced  as a subject in the curriculum of all our college courses-arts, science and  medicine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ragging impinges on the fundamental rights of  the student. If attempts at resisting such bullying brings on torture and  death, what values are we imparting to our students?

				<h4>Japanese guidelines on  genetic counselling <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Matsuda I: Guidelines for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis Eubios Journal of Asian and International Bioethics 1996; 6: 138" id="8">(8)</a></h4>
				<p>
					The Japan Society of Human Genetics has laid down the following guidelines:
				</p>
				<p>
					Genetic counselling
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Genetic counselling should be carried out by a knowledgeable, experienced  counsellor.
					</li>
					<li>
						Accurate and current information should be provided to those seeking  guidance. Records must be preserved for at least five years.
					</li>
					<li>
						The person seeking counselling and family have the right to know all about  the prescribed tests and to refuse them
					</li>
					<li>
						Informed consent is essential
					</li>
					<li>
						The best interests of the subject must be protected at all costs.
					</li>
					<li>
						If a test or course of action is against social and ethical norms or against  the doctor's personal principles, the doctor has the right to refuse to  administer it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Personal genetic information is confidential
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Prenatal diagnosis
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Prenatal diagnosis in the first half of the  pregnancy should be attempted if there is a strong possibility of the foetus  harbouring a serious genetically transmitted disease.
					</li>
					<li>
						Invasive prenatal diagnosis using amniotic fluid or sampling the chrionic  willi may be considered only under special medical indications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Except in the diagnosis of an X-linked disease, the sex of the foetus should  not be revealed
					</li>
					<li>
						Efforts must continue to improve the accuracy of the results of prenatal  diagnosis.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Ethics Committees <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eichler H G: Hazards of misguided ethics committees. Lancet 1995; 346: 1115-1116." id="9">(9)</a></h4>
				<p>
					It goes without saying  that ethics committees must be scientific and inbependent of economic or  political interests. Hans-Georg Either writes, in a letter to the editor, that  whilst the introduction of ethics committees in clinical trials is commendable,  it is important to bear in mind some possible hazards-administrative or  bureaucratic nuisance created by these committees and even scientifically  incorrect conclusions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Poor science is unethical and when ethics  committees, themselves, display evidence of this, the blind acceptance of their  authority harms institutions. Eicher suggests a review of their decisions,  perhaps by a supraregional ethics committee.

				<p>
					Over the years, in spite of the fact that  there is a growing belief that ethical standards are declining and therefore an  apprehension that people's trust in doctors is being eroded, a recent survey in  Britain indicated that about 80% of the people trust their doctors compared  with 5% who trust politicians. I am unable to predict with any accuracy the  results of a similar survey in our country especially at the present juncture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nevertheless it is axiomatic that the basis of  any trust is the rapport built through a two-way communication between the  patient and the doctor. Indeed, if we look at the main reasons for which  patients sue their doctors, a study in the United States-the most litigious  nation in the world-showed that the primary reason was not the medical injury  itself, but the failure of communication. Patients sue because they were either  treated with contempt or condescension or excluded from essential information  and decision making.
				</p>
				<p>
					What was more revealing was the observation  that the vast majority of patients who did experience medical injury and  negligence never sue their doctors. This may be because these patients trust  their doctors and value their relationship which is personal, caring and  respectful.
				</p>
				<p>
					As noted medical educationist Eric Cassel  observed, "All medical care flows through the relationship between  physician and patient. The spoken word is the most important tool in  medicine."
				</p>
				<p>
					I must confess that this art of communication  is least understood and practiced by our hospital consultants, let alone being  demonstrated to their students. No amount of technological innovation or  revolution shall ever be a substitute for the doctor-patient relationship built  on mutual trust and sound communication. No amount of technology can ever be a  substitute for trust. We should not let technology dehumanise medicine.
