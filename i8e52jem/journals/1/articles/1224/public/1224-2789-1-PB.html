				<h4>Pre-test counselling for HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Even though the Indian Medical Association (IMA),  has guidelines that make it mandatory for anybody taking an HIV test to  receive pre-test counselling, most hospitals in Pune that this reporter visited  were not equipped with counselling cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Sanjay Mehendale, deputy director  of the National Aids Research Institute (NARI), said pre-test counselling was  perhaps one of the most important aspects of any HIV/AIDS awareness programme.  "Testing for HIV can put the patient through enormous stress and trauma,  since a lot of fear, stigma and dread is attached to the disease. Whether the  result is positive or negative, it is essential for the patient to go through a  thorough pre-test counselling," Mehendale said.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the IMA  guidelines a pre-test counsellor is supposed to make the patient familiar with  all the procedures required for the HIV test, and then ask the patient why s/he  has decided to go in for a test. If the patient has had a history of high-risk  behaviour, the counsellor has to explain the degree of risk to the patient.  Preparing the patient to accept the result is the next part of the procedure.  After the patient is informed about the various medical facilities which have  made it easier for someone to live with HIV, s/he has then to be asked  permission to carry on with the HIV test. Dr Vinay Kulkarni, HIV physician for  Jehangir hospital, acknowledged the importance of pre-test counselling.  However, he claimed that logistically, in Pune, it was not possible to counsel  every patient that goes through an HIV examination. "We give  pre-counselling to patients who volunteer for an HIV test. But for patients who  are undergoing surgery, we usually suggest a rapid screening since there are  more important factors that need to be taken care of. However, in this rapid  testing if we do discover an HIV positive case, we then refer them to a  counsellor before the news is broken," he said.
				</p>
				<p>
					HIV expert Dr Sanjay  Pujari also cited the sheer number of people going in for test as the reason  for the absence of pre-test counselling for HIV. "The number is so mind  boggling that the hospital authorities cannot cater to all the patients that go  in for a test. Besides, the tradition of medicine in India has always been very  fraternal. The physician always has an upper hand in medical matters and the  patient rarely objects to what the physician suggests. If the patients know  their rights, they can demand pre-test counselling," Pujari said.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Dr Mehendale, the importance of pre-test counselling cannot be  neglected. "There is hardly any investment required to set up a pre-test  counselling office. Even the counsellor doesn't need a formal degree. We at  NARI provide regular training programmes where we train volunteers to become  effective HIV/Aids counsellors," he said. The situation puts the onus on  the person going in for a test. One will be well within one's rights to ask for  a counsellor before taking the test. It could make all the difference.

				<h4>Forensic medical scams</h4>
				<p>
					The Jammu and Kashmir government suspended five  doctors and a police officer who were found to have been involved in a  controversy in the collection and transportation of samples for DNA tests to  ascertain the identity of the five deceased persons killed at  Pachalthan-Pathribal in Anantnag district of Kashmir in March 2000. The officers  placed under suspension are Dr Balbir Kaur, Head of Department of Forensic  Medicine, Dr Fazili, Associate Professor, Dr Abida Kouser, Forensic Medicine  department, all from Government Medical College Srinagar, Dr S M Saleem,  Nedical Officer in Anantnag and DSP Sheikh Abdul Rehman. An official spokesman  said that in view of the contradictory reports from Central Forensic Science  Laboratory (CFSL), Kolkata and the one received earlier from Centre for DNA  Finger Printing and Diagnostic Laboratory (FPDL), Hyderabad, the Government  authorities here have urged CSFL and FPDL to send their representatives to  collect fresh blood samples of the relatives of the deceased persons connected  with the Panchalthan-Pathribal incident.

				<h4>Treatment of HIV positive  patients</h4>
				<p>
					Private hospitals take money for conducting initial  tests and then tell patients to go to a government hospital for treatment as they  "do not belong here". HIV positive patients are made to stay in  isolation and attendants warned not to touch their 'highly-contaminated'  mattresses. Doctors working with HIV positive patients accused health providers  and hospitals of criminal neglect when dealing with HIV patients. Another  subject discussed was that of HIV, confidentiality and ethics. They spoke at a  Delhi workshop for HIV and AIDS organised by the Society for Civic Rights. The  workshop called for of training programmes and improving the quality of  professionals dealing with AIDS patients.

				<h4>Patient with HIV awarded  compensation</h4>
				<p>
					The Bombay High court directed KEM Hospital, Pune, to  bear all medical expenses for the treatment of a 13-year-old girl who  contracted HIV through blood transfusion while under neonatal care at the  hospital in 1988. The interim order was given on a petition filed by the girl  urging the court to direct the hospital to bear her medical expenses for life,  and compensate her for its negligence. The girl was born on December 2, 1988.  On December 15, 1988, she was admitted to KEM for neonatal septicaemia and  given blood transfusions. Since her discharge on January 1, 1989, she has been  in and out of the hospital for various infections. In May 2000 she was admitted  at KEM, where she was detected to be HIV positive. Her parents were found to be  free of the virus. The petition urged the bench to direct the hospital to bear  medical expenses including expenditure of drugs and to provide the girl  treatment free of cost, or alternately pay Rs 20,000 per month.

				<h4>They bought his kidney but they  didn't pay</h4>
				<p>
					Jarnail Singh, an unemployed resident of Chak Jinda  village, told the Jalandhar police that he had allowed his kidney to be removed  because Balbir Sehajpal, the recipient, and his wife, promised Rs 1.25 lakh in  cash and a loan of Rs 2 lakh to set up his own dairy. The transplant was done  after all formalities were completed, including video-taping of his consent. He  received Rs 5,000 and rations worth Rs 1,700 before the Sehajpals threw him  out. LK Yadav, SP, said a case had been registered against Sehajpal under  Section 420 of the IPC under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. A  notice has been issued to the hospital concerned under Sections 160 and 91 of  the Cr PC. Hospital authorities said they had not received a police  complaint."It is an effort to tarnish the image of the noble profession  and our doctor fraternity will not take this lightly," said a  spokesperson.

				<h4>Yet another kidney trade racket </h4>
				<p>
					Seven years after the Bangalore police cracked down  on an organised kidney trade, comes an even bigger racket has been unearthed in  Mandya district, Karnataka, by the district police. The players are the same &ndash;  impoverished donors willing to sell their organs for a reprieve from the burden  of indebtedness, generally well-to-do patients facing end stage renal failure  only too willing to buy a kidney in contravention of the law, a network of  agents and sub-agents with contacts in both these camps and in the Bangalore  hospitals where renal transplants are performed, laboratory technicians,  doctors and hospitals. Forty-seven residents of Hollalu village in Mandya  district have sold their kidneys, and there were at least 100 in the queue when  the racket was busted. (Incidentally, the going rate of Rs 35,000-Rs 40,000 has  not changed in the last five years.) Between January 1996 and today, over 1,000  applications for 'unrelated renal transplants' went before the government's  Authorisation Committee set up under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act,  1994. All but a few were accepted. It is suspected that nearly 80 per cent of  the applications have forged documentation &ndash; which, incidentally, is why the  police entered the scene, since the Act does not have scope for police action.  In 1998-99 and 1999-2000, Lakeside Medical Centre and Hospital conducted 86  unrelated transplants. The 'top performers': MS Ramaiah Institute of Nephrology  58; Bangalore Hospital 47; Manipal Hospital 28; and Mallya Hospital 12. All  were approved by the Authorisation Committee which for a short period included  one of the main accused in the 1994 kidney scam. "If there is an iota of  doubt over the genuineness of an application, permission should not be  sanctioned. On the contrary, they are approving most of the applications,"  said Dr H Sudarshan, chairman of the state's Task Force on Health and Family  Welfare. This article describes the kidney trade in the area, the authorisation  committee's functioning, and the limitations of current legislation.

				<h4>Debate on sex determination</h4>
				<p>
					Some comments from a discussion at the RN Ganguly  public forum on 'pre-conceptional sex selection: boon or bane?': Dr Rekha  Davar, member of the state's PNDT committee, said "The test was only  perpetuating gender bias in Indian society." Dr Aniruddha Malpani said it  was a couple's private decision to have an optimal family, "and if that  family includes a son, who are we as doctors... to tell him he cannot do so? If  everything has to be regulated on society's terms, why allow cosmetic surgery?"  Dr Sarla Malhotra from Chandigarh said in her 30 years of practice she had not  come across a couple wanting to abort a male foetus. Another doctor argued that  95 per cent of couples don't go for another child if they get a boy, but if  they don't, they will try for one. "What does that do to the population  explosion?"

				<h4>And some more comments on the  subject</h4>
				<p>
					The following question, and its answer, was printed  in a 'health education column of a leading English tabloid: "How soon can  one determine the sex of a foetus without endangering the baby?" The  doctor's answer: "The most conventional and non-invasive way to determine  the sex of a baby quite accurately at the 12th week is an ultrasound  examination." This advice was given &ndash; and printed in a newspaper &ndash; even as  the supreme court has directed all states to confiscate ultrasound equipment  from clinics being run without licenses, in order to stop sex determination  tests. From a 'health education column' by Dr Altaf Patel, professor at Grant  Medical College, Mumbai.

				<h4>IVF advances</h4>
				<p>
					At least five per cent of women who approach IVF  centres in Mumbai are past 50 years. While almost all doctors are comfortable  with women conceiving children between 40 and 46 irrespective of their  menopausal status, the question is: where does one draw a line? Or should one  draw a line at all? Dr Indira Hinduja believes that nobody has the right to  judge a couple's desire for when they want to have a child. Maria Ferreira, who  had her daughter when she was past 50, is emphatic that parents alone can take  a decision. Doctors and older parents say prospective parents are put through  innumerable physical and psychological tests before being given the IVF option.  However, Dr Rama Vaidya, president of the Indian Menopausal Society, thinks the  medical community could do with some guidelines paying special attention to the  health of the woman and child.

				<h4>Service in public hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					After 47-year-old Pravinaben Somapura had a cardiac  arrest in June 1999, an angioplasty showed that some of her cardiac vessels  were completely blocked, calling for an urgent operation. But LTMG Hospital at  Sion, Mumbai, would not conduct the surgery till it was paid Rs 58,000. It took  her family a year of visits and pleading to collect Rs 58,000 from 12 trusts.  The angioplasty was scheduled for March 10, 2001, but has been postponed  indefinitely because the hospital's angiography machine broke down. The hospital  refuses to transfer the money to another municipal hospital so that the  operation can be conducted there. Express News Service.

				<h4>Blood donation or competition?</h4>
				<p>
					Clubs and police stations in Kolkata are competing  to draw blood donors to their voluntary camps with incentives like bags and  wall clocks to donors. Debabrata Ray of the Association of Voluntary Blood  Donors, West Bengal, labels this an alarming trend. "Other than Rs 10  worth of nourishment, a donor card and a badge, a person should not be given  any incentive to donate blood," he says. Amit Ukil.
