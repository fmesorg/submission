				<p>
					A national conference on the evolving roles of ethics
					committees in India was held on May 31 and June 1, 2013.The
					conference was organised by the Apollo Hospitals Education
					and Research Forum, and supported by the Indian Council of
					Medical Research, Apollo Hospitals, Sanofi, and Quintiles.
				</p>
				<p>
					The stated objectives of the conference were to provide an
					overview of the workings of research ethics committees and
					practical training on the review and oversight process of clinical trials. It was also to discuss the development of guidelines and laws pertaining to ethics committees. It was designed for ethics committee members, investigators, members of
					regulatory bodies and non-governmental organisations,
					project managers and directors, and others in the field of
					contract research.
				</p>
				<p>
					While India has had a vigorous clinical trial industry, recent
					ethical controversies have led to a downward trend in the
					clinical trial field. This has also been accompanied by a
					"restrictive and sometimes not so facilitatory environment".
					The role of the ethics committees is seen as extremely
					important in re-establishing credibility and trust in the clinical trial system for regulators and the public at large.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the title implied, the conference focused on the role of
					ethics committees (ECs) in India, especially in the light of the
					above. It was acknowledged that the pharmaceutical industry
					itself could not go forward without well functioning ECs at all
					levels in the system. Most sessions dealt with how to structure
					and operate an EC, including the need to train members of
					the committee. Developing a quality culture for ethics review
					including standards, best practices, self assessment, flexibility,
					and independence is also essential. A question was addressed
					to the group as to how many ECs had a policy on exposing
					fraud and plagiarism. One EC reported having a clear policy on
					not tolerating plagiarism; none had a clear policy on exposing
					fraud.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was suggested that the Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Review, of which the Forum for Ethical Review Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific is a branch, could act as a body to certify many ECs. The Indian Society for Clinical Research (a private organisation established in 2005) is industry-supported but not an industry association. It has a website and produces an on-line journal which is available to those who pay a fee to join the organisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are studies that indicate that in institutions where clinical trials were conducted, there is better patient care. There is a need to educate the public on this and other potential
					benefits&mdash;a need to engage these stakeholders. Those
					responsible for ethical research are not just the investigators
					but also the sponsors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Questions were raised by Rule 122DAB-1 of the Drugs
					and Cosmetics Rules, especially in terms of compensation
					to subjects for injury and death. What is the definition of
					trial- related injury? Should those who receive placebo be
					covered for injury or death unrelated to the trial? How should
					compensation be calculated for injury or death? Who decides
					if an injury or death is study related? How long should the
					sponsor be liable after the study has been completed? If
					everyone who dies in a study is to be compensated, how will
					studies be done on any terminal disease, especially where the
					treatment may intentionally put the patient in harm's way?
					Why should there be compensation for a failure of intended
					benefit since that is often unknown when the trial begins-ie
					how can the intended affect be guaranteed? Connected to
					this question is the concept of equipoise. The compensation
					policies of the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia,
					and Peru were reviewed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 10-day turn-around period for reporting an injury or death
					was seen as inadequate, and suggestions were made for this
					requirement to be changed to two weeks to a month. The
					Drugs Controller General of India was asked to define what
					is meant by a 'clinical trial' and a 'trial sponsor' and to issue a
					written statement on this, as the answer to these questions was
					not clear to all in attendance. As one speaker observed, in times
					of conflict and public agitation there is a great opportunity for
					positive change.
