					Regarding my case study <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jamwal, Trivikrama Kumari: Case study: a professional deficiency. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; VIII (3): 91." id="1">(1)</a>, it is heartening to know there are fora that do not shy away from voicing  genuine and relevant issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my original article I had stated that the pregnancy that was the subject  matter for the article ended in a miscarriage. A subsequent pregnancy ended  with the birth of my daughter. The case study implies the pregnancy that raised  the issues of the attitude problem of practitioners ended happily. This was not  so.
