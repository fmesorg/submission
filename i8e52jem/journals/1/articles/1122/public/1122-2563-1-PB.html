				<h4>Remembering Bhopal</h4>
				<p>
					Suroopa Mukherjee's Bhopal gas tragedy: the worst industrial disaster in human  history is a book for 'young people on the threshold of their careers'. A  generation has grown up since the night of December 3, 1984, when tonnes of  deadly pesticide leaked out of storage tanks in Union Carbide's factory in this  central Indian city. Thousands of people were killed in one stroke and people  continue to die every day in Bhopal. The survivors continue to suffer more than  18 years later. Ms Mukherjee pulls together information from a variety of  sources including survivors' groups, organisations concerned with health and  human rights, and the media, to tell the story of the Bhopal gas disaster-who  was responsible, efforts to seek justice, and what is happening today. The book  is illustrated with charts, diagrams and a number of photographs by Raghu Rai.
