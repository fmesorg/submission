				<h4>Medical tuitions- a  viewpoint</h4>
				<p>
					A recent article lamented the growth of private coaching classes and medical  tuitions <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Madhok P: Medical tuitions Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5: 23" id="1">(1)</a>. The world has changed considerably since the years of our fathers  and grandfathers. Old paradigms and situations no longer necessarily work or  hold true. In this context, the concept of medical tuitions needs to be examined  with all its socio-economic ramifications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do students go for tuitions? There are  several reasons.
				</p>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						The student wants to get a high score or a  distinction.
					</li>
					<li>
						The student wants to pass.
					</li>
					<li>
						The student is coerced by the teacher into  getting tuitions under threat that she/he will otherwise fail.
					</li>
					<li>
						The parents are apprehensive about the  student's future and force her/him to take tuition.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The competition for postgraduate seats is cut-throat and in this scenario every mark counts. Students believe that special  coaching will help them get those extra marks and they are willing to pay for  this. To go one step back, if students are willing to pay any amount to get  question papers in the XIIth standard, paying for knowledge seems to be a very  innocuous act. To go one step forward, students are, in fact, now willing to  pay huge sums for those tuitions which guarantee them 'hot tips', 'sure  questions' or the marks they want. Parents, too, are willing to go to any  length to ensure that their child does not get left behind. This reflects the  general attitude of middleand upper class society where child-child rivalry and  competitiveness are marked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other factor is that students have got  used to tuition classes from the time they were in school and junior college, where  tuitions are <em>de rigeur </em>and raise no eyebrows. There are special tuition classes for  entrance examinations to medical colleges so why is there any surprise at crash  courses before students appear for their MD or MS examinations?
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical tuitions serve a purpose. The  standards of teaching in our medical colleges leaves a lot to be desired. There  is no uniformity in what is taught in the various institutions. Private medical  colleges are abysmally poor. B y distributing information -- albeit theoretical  -- uniformly, tuition classes give the students a sense of direction.  Knowledge, howsoever acquired, is beneficial.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with tuition classes lies not in  their-existence but in the manner in which they are conducted. Doctors who are  potential examiners have no business taking tuitions as they will obviously  favour their students when appointed examiners. They will subvert the  examination system to achieve their means. It is here that the authorities  (University of Bombay, Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, Government of  Maharashtra) have to step in. This, however, is an unlikely event, given the  manner in which they function.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical tuition is a variant of the prevalent  theme-private enterprise taking over the function of what should be an efficient  public service because of an obvious need. Special coaching of bright students  and clinics during the night, after the day's work has been completed, have  been going on for ages. We now have institutionalisation of this  extracurricular teaching and the addition of stiff costs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where do ethics come in? All we need is  regulation and, perhaps, even accreditation of these classes by a regulatory  agency such as the University of Bombay or the College of Physicians and  Surgeons.

				<h4>Humanities in medical  education</h4>
				<p>
					The section 'From other journals' in the January-March 1997 issue (<em>Issues in Medical  Ethics </em>Vol. 5, No. 1)  contained a reference to the introduction of the humanities into medical  education. Specifically, the item mentioned the use of poetry on medical rounds  with residents, as described by Horowitz in <em>The Lancet </em>1996: 347: 447-449.
				</p>
				<p>
					While Dr. Horowitz's efforts are laudable and  no doubt of value to his residents, readers of your journal should be aware  that what Dr. Horowitz describes is extremely modest and limited compared to  the extensive and sophisticated humanities curricula that have been firmly  integrated into many U. S. medical schools for thirty years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Indeed, the first such programme at any  medical sohool was introduced at the Penn State University College of Medicine,  where a full academic Department of Humanities was established in 1967. Since  that time, the disciplines of the medical humanities -- ethics, law,  literature, cultural studies, history, philosophy, and religious studies --  have been added to the faculties and required curricula at a large number of  schools.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your readers will find the best current review  of the state of the art in the humanities in medical education in a special  issue of the journal <em>Academic Medicine</em>, Vol. 70, No. 9 (September, 1995). The principal professional  society for teachers and scholars in the medical humanities, with over 800  members, is the Society for Health and Human Values, 6728 Old McLean Village  Drive, McLean, Virginia 22101) U S A (E-mail: <a href="mailto:shhv@aol.com">shhv@aol.com</a>). All interested  persons would be welcome to join. I certainly hope this information will be of  interest.

				<h4>Placebos</h4>
				<p>
					The  issue of whether or no patients should be informed about placebos used in their  treatment follows the moral belief of the physician that the patient must be  told all about every measure used during his treatment. This, in turn, stems  from the desire to be truthful and honest. In this context a classic Indian  dictum is relevant.
				</p>
				<p>
					-The definition of the Sanskrit term <em>satyam</em> or truth is 'that which leads to good' and is  not merely restricted to factual veracity. A scriptural instruction illustrates  the difference. If a young woman is being chased by ruffians intending to  ravish her and you provide refuge in your home, you are not bound to tell the  truth when the ruffians knock on your door and seek her whereabouts. Barefaced  'truthfulness' and factual admission are clearly not the prescription in this  setting, even for one sworn to abjure falsehood.
				</p>
				<p>
					Religious works also speak of 'pious fraud'- a deception intended to benefit those deceived.
				</p>
				<p>
					The intention behind one's utterances and  deeds is crucial. I believe that all of us agree that the placebo-administering physician is unquestionably benign.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ultimately, the patient seeks cure. Whilst his  or her right to information and respect as an individual are very important,  the doctor's primary focus is on healing, using every available means. Given  this earnestness of motive, anything apparently contrary or even incidental to  this primary motive needs to be given the go by.

				<h4>Cross practice</h4>
				<p>
					The editorial <em>Cross  practice at the cross roads </em>(<em>Issues in Medical Ethics </em>1996; 4: 103-104) aptly  represents the landmark judgement of the Supreme Court against non-allopathic  doctors practising allopathic medicine and vice versa. It also clearly states  that such practices violate, per se, the Indian Medical Council Act, constitute  medical negligence and attract fines or imprisonment.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is a disgrace for the Medical Council of  India that such a judgement became necessary. Does this august body know that  in Mumbai nursing homes and private hospitals are under the care of non  allopathic resident medical doctors employed by allopathic owners? These non-allopathic resident doctors not only manage general wards but also critical  areas such as intensive care units and intensive cardiac care units. They not  only attempt to interpret traces on cardiac monitors but also proceed to treat  them and even administer DC shocks on their own judgement. The specialists who  run such intensivecare units depend heavily on the findings conveyed by such  doctors over the telephone and proceed to recommend changes in therapy on the  basis of this information.
				</p>
				<p>
					A recently announced Heart Brigade attached to  a private nursing home sends out a non-allopathic doctor to the patient's home  when it receives emergency calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are those employing such non-allopathic  doctors not liable for medical negligence?
