				<h4>Sorry about that!</h4>
				<p>
					A vast majority of people believes that doctors are a negligent
					lot. This often implies that doctors are not courteous enough,
					are brusque to the point of being rude, are not available when
					needed, and prescribe unnecessary laboratory tests, scans
					and medicines. At a function organised by the Indian Medical
					Association on medical negligence, a veteran politician,
					otherwise very articulate, was at a loss to define it. Finally, he
					said, "Don't you people leave your scissors or gauze pieces
					in the stomachs of patients?" The usual complaints of being
					rude and unsympathetic pertain more to a lack of professional
					courtesy, which is our national trait. Doctors are no exception,
					though this national trait only explains their conduct and does
					not excuse or justify it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instances of leaving behind scissors and pieces of gauze in the
					abdomen of a patient are very rare. Such cases are uncommon
					to the extent of being anecdotal. Moreover, this would implicate
					only surgeons who operate on the abdomen and thus absolve
					a host of other surgeons, such as orthopaedic, neuro- and
					cardiothoracic surgeons, as well as all physicians. I do not
					think anybody will subscribe to the view that only abdominal
					surgeons are a negligent lot and, therefore, the question as to
					what constitutes medical negligence arises again. However, let
					us first consider the question of objects being left behind in
					the abdomen.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is impossible for any non-medical person or even for
					many in the medical profession, be they physicians, nurses
					or paramedical staff, to understand how an object can be
					left behind in the abdomen of the patient. In fact, only those
					surgeons who have regularly performed major abdominal
					operations, especially in emergency departments, can
					understand how such an unfortunate accident may take
					place. Any surgeon, anaesthetist, or nurse who has seen or
					performed an exploratory laparotomy for a gunshot wound
					in the abdomen, multiple stab injuries or injuries sustained
					in a bomb blast, or laparotomies for internal bleeding in the
					abdomen due to causes such as a ruptured spleen or ectopic
					pregnancy, would understand what I mean. From the moment
					the patient is wheeled in to the ward, it is a race against time
					for the surgeon in charge of the patient. After what the surgeon
					considers reasonable resuscitation with intravenous fluids,
					blood, etc, he requests his anaesthetist colleague to take the
					patient to the operation theatre. A dialogue of the following
					nature, which often becomes acrimonious, usually ensues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surgeon: Come on, let's hurry. We can't afford to lose any
					more time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anaesthetist: What did you say was his blood pressure? Eighty?
					Do you think he will (with) stand anaesthesia?
				</p>
				<p>
					Surgeon: I know what you mean. But we have no option.
					He will bleed to death.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anaesthetist: Why don't you rush two (units of ) blood and
					stabilise him a little more?
				</p>
				<p>
					Surgeon: We have already pumped in two units. I am
					saving one for surgery. No more blood is
					available. Come on yaar, we have to do him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anaesthetist: Have you explained (the high risk) to the
					relatives?
				</p>
				<p>
					It goes on like this for a while. Finally, the patient is moved to
					the operation theatre. The movements of the anaesthetist
					appear excruciatingly slow to the surgeon. Ultimately, the
					surgeon manages to open the abdomen. There is a wide gush
					of blood and intestines. Sponges are frantically inserted to stem
					the flow of blood. The surgeon sharply tells the assistant to help
					him find the source of bleeding. The nurse is told, for God's sake,
					to be prompt in passing the instruments. Someone is asked to
					speed up the drip and the infusion of blood. The anaesthetist
					says the blood pressure has fallen to 70 mmHg. The surgeon
					still cannot see where the blood is coming from. More packs
					are inserted. There is a free flow of adrenaline.
				</p>
				<p>
					This goes on for what seems to be an eternity, though actually
					it may be only 10 minutes. At long last, the source of bleeding
					is identified and steps are taken to stop it (more packs are
					inserted). When the bleeding is under control, the surgeon
					examines the intestine end-to-end to locate the perforations
					and seal them. A search is made for any other injuries, which are
					corrected. Two hours have passed. The anaesthetist menacingly
					tells the surgeon to hurry up because the patient's pulse is very
					feeble and the blood pressure is still very low.
				</p>
				<p>
					The physical and mental state of the surgeon at this point in
					time would make an interesting study for a psychologist. He
					is passing through this experience for the tenth, or perhaps
					the twentieth, time and certainly not the last one. His gloves,
					gown and feet are soaked in blood. Sweat flows freely from
					his forehead, even though it is December. He has a terrible
					and disgusting feeling that the patient might die before he
					can sew him up and send him out of the operation theatre.
					He silently curses the uncooperative anaesthetist. He berates
					himself for being overenthusiastic and conscientious. He prays
					to God to please bail him out this time and promises himself
					that he will never again operate on such a high-risk patient. A
					sense of extreme frustration and despair overwhelms him. He
					would like to spend some more time on tidying up the things
					in the patient's abdomen, but he knows he cannot afford to do
					that. He tells the nurse to make a sponge count to ensure that none is left inside, while at the same time, he looks all around
					in the abdomen to make sure of the same thing. At last, he
					sews up the patient and sends him to the ward. The floor of the
					operation theatre looks like a place abandoned hastily after the
					perpetration of a violent crime.
				</p>
				<p>
					In spite of the fact that a careful search is made for sponges
					or clamps, it is extremely easy for them to remain concealed
					in the mass of intestines or the various corners and cavities
					of the abdomen. This is not just because surgeons are tired,
					desperate to sew up patients and keep them alive. A bloodsoaked
					sponge can be difficult to identify and remain hidden
					in the raw area from where the kidney or uterus was removed
					or deep in the pelvis. Nurses can make a mistake in counting.
					If they insist that one sponge is missing, surgeons will look
					around in the abdomen a second time, but the unbelievable
					irony is that a sponge can still remain elusive. When one is
					racing against time, as described above, one may even take a
					third look but finally decide that a living problem is better than
					a dead certainty, thinking, "Let's send him out alive; we shall
					deal with the sponge if he survives." I doubt if anybody who
					has not gone through this experience will entirely believe me
					or agree with me when I say that the surgeon could not see
					the big sponge. What happens inside the operation theatre
					often seems to follow Murphy's law and ends in humiliation for
					surgeons for no fault of their own.
				</p>
				<p>
					One may argue that such a mishap can occur in desperate
					circumstances, but how can it be explained when the surgery is
					well planned and well organised? However, even in such "cold
					surgeries", unexpected situations such as sudden and torrential
					bleeding, which may become life-threatening, can develop.
					Even the anticipation of such a complication is likely to give rise
					to circumstances which result in this kind of lapse. Some years
					back, a very senior surgeon in one of the premier institutions
					was operating on a patient of idiopathic thrombocytopenic
					purpura to remove his spleen. The surgeon was keen not to
					waste even a second. The nurse was still organising her trolley
					of instruments when he extended his hand for the knife. When
					she took a second to hand it to him, he rebuked her sharply,
					"Stop decorating your trolley, sister; the patient is going to
					bleed." The spleen was taken out in the minimum possible time
					and the patient was promptly sewn up. A few days after the
					operation, an inexplicable swelling appeared in the patient's
					abdomen. When all investigations aimed at revealing its nature
					failed, the patient was opened up again. A sponge was found.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although it is invariably the surgeons who have to take the
					blame for an accident of this nature, there are factors beyond
					their control that can lead to it. I have discussed this particular
					form of "negligence" in some detail because lay people place it
					on top of the list of crimes that a surgeon can commit, though,
					apart from the fact that the unfortunate patient has to undergo
					another small operation for the removal of the left over object,
					it is uncommon and not as disastrous as many other acts of
					negligence. Nobody is ever willing to condone it; certainly not
					the judges. There is even a Supreme Court judgment which
					implies that if such a lapse is proved, no expert opinion need be
					produced by the complainant. To surgeons, it seems that these
					patients are being ungrateful after they (the surgeons) have done their best to bring them back from the brink of death. The
					colleagues of the surgeon can barely conceal their glee.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no way to ensure that this kind of accident does not
					take place. All surgical centres the world over already take
					every possible measure to minimise the occurrence of such
					mishaps. In other words, such accidents are like a time bomb
					ticking in some operation theatre or the other. If it happened
					with me, I would wish to be judged with a little sympathy and
					understanding. All I could say in my defence is that I am very
					sorry about it. These things happen.

				<h4>Saints with a past; sinners with a future</h4>
				<p>
					In 1997, a malpractice suit was filed against me by a patient
					for the first time. It came as a complete shock. The patient had
					successfully undergone major surgery and had then suffered
					a minor complication. Though I won the case, the intense
					outpouring of venom and bitterness by the patient in the
					courtroom left me completely baffled. I talked to many other
					doctors who had undergone experiences similar to mine. I
					then browsed through almost all the cases that had been
					reported from consumer courts across the country. I reached
					the following two conclusions.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The majority of cases of genuine medical negligence are
						directly attributable to a lack of professional knowledge
						on the part of the doctor treating the patient. The patient
						usually suffers grievously and sometimes even dies.
						Surprisingly, such negligence is mostly never noticed by
						anyone.
					</li>
					<li>
						On the other hand, most of the cases brought to the
						consumer courts are petty in nature. The patients in these
						cases have usually suffered a complication, or the benefits
						derived from the treatment (usually surgery) are below
						their expectations. They have invariably consulted another
						doctor, who has played a pivotal role in inciting the
						patient's ire.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Like all generalisations, the two mentioned above are also
					subject to exceptions, but on the whole, they hold water. To
					understand how this happens, we shall have to digress a little
					and see how doctors are trained.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were hardly any
					private hospitals in the country. Most consultants were
					attached to major medical institutions and all but very routine
					work was done in the hospitals attached to medical colleges.
					It was commonplace for a patient to travel 300-500 km for
					the treatment of a hernia. The consultants in these hospitals
					were generalists: a professor of surgery used to perform
					every surgery, be it abdominal, urological, cardiothoracic,
					neurological, orthopaedic, or plastic surgery. Teaching and
					training of medical students and doctors has never been
					methodical or professional, with a few exceptions here
					and there. Surgical "registrars" (present-day equivalent of
					senior residents), who used to be the de facto bosses of their
					units, were only at the threshold of their surgical career and
					their training was their own responsibility. There is a motto frequently quoted in surgical circles: "Watch one (operation), do
					one, teach one." In practice, this is never followed. Actually, it is
					more a matter of learning by trial and error. The surgical units
					of medical colleges used to be flooded with patients requiring
					major emergency surgery and it was the registrar who would
					take decisions regarding the need for surgery, and the timing
					and nature of the surgery. Taking these decisions was, again,
					the registrar's own responsibility. As a result, the morbidity and
					mortality rate was disturbingly high, but it used to get diluted
					due to the large number of patients. The professor used to
					perform only cold, elective surgeries, such as the removal of the
					gall bladder or kidney stones. While the professors performed
					operations, the assisting registrars learned only by watching,
					and their role was strictly limited to mopping up the blood to
					keep the operative field clean. Asking a question during surgery
					was a gross misdemeanour. To confront professors with a book
					which said something contrary to their opinion on a particular
					subject was an act of blasphemy. As the registrar moved up
					the ladder, he gradually honed his fingers and his knowledge,
					became more and more stubborn about the things he did not
					know and finally, became a professor with 20 years' experience
					(of making the same mistake every time) behind him. He had
					arrived. On his arrival, however, the new professor suffered from
					two major handicaps: (i) since he was supposed to be good at
					everything, he was just about average at most things and less
					than that at many others; and (ii) since his training had been, by
					and large, his own responsibility, he had no peers to look up to.
					This was a perfect setting for disasters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some years ago, a junior resident was on duty in the
					emergency unit of a medical college when a young man was
					admitted following a head injury. After some time, the resident
					noticed that the patient had become unconscious and there
					were other signs of intracranial haemorrhage. A burr hole had
					to be made in the skull urgently; otherwise, the patient would
					die within minutes. The house surgeon rushed to the registrar,
					who was sleeping in his room, and told him about the situation.
					The registrar did not even bother to come down and see the
					patient. He told the house surgeon, "Go down and keep quiet.
					We don't do burr holes. Our boss has never done one." The
					patient died within half an hour. His parents quietly picked up
					the dead body and left.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would consider this a typical example of sheer medical
					negligence. Making a burr hole is an extremely simple operation
					and can usually be carried out under local anaesthesia. Such
					situations are so desperate that they need to be handled
					promptly. There have been numerous cases in which the
					operation has been performed at the patient's bedside with
					unsterile equipment and with successful results. One does not
					need to be a neurosurgeon to do it; it is within the capabilities
					of every surgeon. Yet just because this gentleman (the registrar)
					had never seen his boss performing the operation, he did not
					know how to do it and the patient paid with his life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The manner in which a registrar reached the peak to become a
					professor - just by standing in a queue and not doing anything
					after three years of registrar ship - led to a kind of apathy and sloth which discouraged any initiative to improve upon the
					prevailing treatment practices. A middle-aged woman who
					was suffering from jaundice due to stones in the gall bladder
					and common bile duct (CBD) underwent surgery in a premiere
					institution. The two senior most surgeons operated on her,
					removing her gall bladder and the stones from the CBD. After
					the operation, her jaundice continued to worsen. The X-rays
					showed that all the stones had not been removed from the
					CBD. She was operated upon again and eight more stones
					were removed. She nearly died from the trauma of the two
					operations. However, her troubles were not over yet. Some 15
					years later, she developed jaundice again. She was operated
					upon and two stones were found in the CBD. Two weeks after
					the surgery, X-rays revealed two more stones had been left
					inside the CBD.
				</p>
				<p>
					This kind of mishap should not occur. The remedy is very
					simple: all the surgeon need do is to take an X-ray on the
					operation table. This does not involve any additional surgery
					and takes only five extra minutes. It would cost the patient Rs
					300, but save him or her an additional major surgery. Yet the
					story is repeated day after day, and the surgeons' apathy is
					inexplicable. As I said, genuine negligence is never discovered.
				</p>
				<p>
					I could go on with examples of this nature. These clearly
					illustrate the first part of my thesis which argues that genuine
					medical negligence is the result of ignorance of the subject
					and technique on the part of the surgeon. It escapes notice
					because it is very difficult to prove. If a patient with a head
					injury dies following surgery, negligence may be suspected,
					but if no surgery is performed, how can anyone prove that
					surgery was needed or feasible in the first place? Therefore,
					it is safer to do nothing. In the words of AH Clough, "Action is
					dangerous." Unfortunately, what is safe for the surgeon can be
					fatal for the patient. The term "trial and error" has been replaced
					by the new dignified "learning curve", which means that it takes
					time to learn a procedure and with the passage of time, the
					surgeon becomes better. Complications are swept under the
					carpet in the name of the learning curve. What is not stressed is
					that during the steep slope of the learning curve, the surgeon
					should work only under the supervision of a fully competent
					senior colleague. Dr JP Mitchell, a world-famous figure in
					urology, has said that a surgeon cannot be considered adept at
					performing a transurethral resection of the prostate unless he
					has performed a hundred under supervision. No urologist can
					claim to have had this kind of training.
				</p>
				<p>
					In contrast to cases of this serious and genuine kind of
					negligence, which almost always go unnoticed, the cases
					that go to the consumer courts are trifles. It would seem
					heartless and cruel to call a case a trifle if a patient has died
					due to alleged medical negligence, but the fact is that even in
					most of the cases of death, genuine negligence plays hardly
					any role. More often than not, death occurs due to a natural
					complication (cardiac arrest under anaesthesia) or the natural
					outcome of the disease (cardiac arrest following a heart attack).
					However, if the doctor or hospital staff have not seemed too
					prompt or concerned, the patient's attendants interpret the situation as one caused by negligence or deficiency in service,
					and sue the doctor and the hospital. Most of the cases, or at
					least the key issues involved, are outright frivolous. However, the
					lawyers, with their dilatory acumen, bring in so many additional
					accusations - the doctor did not answer the telephone call; the
					hospital was not clean; this or that investigation or test was not
					done and so on - that the real issue is lost in the confusion. This
					may sound too simplistic an example, but most of the cases
					brought to the consumer courts fall in this category. Apart from
					causing endless harassment to the doctor concerned, these
					cases do not achieve any worthwhile goal.
				</p>
				<p>
					I strongly feel that doctors need to look into their own
					backyards and put their own houses in order. Yesterday's
					saints are safe with their past, but today's sinners will have
					a difficult future if urgent remedial measures are not taken.
					These are not difficult and good results are not unattainable.
					The first step in problem-solving is the identification of the
					problem. If the causes of genuine medical negligence are
					identified correctly by the medical profession, the solutions
					will be easy to find. It is as imperative and urgent to find these
					solutions as a cure for AIDS.
				</p>

				<h4>Thou shall not judge</h4>
				<p>
					The medical profession was brought under the purview of
					the Consumer Protection Act with the apparent purpose
					of providing speedy redressal of the grievances of ordinary
					patients. The medical community felt it was unjustified and
					unwarranted, and a discriminatory move that allowed others
					to poke their noses into their profession. It was up in arms
					against the Act and when neither the politicians, nor the
					judiciary listened, it ultimately resigned itself to it sullenly.
					The public treated the Act as something of a windfall and
					made a beeline to the consumer courts. At this point in time,
					the only people who seem to have benefited from the whole
					exercise are a few judges, a lot of lawyers and all insurance
					companies. Unwittingly, the patient is still at the losing end.
					In fact, his candle burns at both ends now: medical care is
					no better than before; it is only more expensive. The lawyers
					have obviously benefited from a legislation that brings them
					a lot more business. One look at the immense volume of
					advertisements on the Internet for legal services for medical
					malpractice will make you wonder if there is any doctor who
					is not negligent. The insurance companies have benefited
					likewise. All doctors have to buy a personal indemnity policy
					now and the insurance premiums have suddenly gone up.
					These will regularly rise further.
				</p>
				<p>
					If any genuine benefit was to be expected from this legislation,
					it should have been that deterred by the exemplary
					punishment slapped by the court on some doctors, the rest of
					the errant lot would mend their ways, becoming more caring
					and less negligent. On the other hand, the mud-slinging
					has pushed the plunging image of the medical profession
					further downwards and has embittered the doctor-patient
					relationship. It is also proving counterproductive as far as
					medical expenses are concerned. As soon as a minor or major complication sets in, the doctor begins looking upon the
					patient as a potential litigant and starts taking precautionary
					measures, which would sound good in a court but may be
					of only arguable benefit to the patient. For example, at the
					slightest indication of infection setting in after an operation,
					the doctor prescribes the most exotic and expensive antibiotic,
					which may be only marginally more effective than one that is a
					lot less expensive. A host of blood tests and scans are ordered
					routinely. One obvious reason is that the doctor does not want
					to be confronted by a lawyer in the courtroom and asked a
					pointless question such as, "Do you mean to tell me, doctor, that
					you did not get my client's uranium levels in the blood tested?"
					The lies that patients concoct are original and creative; the
					way doctors manipulate the records would put the best card
					sharpers in Las Vegas to shame. Both things are done under the
					able guidance of the respective lawyers. Why can the judges
					not see through the whole charade?
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason is that the lawyer is as ignorant as a babe in the
					woods about matters which are of a highly technical nature. It
					is unfair to expect one professional (say, a doctor) to comment
					on the work of another professional (say, an engineer). In fact,
					an expert and unbiased professional alone can judge the work
					of a colleague with some degree of objectivity. Neurosurgeons
					watching urologists at work cannot say whether the latter are
					doing a good job or a bad one. At best, they can make only
					a vague assessment on the basis of the movements of the
					operating surgeon's hands or the amount of blood spilt.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even if we accept that judges do not reach any verdict when
					a matter of technicality is involved and seek expert opinion in
					such cases, the fact remains that they are not competent to
					adjudicate on matters of a broad general nature either. One
					form of medical negligence to which patients, lawyers and
					judges react with a knee-jerk reflex is that of delay in providing
					treatment to a patient. The majority of cases of medical
					negligence in the consumer courts revolve around establishing
					that the patient was not given prompt treatment, as a result of
					which he suffered grievous injury. Who is to define "reasonable"
					delay? Certainly not the litigant. One may, therefore, justifiably
					ask if a judge can define what constitutes delay in a given
					medical case.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think not. If a nurse pages a doctor to inform him/her that one
					of his/her patients has suffered cardiac arrest and the doctor
					takes just five minutes to arrive (maybe to finish his/her coffee),
					he/she is too late. Promptness here would mean that the
					doctor has to be on the scene instantly. Since this is practically
					impossible, every person, be it a resident doctor, nurse or
					laboratory technician, has to be adept at providing immediate
					treatment until the right person arrives. Any hospital that
					employs staff members incapable of providing this service
					is negligent in terms of maintaining a proper set-up. This will
					disqualify virtually all hospitals. However, the point I wish to
					make is that in this situation, a seemingly prompt response
					("the doctor was there within five minutes") is anything but
					prompt. On the other hand, there may be a patient who has
					been hospitalised with a small kidney stone and the doctor in charge may get a call from the resident doctor late at night,
					saying that the patient has severe pain. The consultant would
					probably tell the resident doctor to give the patient another
					dose of the painkiller injection. The next morning, when the
					doctor visits the patient and asks him/her how he/she is
					feeling, the likely answer is, "Fine. When can I go home?" A delay
					of more than 12 hours in visiting the patient is no delay in this
					case.
				</p>
				<p>
					These two may seem to be oversimplified and extreme
					examples, but they underscore the point that a layman, whether
					he is a litigant patient or a judge, is really not competent to
					decide if there was a delay in providing treatment to the
					patient. A lot of complications and even fatalities that can
					occur as the natural outcome of the disease process can easily
					be paraded as the result of an alleged delay by crafty lawyers,
					whose version is accepted by the unwitting judge. In a recent
					case, it was held by a court that "though there is no evidence
					(in this case) to show that the treatment would have saved the
					patient, yet the fact remains that there was delay in providing
					the same and, therefore, the hospital is guilty of negligence."
				</p>
				<p>
					In a case that came before an English court, Lord Denning,
					the presiding judge, told the jury, "Every surgical operation
					involves risks. It would be wrong and, indeed, bad law to say
					that simply because a misadventure or mishap occurred, the
					hospital and doctors are thereby liable. It would be disastrous
					to the community if it were so. It would mean that a doctor examining a patient or a surgeon operating at a table, instead
					of getting on with his work, would be forever looking over his
					shoulder to see if someone was coming up with a dagger - for
					an action for a negligence against a doctor is for him like unto a
					dagger. His professional reputation is as dear to him as his body,
					perhaps more so, and an action for negligence can wound
					his reputation as severely as a dagger can his body. You must
					not, therefore, find him negligent simply because something
					happens to go wrong." (Hatcher v Black. The Times. 1954; Jul 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					We are only on the threshold of a hell that threatens to
					break loose if matters are not tackled dispassionately and
					objectively. If the situation in the USA is any pointer, listen to
					Lord Denning again, "Medical malpractice suits there (in the
					USA) have become the curse of the medical profession. The
					legal profession gets 'contingency fees'. So they take up cases
					on speculation. The jury gives enormous damages. Insurance
					premiums are high. The doctors charge large fees to cover
					them. All this is very worrying." I am not arguing that the
					medical profession should be taken out of the ambit of the
					Consumer Protection Act or that every other profession should
					be brought under its purview for the cause of fair play and nondiscrimination.
					However, people who matter should probably
					realise that it is time to review whether the legislation is doing
					any good to the people for whose benefit it was intended.
