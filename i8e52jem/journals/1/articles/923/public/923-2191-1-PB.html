  <h4>Practical issues in implementation of WMA's draft
    Declaration of Helsinki</h4>
  <p>The working group of the World Medical Association
    (WMA) has published a revised draft of the Declaration of
    Helsinki for public consultation till June 15, 2013 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects [Internet]. Annotated version. Available from: http://www.wma.net/en/20activities/10eth ics/10helsinki/15publicconsult/DoH-draft-for-public-consultation_ annotated.pdf" id="1">(1)</a>. There
    are many positive changes in the document with respect to
    compensation, education of investigators, informed consent in
    the case of stored samples, etc. The changes represent a step
    forward for ethics. However, there may be certain points of
    concern regarding the implementation of the Declaration.</p>
  <p>Point 20 of the document <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects [Internet]. Annotated version. Available from: http://www.wma.net/en/20activities/10eth ics/10helsinki/15publicconsult/DoH-draft-for-public-consultation_ annotated.pdf" id="1">(1)</a> states that medical research
    involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or
    community is justified only if it is responsive to the health needs
    and priorities of this population or community and <em>the research
    cannot be carried out among a non-vulnerable population.</em> Will
    this additional clause be harmful to vulnerable populations?
    Researchers may use it to conduct research among vulnerable
    people. This was prohibited earlier, the provision being that
    to begin with, many new markers had to be tried among the
    general population before conducting the study, depending on
    its merit, among a vulnerable population. With the addition of
    this clause, the same new markers can be tried simultaneously
    on the general and vulnerable populations. The same can be
    applied to drug trials. Point 20 also states that consideration
    should be given to ensuring that the <em>community receives a fair
    level of additional benefits.</em> How is it possible to measure this?
    Also, what is the meaning of "fair level"?</p>
  <p>A component of point 22 states that the protocol must describe
    the arrangements for post-study access by the study subjects
    to interventions identified as beneficial in the study. Though
    this is very important ethically, there is a need to consider
    how far it is practicable. After a clinical trial has concluded,
    it takes from a few days to a few months to assess and reach
    conclusions about the beneficial effects, and it may take some
    time to obtain the Drugs Controller General's approval for
    marketing the drug. Is it possible for a company/ institutional
    ethics committee (IEC)/investigator/study participant to give
    consent for a drug, for which the analysis of the efficacy is being
    worked out? The participants thus have to revert to the drugs
    or measures they were taking earlier till the Drug Controller
    General grants approval. The word "arrangement" may refer to
    subsidised drugs or free drugs. Would this assurance of free
    drugs act as an inducement to participate in trials, especially
    those involving cancer and end-stage disease? A component
    of point 32, on the subject of informed consent, states that
    an IEC should decide on the impracticability of obtaining
    informed consent in the case of stored samples. As all IECs
    are independent, there will be various opinions on the matter.</p>
  <p>Further, how can impracticability be decided upon? Is the
    difficulty in obtaining informed consent due to a large number
    of samples, the fact that they have come from different parts
    of the country, or the fact that they are taken anonymously?
    Are we going to permit telephonic or verbal consent if these
    participants are unable to come to the centre personally? Point
    33 of the draft, which deals with placebo, permits their use "for
    compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons...".
    This needs to be deleted altogether. Again, it is difficult for an
    IEC to determine what "compelling and scientifically sound
    methodological reasons" are. The same may be true of point
    37, which pertains to unproven interventions. The proposed
    provision opens a Pandora's box in the area of stem cell studies
    and other studies on genetically engineered techniques.
    Though the draft is a reform measure aimed at promoting
    ethical research, it would be useful if an appendix were added
    to describe the practical aspects of its implementation.</p>
