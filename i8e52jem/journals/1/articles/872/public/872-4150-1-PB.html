					Medical students and  interns in Tamil Nadu were on strike for a month since April 22, 2003. The main  reason was the present government's move to permit more private medical  colleges in the state. The strike was called off on May 22, without the  government conceding this main demand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other grievances were  against the proposal to increase fees and reduce the stipend paid to interns  and postgraduates. Several rounds of talks between the government and students'  representatives have proved fruitless because the government is unwilling to  give an assurance that no new private medical colleges will be permitted. On  May 3, the minister for health stated that the government could not give such  an assurance since the Medical Council of India could sanction them and the managements  would approach the court. However, the students point out that, without the  government's connivance, it is difficult to start a medical college as numerous  sanctions (for land, building, etc.) have to be obtained.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Tamil Nadu Medical  Practitioners Association, a body of doctors in private practice, has supported  the move to open private medical colleges. Its press statement claimed that  Tamil Nadu had only half the number of doctors required. Contrary to this,  students claim that there is one doctor for every 500 people in the state as  against the World Health Organization's recommendation for 1:1,250. The Indian  Medical Association has said that no more private colleges are required, but  the existing ones may be allowed to increase their intake of students.
				</p>

					Since 1992, when the  World Bank published its recommendations for the health sector in developing  countries, successive governments have tried to implement its suggestions.  Significantly, these include privatisation of medical education and fee hikes.  The government's strategy has been to implement the recommendations piecemeal  without announcing any change in policy. Thus, user fees was introduced for  computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. There  is currently a move to introduce an outpatient fee.
				</p>
				<p>
					Simultaneously, the  range and quality of services in government hospitals have deteriorated. Here  too, the strategy has been to not announce any policy change. Thus, even though  any service including expensive surgery is available in public hospitals on  paper, in reality such services are not available due to lack of essential  supplies and well-trained staff. Quite often, a department is created merely to  accommodate an influential doctor. Without the finances to afford private care,  many people die of curable ailments.&nbsp; Others suffer avoidable morbidity.  Every doctor who has worked in a public hospital has seen patients like a young  man with his leg rotting due to diabetic gangrene simply because he could not  afford insulin.
				</p>
				<p>
					No government has the  interest to strengthen the healthcare system. Only the bare minimum, necessary  to provide the fa√ßade of a caring government, is available. Other facilities  are made available on whim; there is no planned development. The very fact that  one group of doctors claim that the state requires double the number of medical  practitioners while another claims that there are already too many,  demonstrates the poor state of knowledge and statistics regarding the health  sector. In a caring society, one would expect the government to keep itself and  its citizens well-informed and take steps to ensure a steady supply of medical  practitioners in all parts of the state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, everywhere in  the world there are places where doctors are reluctant to go, and incentives  have to be given. However, the claim that the private colleges will provide  doctors for rural areas rings thin. If the aim is to push the doctors out of cities  by oversupply, the experience in engineering should provide a cautionary tale.  The state is now flooded with engineers from 256 colleges producing about  78,000 engineers every year. Those from the top colleges (almost all run by the  government) are able to land reasonably good jobs. The vast majority is doing  the work earlier done by diploma holders. A large number are unemployed. This  year, some 50 colleges are reportedly for sale.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, existing  government medical colleges are running steadily downhill. The once proud  buildings housing the basic science departments, the foundation of any college,  are in a pathetic state. It looks like the government would do to medical  colleges what it has already done to hospitals-make them poor cousins of the  private sector. If this happens, it will be a sad day for the state.</p>
