					The Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF (hereafter Xpert) is a recent technology  that has "demonstrated sensitive detection of  tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance directly from untreated sputum in  less than two hours" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh JA, Bhan A, Upshur R. Diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and provision of second-line TB treatment in India: some ethical considerations. Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Apr-Jun; 10(2):110-14." id="1">(1)</a>. Many  are in favour of the widespread implementation of this technology in  India. In a recent article in the <em>IJME</em>,  Singh, Bhan and Upshur state that "India is ethically obliged to phase in the  nationwide deployment of Xpert...as soon as reasonably possible" and "is  ethically obliged to provide those diagnosed with first-line drug resistance  universal access to second-line TB drugs" to treat multiple drug-resistant  tuberculosis (MDR-TB) <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh JA, Bhan A, Upshur R. Diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and provision of second-line TB treatment in India: some ethical considerations. Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Apr-Jun; 10(2):110-14." id="1">(1)</a>.

					The prevalence of MDR-TB in India is estimated to be about  2%. In their review of the Xpert technology, A Trebucq and colleagues make the  point that the question is not whether to treat MDR-TB, but rather, when, where  and how to treat it <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tr&eacute;bucq A, Enarson DA, Chiang CY,Van Deun A, Harries AD, Boillot F, Detjen A, Fujiwara PI, Graham SM, Monedero I, Rusen ID, Rieder HL. Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF for national tuberculosis programmes in low-income countries: when, where and how? Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 2011 Dec;15(12):1567&ndash;72. doi:10.5588/ijtld.11.0392 Epub 2011 Oct 13." id="2">(2)</a>. Besides the limitations related to cost (~$10 per  test), the environment required (the need for a stable, regular electric supply  for an air conditioner to be able to maintain the room temperature at 15&ndash;30  &deg;C), the shelf life of the test cartridges (18 months), and supply and  maintenance issues, there are other questions as well regarding the reliability  of the test at different levels of prevalence of MDR-TB. When the prevalence is  1% or less, the positive predictive value (ppv) is 32%; when the prevalence is  2%, the ppv is 49%; and when the prevalence is greater than 15%, the ppv is  above 90%. Any specimen testing positive for rifampicin resistance in a  low-prevalence area will have to be verified by culture and antibiotic testing.

					To control clinical TB and reduce the rate of infection, a  well-run national TB programme must be in place <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Tr&eacute;bucq A, Enarson DA, Chiang CY,Van Deun A, Harries AD, Boillot F, Detjen A, Fujiwara PI, Graham SM, Monedero I, Rusen ID, Rieder HL. Xpert&reg; MTB/RIF for national tuberculosis programmes in low-income countries: when, where and how? Int J Tuberc Lung Dis. 2011 Dec;15(12):1567&ndash;72. doi:10.5588/ijtld.11.0392 Epub 2011 Oct 13." id="2">(2)</a>. This translates into the  following: 70% of cases must be identified and 85% of sputum-positive cases  should be treated successfully with Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course  (DOTS). Second-line drugs (SLDs) used to treat MDR-TB cost at least 100&ndash;200  times more than those used in a standard DOTS programme. The patient must take  the SLDs for 18&ndash;24 months and usually has to spend the first six months in  hospital. The success rate is about 60%. In general, DOTS requires six months of treatment with no  hospitalisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scaling up treatment of MDR-TB poses its own special  problems. At the moment, SLDs are not  being produced in adequate amounts and the prices of these drugs have been  increasing year by year. Some who advocate the widespread treatment of MDR-TB  cite the example of HIV/AIDS, for which the initial cost of treatment was high  and prices were slashed subsequently, following intensive lobbying. However, MDR-TB is much less common than  HIV/AIDS (though the number of patients is growing), there has been much less  advocacy for widespread treatment of cases, and there has been a significant  delay in the development of effective SLDs. Singh et al note that South Africa  has rolled out the treatment of MDR-TB nationally, even though it may not be  affordable, and say India could do the same <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh JA, Bhan A, Upshur R. Diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and provision of second-line TB treatment in India: some ethical considerations. Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Apr-Jun; 10(2):110-14." id="1">(1)</a>. South Africa has a purchasing power parity  per capita that is three times that of India: $11,375 vs $3830 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Monetary Fund. World Economic Outlook Database, April 2013 [Internet] [cited 2013 Aug 28]. Available from: www.imf.org/.../weoreptc.aspx?" id="3">(3)</a>, and has a  much more developed and efficient healthcare delivery system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why is the incidence of  MDR-TB increasing? A high dropout rate from DOTS programmes, limited follow-up  of patients on therapy, inappropriate and incomplete treatment regimens  (especially in the private sector), and counterfeit drugs have all contributed  to the rise in incidence. Without an excellent DOTS programme at the point of  care, backed by a multi-drug resistance treatment programme which has trained  staff, adequate drugs in stock and a laboratory capable of carrying out  cultures for drug resistance, testing for MDR-TB will present an ethical  dilemma for the caregiver, since up to 10% of those who test positive for drug  resistance will respond to first-line drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two other issues raised by Singh et al deserve comment. The  authors state that the government is ethically bound to continue administering  SLDs once the treatment has been started in the private sector. This makes  sense if the original diagnosis is confirmed. If a few days of inappropriate  treatment for MDR-TB are extended for another two years, it could place the  patient at great inconvenience and risk. This would also be at a high cost to  society. According to the definition of autonomy, a patient has a right to  choose among treatment options <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singh JA, Bhan A, Upshur R. Diagnosis of drug-resistant TB and provision of second-line TB treatment in India: some ethical considerations. Indian J Med Ethics. 2013 Apr-Jun; 10(2):110-14." id="1">(1)</a>. However, what if the patient chooses not to be treated? Does the public have a right not to be  exposed to a disease that is spread by air &ndash; a common public good?
				</p>
				<p>
					In reviewing the when, where and how to use  Xpert, India would be well advised to move cautiously in rolling out this  technology to diagnose rifampicin resistance. The use of Xpert should be  restricted to those centres where a positive test can be confirmed in the  laboratory, and where complete uninterrupted treatment can be assured. Without  this basic infrastructure, the widespread use of Xpert could lead to  over-diagnosis and inadequate treatment, which could lead to more cases of  XDR-TB, an essentially untreatable disease within the Indian context. When it  comes to the community, the most effective intervention and the most ethical  approach would be for the country to continue to improve its DOTS programme to  ensure effective treatment to the vast majority of TB patients, as this itself  will reduce the incidence of MDR-TB. Technology does have its limits.
