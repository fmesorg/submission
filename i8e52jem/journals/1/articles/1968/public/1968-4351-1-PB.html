				<h4>Issues in Medical Ethics (4)</h4>
				<p>
					The journal appears good and most of the cartoons are wonderful. Keep it up. Recently the Tamil Nadu government enacted a legislation to regulate the the mushrooming private hospitals and clinics which are run at substandard levels by any standard, and basic ethics are thrown to the wind. Now the IMA and Dental Associations are up against this legislation.

				<p>
					I wish someone mkes a study of it and writes an article in the journal.
