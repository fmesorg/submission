				<h4>FMES activities: some highlights</h4>
				<p>
					In January, some of us  attended a workshop at the Sri Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and  Technology, on research ethics in South Asia. Over five days, a variety of  subjects related to research ethics were covered through lectures and case  study discussions. Discussions were lively, reflecting the level of interest in  the subject for a small but signficant group of professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this meeting we also  made contact with doctors at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, who are  actively involved in running a number of ethics-related programmes in the  hospital. In July one of us attended a workshop in Karachi on research ethics.  The visit was an eye-opener in terms of the extent of discussion on ethics  within Aga Khan University. It was also a wonderful experience to be welcomed  with such overwhelming hospitality. There are so many strong bonds between the  two countries. As a result of these two meetings, we hope to develop a  sustained dialogue on medical ethics in South Asia.

					On July 1, we  participated in a workshop where representatives of the government, medical  associations, consumer groups, insurance companies and health activists  discussed proposed amendments to the Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act,  1949, one of the oldest Acts to regulate nursing homes. The revised Act, to be  called the Maharashtra Clinical Establishments Act, will cover all private and  public hospitals, diagnostic centres, laboratories and medical practitioners of  all systems, in the state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Members also helped  organise and speak at two workshops, and came to recognise how effective these  programmes are to reach out to the medical community. A two-day workshop under  the auspices of the Academy for Medical Sciences in Nagpur, was received with  enthusiasm by participants. A one-day workshop for students of the health  and development course at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences was equally lively,  with heated discussions. Doctors and students were willing to give up  their Sundays to sit through lectures on ethics. We hope to hold more such  programmes in the future.

				<p>
					Finally, the latest on  the labour of love: a CD ROM with eight volumes of Issues in Medical Ethics is  available at an introductory price of Rs 300 - a steal, considering the amount  of valuable information and comment from eight years of the journal. You can  send your money order or cheque (with appropriate additions for out-station  cheques) to our office for a copy of the CD. You can also look at the  journal at www.medicalethicsindia.org.
