				<h4>Blood collection in medical practice</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Blood collection in medical practice, blood suckers many.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>From mammals: Draculas in folklore, vampires or leeches attack at  times, even mosquitoes.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>There are in reality always medical vampires: students,  researchers and doctors from our fellow humans, under the banner of therapy or  diagnosis.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Blood letting, known before Hippocrates as removal of harmful  tumours. Also believed in letting of demons, existed in some countries and</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>communities for the wrong reasons and without benefits. Medical  history has many such stories.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Blood collection for medical practice: each doctor while on  service after a clinical assessment of the patient, recommends blood tests</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>With or without reason, regularly and repeatedly or at intervals.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Blood collection for evaluation, very often and more, in intensive  care wards in teaching institutions.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>The ill effects on patients: anaemia and</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>infection influenced by the duration of hospitalisation.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Multiple pricks for blood collection are made to confirm illness  or to make</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>a diagnosis, and to assess the status and progress.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>But every now and then through different sites. Is this not an  international</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>harm or an avoidable charm?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Blood collection practices need revision in all aspects:</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Replacement of old methods, use of multichannel analysers</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>and small capillary samples.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Refrain from indiscriminate orders</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>And plan for a collection in appropriate tubes.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Oh, my dear vampires, assess in every case, the cumulative blood  loss.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>And decide this before an order, never, never routine ones.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Welcome research or thesis works, but all after discussion and  rounds.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Blood collection is always more in multispeciality care.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Finalise the order after negotiation with the co- ordinator and  take care in flushing lines to overcome blood loss.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Oh, my medical vampires, recall the quantity of blood loss per day</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>It seems to be litres in hospitals.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Patients lose more but receive less. Is it justifiable or  warranted?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Let us be humane and judicious.</em>
