                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been linked to a number of serious adverse reactions. The range of symptoms is diverse and they develop in a multi-layered manner over an extended period of time. The argument for the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine overlooks the following flaws: (i) no consideration is given to the genetic basis of autoimmune diseases, and arguments that do not take this into account cannot assure the safety of the vaccine; (ii) the immune evasion mechanisms of HPV, which require the HPV vaccine to maintain an extraordinarily high antibody level for a long period of time for it to be effective, are disregarded; and (iii) the limitations of effectiveness of the vaccine. We also discuss various issues that came up in the course of developing, promoting and distributing the vaccine, as well as the pitfalls encountered in monitoring adverse events and epidemiological verification.</p>

                  <li><strong>Overview of the HPV vaccine issue in Japan</strong></li>
                  <p>HPV vaccines were approved later in Japan than in the western countries (October 2009 for Cervarix, and July 2011 for Gardasil). The vaccination rate was initially low. However, after a campaign for the promotion of the vaccine, which led to government subsidisation of the cost of the vaccine in November 2010, the vaccination rate increased exponentially. This was followed by an unexpected increase in reports of adverse events (AEs). Importantly, these vaccines gave rise to a large number of serious AEs. Table 1 shows the number of reports of serious AEs/adverse drug reactions (ADRs), defined according to the ICH E2A guidelines (<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.

                  <p>Other key features of the ADRs reported with HPV vaccines are the diversity of the symptoms and their development in a multi-layered manner over an extended period of time. The ADRs include complex, multi-system symptoms, such as seizures; disturbance of consciousness; systemic pain, including headache, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain and other pain; motor dysfunction, such as paralysis, muscular weakness, exhaustion and involuntary movements; numbness and sensory disturbances; autonomic symptoms, including dizziness, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea; respiratory dysfunction, including dyspnoea and asthma; endocrine disorders, such as menstrual disorder and hypermenorrhoea; hypersensitivity to light and sound; psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, frustration, hallucinations and overeating; higher brain dysfunction and cognitive impairments, including memory impairment, disorientation and loss of concentration; and sleep disorders, including hypersomnia and sudden sleep attacks. In some cases, these symptoms impair learning and result in extreme fatigue and decreased motivation, having a negative impact on everyday life (<a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kinoshita T, Abe RT, Hineno A, Tsunekawa K, Nakane S, Ikeda S.

                  <p>The reason why HPV vaccines cause these characteristic adverse effects remains to be studied in the future, but one of the most plausible explanations is that these vaccines are designed to maintain an extremely high antibody titre over a long period of time. Since prolonged inflammatory reactions associated with infection are known to cause autoimmune diseases and worsening of autoimmune reactions (<a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sfriso P, Ghirardello A, Botsios C, Tonon M, Zen M, Bassi N, Bassetto F, Doria A.Infections and autoimmunity: the multifaceted relationship.

Epub 2009 Dec 16." id="14">14</a>), longtime antigen stimulation with HPV vaccines might also induce complex autoimmune reactions via a mechanism similar to that seen with prolonged infection.</p>
                  <p>Individuals who experienced ADRs following HPV vaccination established a voluntary liaison organisation to facilitate communication with others who also experienced ADRs in Japan. When these ADRs were reported in the mass media, HPV vaccination became a major social issue. In response to the negative press surrounding HPV vaccination, the MHLW withdrew its active recommendation in June 2013 on the grounds of "an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination" (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Notification from MHLW on routine vaccination programme of HPV vaccine 2013.6.14 [Japanese] [cited 2017 Mar 25]. Available from: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/shingi2/0000091963.html" id="1">1</a>). As a result, the inoculation rate for the vaccine decreased rapidly [from 80% at its peak to less than 1% at present (<a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Immunization coverage rates in Japan [cited 2017 Mar 25]. Available from: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/bcg/other/5.html" id="15">15</a>)]. In response to this change, proponents of the HPV vaccine initiated a push-back campaign and began actively lobbying the government.</p>
                  <p>On January 20, 2014, the expert advisory committee established by the MHLW (<a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Conference Minutes of Council of Health Sciences, subcommittee of vaccination, ADR Working group meeting, January 20, 2014 [Japanese] [cited 2017 Mar 25]. Available from: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/shingi2/0000091998.html" id="16">16</a>) presented the view that the diverse pain and motor dysfunctions experienced by many individuals after HPV vaccination comprised psychosomatic reactions to anxiety or stimulatory pain caused by needle injection, and were not due to any components of the vaccine itself. However, doctors and researchers who examined patients with post-vaccination symptoms arrived at a completely different conclusion, highlighting both the characteristic symptoms and course, which are difficult to explain as psychosomatic reactions (<a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Yokota S, Kuroiwa Y, Nakamura I, Nakajima T, Nishioka K.

                  <p>Thus, the safety of the HPV vaccine remains far from certain in Japan, justifying the public's strong distrust. Recognising the potentially negative influence of these events on public opinion in other countries, pharmaceutical companies initiated a counter-intervention strategy through public and private organisations, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), one of the WHO's advisory committees, claimed it had "not found any safety issue that would alter its recommendations for the use of the vaccine" and criticised the MHLW's decision to withdraw active recommendation (<a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Global advisory committee on vaccine safety: statement on safety of HPV-vaccines, December 17, 2015 [cited 2017 Mar 25].

                  <p>Despite these obstacles, in July 2016, a victims' group filed a multi-plaintiff lawsuit in the district courts of Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka against the Japanese government and the two pharmaceutical companies that had produced these vaccines. Furthermore, in December of the same year, additional victims joined the multi-plaintiff lawsuit, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to 119 (<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Plaintiffs Lawyers of HPV Vaccines Lawsuits [cited 2017 Mar 25].

                    <p>So far, we have reviewed the adverse reactions to HPV vaccines and the measures taken by the MHLW in Japan that provoked controversy both in Japan and abroad. In the next section, we discuss the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccines promoted by the WHO and other organisations, and identify a flaw in the basis of their arguments in favour of the vaccines.</p>

However, there are major problems with the expert committee's investigation (<a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Conference Minutes of Council of Health Sciences, subcommittee of vaccination, ADR Working group meeting, January 20, 2014 [Japanese] [cited 2017 Mar 25].

                        <p>The most serious problem is that very few members of the committee actually examined patients with post-vaccination symptoms. The committee's investigation focused exclusively on pain and motor dysfunction, and ignored many other diverse symptoms that have been observed. Further, cases in which adverse events occurred more than a month after vaccination were excluded from consideration on the ground that most adverse effects of vaccines occur within one month of vaccination.

                        <p>The methods used for determining psychosomatic reactions to be the cause of symptoms are also open to question (<a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Conference Minutes of Council of Health Sciences, subcommittee of vaccination, ADR Working group meeting, January 20, 2014 [Japanese] [cited 2017 Mar 25]. Available from: http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/shingi2/0000091998.html" id="16">16</a>). The expert advisory committee proposed four hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of post-vaccination symptoms: (i) neurological disorder, (ii) intoxication, (iii) immunological reaction, and (iv) psychosomatic reaction. Those cases which do not conform to the committee's criteria for (i)&ndash;(iii) were regarded as having no causal relationship with the HPV vaccine. However, since the definition of the psychosomatic response is ambiguous and the diagnosis is exclusively made by the subjective judgement of the doctor, many cases are diagnosed as psychosomatic reactions.</p>
                        <p>Support for the expert advisory committee's conclusion is far from universal.

                            <p>Among the pathophysiological mechanisms related to adverse reactions after vaccination, the involvement of autoimmunity is one of the most probable. The various mechanisms suggested with regard to autoimmune diseases include: molecular mimicry (<a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cusick MF, Libbey JE, Fujinam RS. Molecular Mimicry as a Mechanism of Autoimmune Disease.

The enemy within: endogenous retroelements and autoimmune disease. Nat Immunol. 2014;15(5):415-22." id="34">34</a>).</p>
                            <p>Although the aetiology has not been fully elucidated, most autoimmune diseases are complex polygenic conditions, in which the affected individual inherits multiple genetic polymorphisms that contribute to disease susceptibility, and these genes interact with environmental factors to cause the disease. It is a well-known fact that some human leucocyte antigen alleles occur at a higher frequency in patients with certain autoimmune diseases than in the general population (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyfive" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abbas AK, Lichtman AH, Pillai S.

                            <p>At present, what is claimed to be the primary evidence for the safety of the HPV vaccine is that there is no statistically significant difference in the incidence of autoimmune diseases among vaccinated females and unvaccinated females or the general population. However, since the proportion of genetically susceptible people in the general population is very small and limited, simple comparisons of the incidence of autoimmune diseases between those who have been vaccinated and a control (unvaccinated) group are likely to show no significant difference. Arguments that do not take this into account cannot assure the safety of the vaccine. The baseline prevalence of many autoimmune diseases is relatively low. Thus, careful large-scale post-marketing surveillance that takes into account the immunological characteristics of individual patients is required to scientifically verify the relationship between vaccination and autoimmune diseases (<a class="reference" href="#thirtysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Castiblanco J, Anaya JM.

                            <p>In drug regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry, all AEs in a patient's medical record are coded for computer processing and thus, details contained in the raw data are "lost".

                            <p>HPV is equipped with various immune evasion mechanisms, which could cause the immune system to become more tolerant to the infection, creating a microenvironment susceptible to further infection and facilitating the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). To counteract these immune evasion mechanisms, the HPV vaccine is designed to maintain an extraordinarily high level of antibodies for more than a decade (<a class="reference" href="#thirtynine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Einstein MH, Takacs P, Chatterjee A, Sperling RS, Chakhtoura N, Blatter MM, Lalezari J, David MP, Lin L, Struyf F, Dubin G; HPV-010 Study Group.Comparison of long-term immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine in healthy women aged 18-45 years: end-of-study analysis of a Phase III randomized trial.

                        <p>While the GACVS statement claims that "the impact of HPV vaccines on HPV-related clinical outcomes, including pre-cancerous lesions, is well established", in actuality, the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine is quite limited, as discussed below. </p>
                        <p>First, the only verified effect of the HPV vaccine is a preventive effect on pre-cancerous lesions (specifically CIN); the preventive effect on cervical cancer itself has not been established. The effects of the vaccines currently approved in Japan (Cervarix and Gardasil) on pre-cancerous lesions have been demonstrated only in the cases of HPV 16 and 18, which, according to the most reliable studies, represent only 50% of cervical cancer cases in Japan (<a class="reference" href="#fortyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Asato T, Maehama T, Nagai Y, Kanazawa K, Uezato H, Kariya K.

                        <p>Further, 10% or fewer cases of high-risk HPV infection result in persistent infection that can cause cancer, while the large majority of any pre-cancerous lesions (CIN) that do develop resolve before becoming cancerous (<a class="reference" href="#fortytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ho GY, Bierman R, Beardsley L, Chang CJ, Burk RD.

Even if cancer develops, regular check-ups can help to detect it at an early stage and appropriate treatment (surgery, radiation and drug therapy) saves many lives. On the basis of these facts, the promotion of educational activity that emphasises the importance of screening and early detection, as well as the creation of an environment in which women feel more comfortable undergoing Pap testing, would be far more effective at preventing cervical cancer than would pressuring teenage girls to receive the existing HPV vaccination, with all its problems.</p>
                        <p>The proponents of the HPV vaccines claim that they are 98% &ndash; 100% effective in preventing cervical cancer. In reality, however, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) provided by HPV vaccines is, at most, 0.1% &ndash; 0.7%, on the basis of calculations using the existing data (<a class="reference" href="#fortysix" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paavonen J, Naud P, Salmer&oacute;n J, Wheeler CM, Chow SN, Apter D, Kitchener H, Castellsague X, Teixeira JC, Skinner SR, Hedrick J, Jaisamrarn U, Limson G, Garland S, Szarewski A, Romanowski B, Aoki FY, Schwarz TF, Poppe WA, Bosch FX, Jenkins D, Hardt K, Zahaf T, Descamps D, Struyf F, Lehtinen M, Dubin G; HPV PATRICIA Study Group.

Further, this indicates only the reduction in the risk of developing pre-cancerous lesions, while the risk of developing cervical cancer remains unknown.</p>
                        <p>The promotion of screening for cervical cancer is another important measure against cervical cancer. For a long time now, attention has been drawn to the low screening rate for cervical cancer in Japan compared to the western countries. In particular, young women with no experience of pregnancy are reluctant to undergo gynaecological examinations in Japan. Access to examinations by female doctors and an acceptance of self-sampling would undoubtedly increase the screening rates. In fact, the promotion of screening for cervical cancer significantly reduced the age-adjusted incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the UK (<a class="reference" href="#fortyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Quinn M, Babb P, Jones J, Allen E.Effect of screening on incidence of and mortality from cancer of cervix in England: evaluation based on routinely collected statistics.

                  <p>In the previous sections, we discussed various issues regarding the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. It is now appropriate to ask how such questionable vaccines have come into widespread use. The answer, at least with respect to Japan, can be found in a structural flaw, combined specifically with the following factors: (i) aggressive promotion by the pharmaceutical industry, (ii) trade negotiations by economic superpowers, and (iii) contemporary medicine, which is characterised by overconfidence in technology and a lack of humility with respect to listening to patients' complaints.</p>

                        <h5><li>Medical professionals forgetting their role</li></h5>
                        <p>Basic defects inherent in the medical community underlie the issue of the HPV vaccine. In 2004, Sheldon Krimsky pointed out the increasing influence of commercialism in academic science and biomedical research in his book, <em>Science in the private interest</em> (<a class="reference" href="#fiftyseven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheldon Krimsky. Science in the private interest: has the lure of profits corrupted biomedical research? Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc; 2003, p4." id="57">57</a>). He wrote, "...the mix of science and commerce continues to erode the ethical standards of research and diminish public confidence in its results. "In the 13 years since the publication of the book, his warning has become a reality everywhere in the world, not only in the USA. Originally, public health and pharmaco-epidemiology were the scientific fields that aimed to protect the health of individual patients and the public. However, the current reality is very far from the ideal.</p>
                        <p>Science is now misused to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical industry, and has been used to deny the causal relationship between the drug and its adverse reactions. Many researchers and experts are attempting to exclude inconvenient truths from consideration. "The taxonomy of diseases represents the nearest science has got to nature, but it remains a theoretical construct. It is the theory that should be discounted when the patient's symptoms refuse to fit, not the patient's account of the reality of their experience." (<a class="reference" href="#fiftyeight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Heath I.Following the story:continuity of care in general practice.

Today's diagnostics and therapeutics were created by listening to patients' voices and conducting careful examinations. It is irresponsible to dismiss a patient's complaint as a psychogenic reaction or a general phenomenon among young women without conducting a thorough examination.</p>
                  </ol>
                    <li><strong>Considerations for solving problems</strong></li>
                    <p>As described in section III, the introduction of HPV vaccination in Japan was promoted with an emphasis on commercial interests rather than as a public health need. This situation is not unique to Japan and has also been observed in other countries. In Australia, for example, despite the considerable doubts of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee about the Gardasil vaccine, the committee's decision to reject the addition of Gardasil to the national vaccination schedule was hurriedly overturned, following political interference and lobbying by other vested interests (<a class="reference" href="#sixty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hart E. The history of questionable fast-tracked global HPV vaccination [cited 2017 Mar 25]. Available from: https://elizabethhart.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-history-of-questionable-fast-trackedglobal-hpv-vaccination.pdf" id="60">60</a>). In the USA, Merck & Co, Inc promoted legislation to mandate HPV vaccination for school attendance by serving as an information resource, lobbying legislators, drafting legislation, mobilising female legislators and physicians' organisations, conducting consumer marketing campaigns, and filling gaps in access to the vaccine. Legislators relied heavily on Merck for scientific information (<a class="reference" href="#sixtyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mello MM,Abiola S, Colgrove J. Pharmaceutical companies' role in state vaccination policymaking: the case of humanpapillomavirus vaccination. Am J Public Health. 2012 May;102(5):893-8. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300576. Epub 2012 Mar 15." id="61">61</a>).The responsibility to prove the efficacy and safety of a vaccine lies with the pharmaceutical companies, and the government is expected to monitor and guide these efforts. The current situation in which commercial interests drive government policy must be corrected from a medical ethics perspective. </p>
                    <p>At present, Japan is one of the few countries in which the active recommendation of HPV vaccination has been temporarily stopped; the regulatory authorities in other countries have not changed their policies. Although various groups of victims of vaccination have collaborated on wideranging activities in these countries, the regulatory authorities have not yet admitted the causal relationship between the vaccines and the victims' health injuries.</p>
                    <p>The Japanese government's decision to stop actively recommending HPV vaccination has, to an extent, encouraged regulators and patients in other countries to question the value of HPV vaccination. Japan's efforts to stop active recommendation might have been successful because of its historical background of cases of environmental pollution and drug-induced suffering (Minamata disease, thalidomide, SMON, dura mater graft-associated Creutzfeldt&ndash;Jakob disease, HIV transmitted by contaminated blood products, etc), which occurred during the post-war period of rapid economic growth. In the multi-plaintiff suits that followed the instances of environmental pollution and drug-induced suffering, the plaintiff groups sought not only compensation for damages, but also institutional reform and revisions to the law to prevent the repetition of the same mistakes (<a class="reference" href="#sixtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Suzuki T, Minaguchi M, Sekiguchi M. Law and safety of drug. Eidell Institute; 2015,p.348 [Japanese]." id="62">62</a>).</p>
                    <p>This historical background has created a situation in which the mass media and regulators cannot easily ignore the victims' complaints about the side-effects of new vaccines. It is here that we may find a clue on how to solve this problem. It is necessary to enhance transparency at every step of the approval process for pharmaceutical products, from new-drug development to post-marketing surveillance. At the same time, it is crucial to strengthen the management of conflicts of interest, and develop a system by which citizens can participate directly and have a voice in the planning of public health policy (<a class="reference" href="#sixtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chalmers I.
