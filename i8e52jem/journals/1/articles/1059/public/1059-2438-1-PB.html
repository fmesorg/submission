					<strong>DA Shore (ed). <em>The trust prescription for health care: building your reputation with consumers.</em> Health Administration Press, 2005. Pp 165, $63.00, ISBN 1567932401.</strong> Reviewed by Mathis RS in <em>J Med Ethics</em> 2006; 32: 555-556.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author, a founder director of the Trust Initiative at the Harvard School of Public Health, emphasises the importance of trust in the health care industry. He says that while many continue to trust their own doctors and nurses, they do not trust the delivery of health care itself. This is the result of the industry's unscrupulous behaviour and the media's overemphasis on reporting negative stories. His solutions are mostly common sense and he offers a step-by-step approach to building trust into the workings of an institution.
