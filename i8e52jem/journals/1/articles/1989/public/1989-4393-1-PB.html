				<h4>Doctors advertising, and drug  companies' pressures</h4>
				<p>
					I enclose an advertisement which appeared in the  Thane Plus edition of <em>The Times of India,</em> August 19, 2001. It gives details of  a prominent psychiatrist's schedule, his services and hospital address where he  can be contacted. This is blatant advertising to procure more patients. This  colleague has gone overboard and crossed all lines of ethics. It is strange  that a reputed newspaper like the <em>TOI</em> should actually comply despite knowing  that advertisement is not allowed in the medical profession.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, medical  representatives have been watching me with the help of chemists to see whether  I was prescribing their drugs, and if not, which drugs were prescribed instead.  This is clearly encroaching on my liberty to prescribe the drugs of my choice.  They actually tell me the details of drugs I had prescribed and how their  product was not pushed despite their requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirdly, some doctors in Mumbra,  Kalwa and areas surrounding these suburbs display their signboards. These  boards are not close to their hospitals, but at strategic locations nearly five  km away from the hospital, giving details of doctors, their services and  directions on how to get there. A board for a Mumbra hospital was found outside  Panvel. At regular intervals the signboard is repeated, reminding the traveller  about the hospital. Is this ethical?
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope FMES will look into these issues  and let us have guidelines on what actions to take.
