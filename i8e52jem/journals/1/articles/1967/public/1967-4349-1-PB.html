				<h4>Issues in Medical Ethics (3)</h4>
				<p>
					I am receiving your journal regularly and go through it with interest. I particularly appreciated the article on medical practitioners abetting politicians...
				</p>
				<p>
					One topic which hasn't been discussed so far in Issues in Medical Ethics is the unethical promotion of drugs by pharmaceutical companies. Although this may be an obviously unethical and undesirable activity to many of us, there are an equally large number of practitioners who don't see any wrong or even feel it is a legitimate activity. An article on the topic, may be at a 'lower' level than other articles appearing in the journal, may be necessary.
