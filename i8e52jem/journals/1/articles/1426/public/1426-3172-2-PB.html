				<h4>Abortion: a fundamental  right</h4>
				<p>
					One finds oneself  agreeing with much of Dr. S.G. Kabra's views on abortion in India <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kabra SG: Abortion in India: not a right but a state-sponsored programme. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000 VIII (3): 70." id="1">(1)</a>. The  Indian State's interest in providing abortion services in the country, has as  Dr. Kabra points out, been governed essentially by the exigencies of the family  planning programme. The programme operates both from eugenic considerations -  the perceived 'need' to prevent some sections of the population from  reproducing themselves - and from perceived 'national' interests. He also rightly  focuses on the indifference of the State in allowing illegal or badly performed  abortions that can lead to a range of health problems for women, and in some  cases, their deaths.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, I take objection to the thrust of Dr Kabra's argument, which suggests  that the right to abortion involves the 'fundamental rights of two individuals  - the mother and the foetus'. Simultaneously, a connection is drawn between  abortion and infanticide. The statement on what stage a foetus can be seen as  an individual in its own right is disturbing. It tends to look at abortion at a  certain stage of the pregnancy as being acceptable and unacceptable at others.  The notion that the foetus is an individual in its own right infuses an  emotional angle to the entire debate on abortion that in my view is  unacceptable. It can, taken to its logical conclusion, lead to the perception  that contraception itself is unacceptable, as it can destroy a potential life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abortion causes emotional turmoil for many women and their families, especially  when accompanied with coercion by the state. However, it cannot be seen as  anything less than an unalienable right for women. Women have a right over  their bodies and their reproduction, that cannot be transferred to their  families or the state. This is more relevant in this country where childbearing  is modified by social mores; and women's right to decide when and if they want  to bear children remains a theoretical rather than a practical right. The  existing laws on abortion are inadequate and designed to serve the interests of  the family planning programme, rather than to allow women to regain control  over their bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (henceforth MTP Act) was passed in  1971. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971. Department of Women and Child Welfare, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. 1971." id="2">(2)</a>. Under this act, women have a restricted right to abortion. The  declared objects of the Act are to help women who become pregnant as a result  of rape, married women who are pregnant due to contraceptive failure, or to  reduce the 'risk' of severely handicapped children being born. As with the family  planning programme, the right to contraception is seen as applicable only to  married women, marital sexuality alone being seen as legitimate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Under the MTP Act, regulations on record maintenance require the doctor  performing the operation to maintain records on each abortion which include the  reasons for the abortion &mdash; legally, the woman cannot avoid giving an  explanation. This register is a secret document, to be destroyed by the doctor  at the end of five years since the date of the last entry.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is much scope for misuse. Many married women undergo abortions without  the knowledge of their family members, including, at times, their husbands. For  single women, the need for secrecy is even more pressing. Not only do they face  a greater degree of social control; the abortion may well be out of the purview  of the MTP Act. Given this, the register can easily become a tool for blackmail  in the hands of unscrupulous medical practitioners and medical staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					Besides, the insistence that woman explain their reasons for an abortion, and  denying the clause of contraceptive failure to single women, demonstrate the  not so hidden moral agenda of law makers. At a more general level, this makes a  mockery of women's right to abortion, and in an extended understanding, women's  rights over their bodies.
