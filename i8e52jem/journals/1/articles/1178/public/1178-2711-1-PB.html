				<h4>Why medicines cost so much  ...</h4>
				<p>
					According to a report prepared by the National Institute for  Health Care Management, a non-profit research foundation in the United States,  increases in the sales of the 50 drugs that were most heavily advertised to  consumers accounted for half the increase in drug spending in 2000. The  spending increase was not from an increase in drug prices but from an increase  in number of prescriptions of the 50 drugs. The Food and Drugs Administration  is now reviewing whether it should change the rules it enacted in 1997 that  made it easier for medicines to be advertised on television. The drug companies  objected, saying that their own studies showed no such link. Also, the benefits  of advertising, such as encouraging patients to seek treatment which they had  ignored, were being ignored. The heavily advertised drugs include those for  arthritis, and for lowering cholesterol.

				<h4>Dangerous x-ray machines</h4>
				<p>
					Excessive hazardous radiation from x-ray machines has now  attracted the attention of the Supreme Court which issued notices to the  centre, all state governments, the director-general of health services  and the Atomic Energy Radiation Board (AERB). A public interest litigation  filed by J P Sharma has sought a direction for the implementation of the safety  code. MR Sharma's counsel, Anis Suhrawardy, said that flagrant violation of the  code on radiation from x-ray machines was jeopardising public health.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr Suhrawardy told the court that the AERB had on December 13,  1986, issued a safety code with regard to medical diagnostic x-ray equipment  and installations and followed it up with detailed safety measures required to  be taken for these machines. But, due to wilful breach of these norms by  various hospitals and diagnostic clinics, people throughout the country were  suffering from hazards of radiation emission, the petition said. "As per a  conservative estimate, over 50,000 diagnostic x-ray units are added every  year."
				</p>
				<p>
					Citing various scientific data, the petition claimed that the  effect of such radiation would be ionisation of the cells in a human body,  which could lead to a series of radio-chemical and bio-chemical reactions,  resulting in or causing grave damage to important bio-molecules such as  proteins and DNA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such damage could further lead to inhibition of cell division,  chromosome aberrations, gene mutation and even cell death, the petition said.  "It would be seen that the uncontrolled radiation received by a human  being for a long time is capable of leading to diseases like blood cancer, skin  cancer mostly on hands, shortening of life span, impotency in males and  infertility in females." The authorities which have been entrusted with  enforcing the radiation protection rules and the provisions of the safety code,  have left the public at the mercy of the offending clinics, the petition said.

				<h4>The medical councils</h4>
				<p>
					When the president of a body, that is cranked out to be the  central regulator of the medical profession in the country, is himself  discovered to be corrupt, it says something about the state of the profession  today. In a recent case, the Delhi High Court was confronted with  evidence that the Medical Council of India (MCI) was in danger of fast  becoming the Medical Corruption of India. Therefore, the court removed the  president of the MCI with immediate effect on charges of his having misused his  position for monetary gains. So disturbed was the court by the evidence at hand  that it directed the CBI to inquire into the charges against the gentleman and  ordered the MCI to hold fresh elections within three months.
				</p>
				<p>
					The court's concern is perfectly justified considering the seminal  role the MCI is supposed to play. Under the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956,  the MCI is meant, among other tasks, to maintain uniform standards of medical  education, to recognise or de-recognise medical qualifications of medical  institutions in India and abroad, and to register all the qualified doctors in  the country. These functions it is expected to discharge through regular  monitoring, inspection and interaction on the ground. The sheer scope of the  MCI's powers invests it with enormous responsibilities, especially at a time  when the medical profession in the country has come under a cloud for its lack  of commitment, faltering standards and general venality. Given the rush to set  up medical colleges, given the frenzy with which young students vie for the  limited seats in the medical colleges of the country, it is exceedingly easy  for corruption to raise its head in organisations like these, which ultimately  are only as good as the people who run them. The president of such a body, in  particular, plays a 'pivotal role', as the court put it, and must be an  individual above suspicion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Interestingly, in early September, the Bombay High Court in  another significant ruling, held that accredited members of the press shall be  permitted to attend inquiry proceedings conducted by the Maharashtra Medical  Council (MMC) to probe misconduct of medical practitioners. The issue cropped  up in a case filed against a surgeon of Bombay Hospital for misconduct, in  which the MMC found the doctor guilty but allowed him to get away with a  warning. Allowing representatives from civil society to sit in at these  hearings will make them more transparent and effective, given the tendency for  professionals to display leniency towards each other, at the expense of better  medical practices. The two cases should go some way in making the teaching and  conduct of medicine in the country a little more accountable to the people it  is meant for. Before physicians can heal others, they need to heal themselves,  it seems.

				<h4>Blinded by cataract surgery</h4>
				<p>
					Gurcharan Singh went to the free eye camp near Yamunanagar for a  cataract operation, hoping to see the world with a new eye. According to him,  he ended up without sight and without an eye, after the doctor concerned  'gouged it out' to conceal an operation gone wrong. While the doctor who did  the operation denies the charge, a preliminary medical inquiry confirmed that  Gurcharan lost his eye after the surgery. It is silent on whether his eye was  also removed. Five other farmers from surrounding villages who went to the camp  in September - &copy;&copy;including Gurcharan's uncle Pritam Singh - say they have lost  vision in the eyes operated upon, like Gurcharan. At least one of them,  Banwarilal, from village Amloha, also alleges that his eye was gouged out. The  operation was carried out by a private eye surgeon from Get Well hospital,  Radaur, Dr H R Gutain, who organised the eye camp and performed the surgeries  himself. Says Gurcharan, "We were taken in by the promises made by the  doctor."

				<h4>Died waiting for treatment</h4>
				<p>
					An unidentified 55-year-old man who had been waiting for  treatment near the chief medical officer's office in the government-run JJ  Hospital, died allegedly due to medical negligence. According to an eye  witness, Leslie Pereira, the police constable on duty, Prakash Kubde, who is  attached to the JJ Marg police station, first saw the man seated on the parapet  outside Ward Number 3 at 3 p.m. The police desk was installed near the ward  since it is a casualty ward. Mr Pereira said, "Kubde went out for a while  and when he returned he saw that the man had slumped to the floor. Kubde went  into the chief medical officer Dr Shashi Pawar's office and appraised him of the  matter. Plice sources say that Dr Pawar rudely asked Kubde to mind his own  business. They said, "The man remained unattended on the floor for 30-45  minutes. Later, when Dr Pawar admitted him for diagnosis, he was dead. The  frightened doctor then approached Kubde and urged him to issue a death after  admission certificate."

				<h4>Regulating ultrasound  clinics</h4>
				<p>
					The Supreme Court has undertaken the major task of facilitating a  government drive to identify clinics where sex determination tests are  illegally conducted. It summoned the health secretaries of 11 major states and  issued notices to five multinational concerns that supply ultrasound machines  in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					The court asked the health secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi,  Bihar, UP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and West  Bengal to be personally present on January 29 to explain the steps taken by  their states to implement the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and  Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1994.
				</p>
				<p>
					The direction was made when the court found that its orders for  registration of ultrasound clinics and the prosecution of those resorting to  illegal sex-determination tests were not complied with. The court issued  notices to five multinationals - Philips, Symonds, Toshiba, Larsen &amp;  Toubro, and Wipro GE. They have been asked to give the names and addresses of  the clinics and persons in India to whom they have sold these machines in the  last five years to help the government find out whether the clinics or persons  have been registered under the act. After asking the MNCs to identify the  purchasers of ultrasound machines, the courts said that considering the  importance of the matter, "it would be desirable for the Centre to frame  appropriate rules with regard to the sale of such machines to unregistered  clinics."
				</p>
				<p>
					The bench also directed each state to provide district-wise data  on ultrasound clinics as well as publicise the constitution of district  advisory committes. Under the act, people could approach these committees,  which could then order prosecution of the erring clinics.

				<h4>Test for HIV before  treating</h4>
				<p>
					When 28-year-old Ramesh (names of patients have been changed to  protect identity) sufered multiple injuries in a road accident, first aid was  not available because doctors first wanted to check his HIV status. And once he  tested positive, the private hospital he was admitted to refused to treat him.  Ramesh was refused admission at another private nursing home too before landing  at the Sassoon government hospital. But the delay cost him dearly. Gangrene had  set in and his leg had to be amputated. Nitin required surgery for his  distended abdomen. But the doctors preferred not to operate on the HIV-positive  youth. Nitin is no more.
				</p>
				<p>
					Renu died of renal failure. She was infected with HIV and such  patients are often denied life-saving haemodialysis. Surajmal Jain Agarwal (who  insists that his name not be changed)is the distressed father of Pawan who is  on his deathbed at a private hospital. Surajmal who hails from Aurangabad, was  virtually hounded out of private hospitals there, and gave up hope when a few  started closing their doors on him in Pune as well. Finally, one hospital did  admit his son, and after spending more than one lakh rupees, he is now resigned  to the brutal fact that life is slowly ebbing out of the once strapping young  lad. The National AIDS Policy, redrafted in December last year, clearly states  that HIV-positive patients cannot be denied treatment at government and semi-government  hospitals. But what about private ones? Several doctors and patients point out  that private hospitals get away by simply pegging the treatment rates to levels  which cannot be afforded by poor patients. Dr Sanjay Pujari, head of HIV  medicine and consultant at Ruby Hall Clinic, admits that the HIV status of a  patient does matter. For example, what would otherwise cost Rs 10,000 for a  Caesarean may be pegged at Rs 30,000 in case of an HIV patient. "A simple  lymph node biopsy may be charged Rs 1,000 in ordinary cases but the rate  goes up to Rs 7,000 in case of HIV patients," he says.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pujari says overcharging is one way to deny treatment to these  patients and points out that most HIV-positive patients die due to secondary  opportunistic infections like tuberculosis and meningitis. "Sometimes it  is even difficult to provide anti-TB drugs," he says, adding that the  government does not allocate funds for anti-retroviral therapy that costs more  than Rs 5,000 per month." What angers several social workers is the  alleged practice of HIV testing before any surgery. Says Kusum Phule, social  worker at Gadikhana, an STD clinic, " When AIDS cases were first reported,  there was overall panic, with doctors refusing to even touch such patients.  While that may no longer be evident, what is cruel is the pre-operative HIV  testing." Once a patient's HIV status is disclosed, doctors find ways to  deny treatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Nitin Bora of Kayakalp, a non-governmental organisation which  works towards creating awareness on HIV among commercial sex workers, points  out that doctors often try to get away by saying that their hospital does not  have the infrastructure to manage HIV infection. However, since most  HIV-positive patients need treatment for secondary infections like TB, no special  infrastructure is required for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agrees Pujari who has treated 5,000 HIV patients since 1996 and  seen two die per week, "It is high time we integrated HIV care in routine  care. It is normal to sterilise instrumentse and other equipment for all  patients. AIDS patients can be managed within the same infrastructure."
