				<h4>Vaccine industry an "integral part" of recommended vaccination schedule</h4>
				<p>
					A connection has been drawn between the fact that almost  														every vaccine available in the Indian market - including several  														that are not listed in the national immunisation programme -  														features in the schedule drawn up by the Indian Academy  														of Paediatrics Committee of Immunisation (IAPCOI) and the  														fact that almost all of the Academy's funds come from major  														pharmaceutical companies. However, the IAP feels there is no  														conflict of interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rs 26.8 lakh of the IAPCOI's fund of Rs 27.8 lakh is contributed  														by the industry: pharma major Wyeth contributed Rs 4.9 lakh;  														Sanofi Pasteur Rs 5.1 lakh; Glaxo SmithKline Rs 5 lakh; Merck Rs  														5 lakh; Serum Institute of India Rs 3 lakh; Sanofi Pasteur Rs 1.8  														lakh; and Pfizer Rs 2 lakh, according to the IAP's own Annual  														Report for 2012.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Sanjiv Lewin of the Department of Paediatrics, Clinical Ethics  														and Medical Education, St John's Medical College Hospital,  														Bangalore, has pointed out that nine out of 10 special invitees  														to the IAPCOI meeting represented the vaccine industry. To this,  														the IAPCOI convenor's defence was that the vaccine industry is  														"an integral part of the system that affects every aspect related  														to vaccines".

				<h4>Land transfer scandal in ICMR</h4>
				<p>
					Several senior serving and former officials of the Indian  														Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex body in India for  														the formulation, coordination and promotion of biomedical  														research have been arrested by order of the special fast track  														court of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on corruption  														charges. They include Bela Shah, head of the ICMR's division  														of non-communicable diseases; Ashok Kumar Srivastava,  														executive engineer; and Bhawani Thyagarajan, retired joint  														secretary in the Ministry of Health. Shah and Srivastava have  														now been suspended by the ICMR, pending investigation.
				</p>
				<p>
					After a two-year long investigation, the government's audit  														body, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India found  														that between 2002 and 2008, land belonging to the ICMRaffiliated  														Institute of Cytology and Preventive Oncology (ICPO)  														had been illegally transferred to a private housing society of  														employees by the ICMR executive council at far less than the  														market value, resulting in massive losses to the government  														exchequer. Originally intended for staff housing for ICPO, the  														land was taken over by a private housing society, of which the  														accused were members.
				</p>
				<p>
					Former Director General, ICMR, NK Ganguly, and former Director,  														ICPO, BC Das, are also wanted in the case. While Ganguly is said  														to have claimed that the necessary government permissions  														for the land transfer were in place, the CAG and the CBI have  														denied this.

				<h4>Infamous two-finger test discarded</h4>
				<p>
					After repeated protests from women's organisations and health  														activists, the infamous and irrelevant two-finger test used to  														determine whether a rape victim is "accustomed to sexual  														intercourse" has finally been discarded. The Nagpur bench  														of the Bombay High Court, while hearing a public interest  														litigation,<em> Dr Ranjana Pardhi v. Union of India and Others</em>, on  														sexual assault protocols for investigators and the healthcare  														response to sexual assault victims, directed the state to  														implement the recent forensic examination manual prepared  														by a government-appointed panel, incorporating revisions  														suggested by Dr Indrajit Khandekar, Associate Professor of  														Forensic Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical  														Sciences, Wardha (See http://ijme.in/211ed02.html and http://  														www.cehat.org/go/SexualViolence/Press).
				</p>
				<p>
					The proforma based on the panel report represents a major  														shift from the earlier practice, and includes recording patient  														history, listing specimen collection, opinion writing, and followup  														check-ups on the rape survivor's mental and physical  														condition. "The court told us that we should start implementing  														their 2011 order. The Directorate of Health Services and the  														medical colleges will now have to distribute the proforma  														of the forensic examination in their respective hospitals and  														centres," said Bharati Dangre, who appeared for the state.

				<h4>WB sterilisation camp breaches all norms</h4>
				<p>
					Soon after a sterilisation camp in Malda district of West Bengal  														in February, over 100 women are reported to have been  														dumped unconscious in an open field. The operations were  														carried out by two doctors from the Manikchak Rural Hospital  														and one from the nearby Ratua healthcare centre, who then  														instructed the helpers to shift the women to the neighbouring  														field, while some were still under the anaesthetic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The sterilisation camp was organised in the Manikchak rural  														hospital and around 103 women underwent the ligation  														procedure at the camp. They were then moved to a nearby  														field as the hospital infrastructure could not accommodate  														more than 30 women patients. The camp was organised in  														blatant disregard of basic health and safety rules, which include  														restricting the number of sterilisations to 25 procedures per  														day and placing patients under observation for a minimum  														three-hour period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many of the patients, dumped in the field, fainted due to the  														pain. Many others were sent home in cycle vans as the hospital  														did not have ambulance services. The report says one patient  														was seriously injured after the cycle van in which she was sent  														off collided with another vehicle.
				</p>
				<p>
					The West Bengal chief medical officer has ordered an inquiry  														and promised to act on the report when it comes out.

				<h4>Donated hearts going waste</h4>
				<p>
					The absence of a well organised programme to retrieve  														donated hearts recently resulted in the discarding of 250 hearts  														in Chennai. This occurred in spite of the deaths of thousands  														of patients in the country due to end stage heart disease,  														every year. While other organs are harvested from brain dead  														donors, hearts are often treated as medical waste or left in the  														donor's body. Lack of co-ordination among transplant surgeons  														and low levels of awareness among patients aggravate  														the situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chennai is said to be foremost in performing heart transplants  														in the country, yet only 17% of donated hearts were utilised in  														the state of Tamil Nadu last year. Of the organs from 306 donors  														received by the state organ transplant registry, 563 kidneys  														and 280 livers were retrieved, while the figure for hearts is just  														52. Part of the problem is the delay, as the heart is the last to  														be retrieved after other organs, which often makes it unfit for  														use. Another is that cardiologists don't spare the time to make  														patients aware of the fact that they may not survive without a  														transplant.

				<h4>BMC's killing delays</h4>
				<p>
					Twenty children on the waiting list for cardiac surgery at  														Mumbai's KEM Hospital died between January 2012 and March  														2013 because they could not have the operation. The reason:  														there were just two antiquated heart-lung machines at the  														only civic or state-run hospital in Mumbai with a department  														for paediatric cardiac surgery. And one of these gave up  														the ghost after 29 years of service. The hospital's paediatric  														ward has a waiting list of over 700 children aged between  														one and five years, waiting breathlessly for life-saving open  														heart surgery. This dismal situation is simply the result of the  														municipal corporation's criminal neglect of the upkeep of the  														hospital's equipment. The hospital is said to have approached  														the BMC for a new machine in 2009, but no replacement has  														yet been ordered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The civic body's four year-long delays over floating and  														acceptance of tenders have meant that the only such machine  														has been reserved for "emergencies". The Additional Municipal  														Commissioner, BMC, has agreed that this situation has not  														arisen due to any cash crunch in what press reports call the  														"world's richest civic body", with a budget for healthcare of Rs  														27,000 crore. Following the shocked public response to the  														news, civic officials have said they will send surgeons to the  														other two civic hospitals to operate in shifts and reduce the  														backlog of KEM cases; the BMC will also float fresh tenders for  														purchase of a machine which will take a minimum of three  														months to arrive. Dr Devi Shetty of Narayan Hrudayalaya,  														Bangalore, offered to operate on all the children on the waiting  														list within seven months, and the Bombay High Court admitted  														a public interest litigation on the matter. Now the BMC has  														worked out a scheme for surgery on 288 critically ill children at  														four private Mumbai hospitals under the Rajiv Gandhi Jivandayi  														Yojana scheme and will bear the cost of surgery and postoperative  														care.

				<h4>Dubious autopsy in Bhandara case</h4>
				<p>
					The deaths of three sisters aged 11, eight and six, whose bodies  														were found floating in a well in Bhandara district, Maharashtra,  														on February 14, shocked the entire state. After initial theories  														that the children had been raped and then murdered, serious  														doubts were raised about the reliability of the post mortem  														which was apparently conducted without doing the basic lung  														and diatom tests, but included the banned two-finger test on  														Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Vol X No 2 April-June 2013  														[ 84 ] the dead bodies. Further, the bodies had not been kept in cold  														storage, and were decomposing after being in the water for  														several hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					An embarrassed state administration placed the autopsy video  														recording and findings before a forensic expert, who stated  														that there was no evidence of rape. The case was again put  														before a three-member forensic team, which said the deaths  														were caused by drowning and no rape was indicated. Heads  														are now set to roll, and the administration has declared certain  														steps to be taken in future:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						training programmes at government medical colleges in  															Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. for medical officers from every  															district hospital;
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						for complicated cases, expert opinion will be sought  															from the forensic medicine department of the nearest  															government medical college;
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						19 new posts of medical officers, with special knowledge  															of forensic science, will be created "in those districts where  															there are no government medical colleges".

				<h4>Drug overdose deaths involve pharmaceuticals</h4>
				<p>
					Researchers studying data from the US National Vital  														Statistics System multiple cause-of-death file found 38,329  														drug overdose deaths in the US in 2010, about 58% of which  														involved pharmaceuticals. They also found that when patients  														overdose on prescription opioid painkillers, other drugs given  														for mental health disorders are often part of the problem,  														These were antidepressants in 13.4% of the deaths, followed  														by anti-epileptic and anti-Parkinsonism drugs at 6.8%, and  														then by antipsychotics and neuroleptics at 4.7% . Dr Leonard  														Paulozzi,, the lead researcher, wrote in a letter to the<em> Journal  														of the American Medical Association:</em> "This analysis confirms the  														predominant role opioid analgesics play in pharmaceutical  														overdose deaths, either alone or in combination with  														other drugs,"
				</p>
				<p>
					The researchers emphasised the importance of prescription  														drug monitoring programmes and electronic health records  														in order to "identify risky medication use and inform treatment  														decisions, especially for opioids and benzodiazepines."

				<h4>SC issues notice in HPV writ petition</h4>
				<p>
					Notice was issued to the Central government on a public  														interest writ petition filed by health activists Kalpana Mehta  														and others of the Gramya Resource Centre for Women, Andhra  														Pradesh, The petition said that Gardasil and Cervarix, the two  														Human Papilloma Virus vaccines intended to treat cervical  														cancer, are unlicensed, unproven, and hazardous. It said that  														the Drugs Controller General of India's office and the health  														ministry had granted permission for clinical trials of these  														vaccines without adequate research on their safety. This was  														in breach of an order of the relevant Parliamentary Standing  														Committee of April 2010.
				</p>
				<p>
					The petition alleged that while Gardasil contained r-DNA as  														found in samples from different countries including India,  														this was denied by the manufacturer. It also stated that the  														production of Cervarix involved insect cells and protein  														which enter the bloodstream of trial subjects and could  														cause infections, tumours and cancer. "In addition, the Drugs  														Controller has not even set standards of acceptable limits for  														such contamination in vaccines on the basis of which he could  														have found them safe for licensing," stated the petitioners.
				</p>
				<p>
					The petitioners stressed that this project was meant to  														influence the government to accept these vaccines for  														introduction in the public health sector.
