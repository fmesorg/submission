					<em>I have been charged with misconduct - for the second time -  for criticising the MEC Health of my province, Bevan Goqwana for worsening the  health services since he took over. I said if he is running a private ambulance  service (evidence is there), ran a private practice when he was Superintendent  of Umtata General Hospital, made false claims to medical aids, had stolen drugs  found in his surgery and also failed to spend R33 million earmarked for  HIV/AIDS containment in the last financial year, then he should be charged and  removed. I face five charges of misconduct for bringing him and the department  and the country and the Constitution into disrepute. Tell me what you think.</em>

					<em>Is a public health doctor bound to talk if he notices corruption  and inefficiency, even if he has been warned to shut up or clear anything he  wants to say with his superiors? Can a doctor in the public service be an  office-bearer of a political party? Is it not better to keep your head down and  obey orders? The former MEC Health Dr Trudy Thomas has just resigned from the  ANC and has given cogent and powerful reasons for doing so. Another doctor Dr  Pat Praciado who worked at Victoria Hospital in Alice was shot dead three years  ago when she threatened to expose corruption in the hospital. The hit men were  arrested and charged. They in turn accused the superintendent of her hospital  of offering R40,000 to despatch her. Today it is the Super who is retired to an  opulent farm nearby. The honest police of Alice - corrupt in other cases -  could find no evidence to link him to the murders.</em>

					<em>Yes, ethics is great, but let us put it into practice a little  bit. Let us not be like those Free State ethicists who said recently that the  Biko doctors were treated too harshly because, after all, they were just part  of the mores of their time. I gathered lots of trouble in the '60s and '70s for  speaking out against apartheid at that time. The ethical climate has not  changed. I am now shunned - as I was then - by ordinary people because they  could get into trouble if they spoke to me. Could it be ethically true that the  more things change, the more they stay the same?</em>

					Dear Costa,
				</p>
				<p>
					I am not knowledgable  enough to comment on the veracity of the charges you aired publicly against the  MEC, but clearly similar issues apply to us working as academics. Economic  rationalist VCs vandalise currently Australian universities. Unionists like  myself picketed our institutions (I understand that 'we' don't do this in South  Africa for one reason or other) in protest, for instance against the culling of  humanities faculties (I write on this in the May M&amp;Gs education  supplement). Bottom line is: if we criticise our institutions publicly for this  sort of thing, or if you criticise managers of hospitals in which you worked,  they will come down hard on us. Arguably we did/do the ethically correct thing,  but their response is predictable. If our criticism is correct and they acted  unprofessionally, and unethically, we might be able to occupy the moral high  ground. We certainly had/have an obligation to act under such circumstances,  but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that they will take it lying  down. Eventually we pay a price for this (I once lost a job I badly needed  financially for speaking my mind). All we can probably hope for is to generate  sufficient publicity and solidarity to carry the day. Unfortunately, there is  some empirical evidence that, for instance, whistleblowers have been unable to  ever find a paid job in their profession again, even though they won their  court cases etc.

					There is some good news  on the horizon perhaps: My students tend to be furious about what's going on in  public hospitals these days (with regard to availability if HAART for rape  victims for instance). When I ask them whether they think that they have a  moral obligations as (future) health care professionals to speak out publicly  against the government's stance on this (and other) matter(s) they fairly  uniformly reply in the affirmative. How many of them will eventually have the  courage to stand up and be counted - your guess is as good as mine.
