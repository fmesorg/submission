					The case study 'Cross  subsidy in public hospitals' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sreejit EM. Cross-subsidy in public hospitals. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 100-101." id="1">(1)</a> refers to an everyday practice. We have  regularly called for more than one lumbar puncture needle, more than a few  disposable needles, and more than one endotracheal tube, so that we can use  these on 'poor' patients. I had not thought about the implications of such  practices as the writer has expressed them. I am trying to hold together a  system which is falling apart, while serving my patients. I should challenge  the system. Instead, what I am doing is bailing it out.
