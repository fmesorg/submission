					Sixth Shri B. V. Narayana Reddy Memorial Lecture, Indian Institute of World Culture, Bangalore
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					I am honoured to have  been invited to deliver this annual lecture in memory of Shri B. V. Narayana  Reddy. My earliest recollection of Shri Narayana Reddy is of meeting him,  almost forty years ago, with my father who had taken me to what everyone used  to call 'Mysore Bank'. To my adolescent eyes, the two gentlemen looked very  similar. Both dressed well, even immaculately with a dignity that came  naturally. Both wore the Mysore turban with distinction, were widely read and,  of course, were widely respected. They represented the finest traditions of old  Mysore.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  topic of today's lecture would have evoked Shri Narayana Reddy's keen interest.  I am sure of this because in an autobiographical sketch that he wrote a few  years before his death, Shri Reddy mentioned that a classic he read more often  than any other was Meditations by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and he went on to  speculate on the foundations of ethical life. It is a special pleasure for me  to pay this tribute to the memory of Shri B. V Narayana Reddy and the tradition  he represented.

				<h4>Studying our genes</h4>
				<p>
					An important goal of current research into human genetics is to identify  genetic changes that lead to human disease so that effective interventions can  be developed. Towards this goal, the molecular biology of human genes is being  studied and there is an ambitious programme- the human genome project- to  determine the DNA coding for the approximately 50,000 to 100,000 genes  estimated to be present in each of our cells. Genes are also being mapped by  classical genetic methods, which involve collecting detailed information on  families. This approach, called pedigree analysis, permits localisation of  particular genes on individual chromosomes, estimation of distances between  genes on the same chromosome and also the chances that two genes present on a  chromosome will be passed on together to a child. Such analyses permit the  geneticist to correlate the presence or absence of particular marker genes with  the chance of that embryo or child inheriting a disease that is determined by a  gene located close to that marker.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  potential benefits of this new genetics are far reaching but there are also  risks in terms of unanticipated consequences. The development of routine tests  for detecting predispositions to disease and other human characteristics has  serious implications for the practice of medicine, for the legal system, for  insurance, for employment practices and for numerous other areas of society.  This new knowledge combined with rapidly developing technologies in handling  human gametes and embryos, will take us into highly complex and uncharted  terrain. In this talk, I will touch upon a few of these issues as indicators of  the type and range of problems that are emerging.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>An early ethical dilemma</h4>
				<p>
					As early as 1965, long before the advent of the new genetics, there were  indications of the type of ethical questions that would emerge as a result of  advances of genetic technology. In that year, a paper based on a survey of  Scottish prisoners was published in which it was observed that seven out of the  one hundred and ninety seven prisoners with a history of violent crime that  were studied had an extra Y chromosome in their cells. This seemed significant  because an XYY child is born, on an average, once in every thousand male  births. Subsequent provocative reports in the news media and scientific  journals that men with an extra Y chromosome were destined to lives of  criminality created demands for screening of individuals in jails and for  prospective studies among new-born and school-going boys with the intention  of following their behavioural development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Partly  as a result of intervention by the Boston-based Committee on Responsible  Genetics, this survey, proposed by a few US scientists, was stopped. The  Committee on Responsible Genetics raised the following issues: if a survey of  school-going children was conducted as planned, who would be privy to the  information that particular boys were XYY? Should their parents be told? Should  their teachers and school principal know? Might not such information lead to  stigmatisation of such boys as 'abnormal'? The parents and siblings may,  unconsciously or otherwise, begin to treat the XYY child differently from  others. Special meaning may be attached by parents and teachers to childhood  pranks when they involve XYY children. Who will ensure confidentiality of such  information? How might insurance companies and employers react to such  information about an applicant? In the face of stigmatisation and  discrimination, the XYY individual might challenge society's norms resulting in  what has been called a self-fulfillment of the prophecy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since  about one in a thousand newborn children carries an extra Y chromosome, a few  prospective studies were eventually done and the development of such XYY  children was followed into adolescence. The findings suggest that XYY children  fall within the normal range, but with an array of relatively non-specific  behavioural differences in attention, cognition, motor skills and personality.  The only criminal history found was for minor offences not characterised by  violence or aggression. In other words, most male children with an additional Y  chromosome grow up reasonably well-adjusted and but for prior knowledge of  their chromosome constitution, little significance would probably be attached  to behaviour that may be outside the normal range. Nevertheless, in the US,  because of the publicity surrounding the XYY chromosome constitution, about 50%  of parents have elected to terminate pregnancies for which prenatal diagnostic  tests indicated the presence of an extra Y chromosome.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here  is a situation in which seemingly normal male foetuses were aborted in spite of  lack of a consensus among scientists about genetic predisposition of the XYY  male to more violent, antisocial and criminal behaviour. These abortions were  done on foetuses whose XYY chromosome constitution was unexpectedly diagnosed  during prenatal diagnostic studies that were done on account of advanced  maternal age or other reasons and not because there was prior interest on the  part of the parents or the clinician to avoid the birth of an XYY child.
				</p>
				<p>
					This  case study illustrates how parents' perceptions (or misconceptions) of the  relationship between genes and behaviour can determine decisions about  continuation of pregnancy.
				</p>

				<h4>Prenatal determination of foetal sex in India</h4>
				<p>
					An ethical issue that has been widely discussed in our country is prenatal  determination of sex by amniocentesis. This involves removal of a few cells  from the amniotic fluid that surrounds the growing foetus, usually before the  fourth month of pregnancy. From these cells, by appropriate analysis of  chromosomes or DNA, the sex of the foetus can be readily told. This technique  is useful to prevent the birth of male children carrying sex-linked genetic  disorders in families with a history of such familial disease. Duchenne  muscular dystrophy is an example. The procedure would involve not only the  verification of the sex of the foetus but also the use of appropriate DNA  probes to determine whether the foetus, if male, had inherited from the mother  the defective gene that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
				</p>
				<p>
					When  amniocentesis was first made available in this country at the All India  Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, the first hundred parents who  requested this procedure had no obvious history of familial disease. All had  two or three normal daughters and now wished to have a son. Apparently, no  couple who had two or three sons and now wanted a daughter asked for such a  diagnosis. Seeing this distortion, prenatal sex determination was discontinued  in that institute.
				</p>
				<p>
					As  a result of criticism in the press and demonstrations, principally by women's  groups, the Government of Maharashtra enacted a law banning the determining of  foetal sex when no genetic disease was involved. It is, however, common  knowledge that such determination is done widely, especially in the states of  Punjab, Maharashtra and the Union Territory of Delhi, often using highly  unreliable methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  bill was being considered by Parliament and the Government of India to prevent  the use of amniocentesis solely .for the purpose of determining the sex of  apparently normal foetuses. As often happens, this bill and the discussions  relating to it have been made irrelevant by technological advances which have  nothing to do with genetics. I refer to the non-invasive method of ultrasound  imaging, which permits a trained observer to determine whether the growing  foetus is male or female during the early stages of pregnancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given  the strong emotional and cultural underpinnings behind the parental desire to  achieve a balance among the sex of their offspring, we may be eventually  required to harmonise the parent's right to have a child of the desired sex and  society's attempts to avoid discrimination based on sex. An ethically  acceptable approach to this dilemma- and one that avoids termination of  pregnancies of the 'wrong sex'- may become available if current attempts at  separating male-determining (Y-bearing) and female determining (X-bearing)  human spermatozoa reach higher levels of reliability.

				<h4>Yearning for children</h4>
				<p>
					Kathryn Allen Rabuzzi, writing in The Encyclopaedia of Religion, says that  "historically and cross-culturally, the family, in various forms, has  (until the late twentieth century in post-industrialised nations) been so basic  to human existence as to be a universal symbol of ultimacy." It has also  been said that "the significance of the genetic connection between parent  and child undoubtedly is part of what makes infertility a painful  experience" and why adoption does not appear to satisfy 'the yearning to  create a version of oneself unfold and develop.' (J. L. Hill 1992) It is  therefore understandable that infertile couples often explore all possible  avenues- from the religious to the biotechnological- to have a child of their  own and raise a family.
				</p>
				<p>
					Embryo  and gamete technology have developed as rapidly as genetic technology and  prenatal genetics are now very active disciplines. Methods of in vitro  fertilisation and assisted reproduction have permitted many couples to overcome  the pain of infertility. This has, however, led to novel family definitions and  relationships: children with one biological father and two mothers, one genetic  and the other gestational; children with two fathers, one known to the child  and the other genetic, often unknown, who donated the sperm. There are also  adoptive parents and adoptive children.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  fifty-nine-year-old British woman gave birth to so-called test-tube twins in an  Italian clinic and a sixty-two-year-old woman became pregnant after implantation  of a fertilised egg. These cases of reproduction assisted by gamete and embryo  biotechnology and the birth of a white boy to a black mother by similar methods  have renewed the debate over the ethical and moral dimensions of such  reproductive choices. The controversy over the proposal of British scientists  to use eggs recovered from aborted foetuses to help infertile couples and thus  overcome the shortage of human eggs became heated. This technique would, in  effect, lead to the birth of children whose mothers were never born!
				</p>
				<p>
					In  many Western societies, the concept of the traditional family had come under  severe pressure even before embryo technology and genetic testing became  available. With the advent of the first, and increasing availability of the  second, perplexing ethical and legal questions have arisen. Courts in  California- -and subsequently courts the world over- -have distinguished  between the genetic parent (donor of the egg) or 'genetic progenitor' and the  gestational parent (the woman in whose womb the foetus developed). In a  landmark custody case in which a woman who had no uterus had her eggs  fertilised by her husband's sperm and hired another woman to carry the  pregnancy to term, the judges rules in favour of the genetic linkage and said  that the couple whose gametes were used for the in vitro fertilisation were the  'genetic, biological and natural parents' and were, therefore, entitled to  retain custody of the child. In the US the term 'natural' or 'biological'  mother is now widely understood to mean the 'genetic' mother. However, it  appears, this view that the gestational mother is no more than a foster parent,  is prevalent only in the US and Israel, whereas in several other countries  including the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and South Africa, the courts  have held the view that the woman who gives birth is the child's mother.

				<h4>Unwanted groups</h4>
				<p>
					In the past, in many  societies, the poor, the unpopular and those perceived as disabled (whether or  not the perceived disability was genetic in origin) have been targets of  discriminatory policies and prompted eugenic measures such as sterilisation  aimed at 'purifying the race'. Lancelot Hogben, a geneticist active in the  1930s and '40s, angrily reacted to such policies and, referring to the  prevalence of haemophilia in the royal houses of Europe, reminded that no one  has 'publicly proposed sterilisation as the remedy for defective kingship.'
				</p>
				<p>
					The  targeting of gypsies and Jews for elimination from Nazi Germany is well known. Less well known. perhaps, is the similar targeting of individuals and their  families for carrying a specific genetic defect, Huntington's disease. The  symptoms of Huntington's disease are rapid and progressive neurological and  mental deterioration in adult life, leading to death within a few years of the  onset of the disease. It is an autosomal dominant gene defect, meaning that a  child has a fifty percent chance of inheriting the disease from an affected  parent. Since the first symptoms appear when an individual is in his or her  forties or fifties, the patient would have had children who, in turn, would not  know whether they are carriers of the defective gene until they themselves  reach middle age. The disease poses severe burdens on the individual and the  family and pre-symptomatic detection of the defective gene has therefore been  greatly desired. This gene has now been mapped and cloned and DNA probes are  available for prenatal diagnosis as well as for presymptomatic diagnosis of  children and adults.
				</p>
				<p>
					Huntington's  disease is one of several psychiatric disorders that were part of an  extraordinary policy in Europe during the Second World War. In July 1933, an  act was passed in Germany to enable compulsory sterilisation of anyone  suspected to carry Huntington's disease and eight other categories of disorder.  Professionals, including scientists, lawyers, doctors and others with  specialist training in what was called racial hygiene, were co-opted for this  purpose. A system of hereditary courts was set up and the state established  primacy over reproduction. As a result of the facade of legality and expert  opinion, appeals to higher courts were rejected (Weindling 1389). It is  estimated that in this well-organised campaign, 350,000 to 400,000 individuals  were sterilised, among whom there may have been 3,000-4,000 patients with  Huntington's disease and their families and that over 100 patients with this  disease may have been killed in one psychiatric clinic alone (Harper). I need  hardly remind the audience of the incidents in Poona where a number of young  women in an institute for the mentally handicapped were involuntarily subjected  to hysterectomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  is perhaps for the potential for such misuse of genetic data that at a meeting  of the European community on the human genome programme it was concluded that  the most important problems arising from genome mapping are 'moral rather than  practical and legislative'.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Breach of confidentiality</h4>
				<p>
					The type of pedigree analysis and DNA research that led to the identification  of the Huntington gene reveals information about the health status of  individuals belonging to the family whether or not they have agreed to be  investigated. Information about such individuals would become part of the  records of the investigator and the institution conducting the study.  Disclosure of such information, deliberately or inadvertently, can lead to  complex legal and ethical problems. Should a member of the family, who was not  part of the formal study, be told, for instance that he is a carrier of the  disease? Who owns this information?
				</p>
				<p>
					There  have been cases in which particular members of a large family wanted all  information for themselves, their spouses and their children deleted from  records. If, at some future date, it develops that the only means of linking an  individual to a crime is through DNA data collected as part of a scientific  study in which the individual had unwittingly participated, is such evidence  admissible? Is it ethical to disclose such information?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Gene therapy</h4>
				<p>
					A brief reference to gene therapy may be in order. By mid 1992, there were over  15 diseases for which gene therapy attempts were being made. In one case- - adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency- -its correction through gene therapy has  led to dramatic improvement in the health of affected children. There is  support from ethicists for such applications of gene therapy to somatic cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Controversy  continues to surround the extension of such methods to the germ line which  might enable the individual with the gene defect to bear children inheriting  the inserted normal copy of the gene in place of the defective gene. Dr. French  Anderson, who carried out the first somatic cell gene therapy for ADA  deficiency, stated: "Besides the medical arguments, there are a number of  philosophical, ethical and theological concerns. For instance, do infants have  the right to inherit an un-manipulated genome? Does the capacity of informed  consent have any validity for patients who do not yet exist? At what point do  we cross the line into 'playing God'?"
				</p>
				<p>
					The  feeling of many observers is that the germline gene therapy should not be  considered until much more is learned from somatic line therapy, until animal  studies demonstrate the safety and reliability of any proposed procedure and  until the public has been educated on the implications of the procedure.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Genes and behaviour</h4>
				<p>
					Many, perhaps most, human geneticists believe that there is a significant  genetic component to behaviour and that not all behaviour is equally influenced  by the physical, biological and psychological components of the environment.  This does not mean that heredity can be equated with inevitability because  genes do not determine 'destiny' in a predictable manner. V. Elvong Anderson  noted: " <em>Few, if any, behaviours are completely without genetic influence and  few behaviours are completely without environmental influence</em>."
				</p>
				<p>
					The  question has been posed whether, if the genes plus environment equation  explains all behaviour, there is room left for individual freedom and moral  responsibility. This question, if pursued properly, necessarily takes us into  the realms of moral beliefs and religion. Prudence suggests that I leave this  discussion incomplete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead,  I will end with a hopeful statement by a theologian, Ronald Cole Porter. He  asked the unusual question whether there is a genetic basis for the moral  agency within us. He concluded his enquiry thus: " <em>Genes appear to some to  lock us into a vast web of biological determinism that deprives us of what  distinguishes us from the rest of nature and so removes what we once thought  was essentially human. By contrast, it has been argued that far from posing an  ominous threat to humanity, behaviour genetics and related fields of research  offer to illumine more precisely the moral nature of the human situation</em>."
				</p>
				<p>
					I  end this talk by quoting Roger Shinn, Reinhold Neibhur Professor Emeritus of  Social Ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in New York: "To the perilous  leaps in power associated with war and ecology, we must now add genetic  knowledge. Past genetic theories, usually infected with prejudice, have brought  the world much sorrow. An ethical imagination, this time around, might do  better. The historical record gives us no assurance of that heightened insight,  but it allows us to hope."

				<h4>Why we must insist on informed consent...</h4>
				<p>
					The  very fact of exclusion from participation is a subtle form of suppression. It  gives individuals no opportunity to reflect and decide upon what is good for  them. Others who are supposed to be wiser and who, in any case, have more power  decide the question for them... This form of coercion and suppression is more  subtle and more effective than is overt intimidation and restraint. When it is  habitual and embodied in social institutions, it seems the normal and natural  state of affairs. <strong>&ndash; John Dewey</strong> (1859-1952)
				</p>
				<p>
					The  core idea of personal autonomy is... personal rule of the self while remaining  free from both controlling influences by others and personal limitations, such  as inadequate understanding, that prevent meaningful choice. <strong>&ndash; Tom L. Beauchamp and  James F. Childress</strong>
