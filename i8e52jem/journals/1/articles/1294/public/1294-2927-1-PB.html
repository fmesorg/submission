				<h4>Globalisation and doctors advertising</h4>
				<p>
					The  unspoken background of the debate on the ethics of doctors advertising <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya S K. Advertising remains unethical even in the digital age.

Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 19." id="4">4)</a> is globalisation and how it affects the medical profession, whether  it is their right to advertise, their obligation to provide information, their  opportunity to earn foreign exchange, or their duty to provide care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any  model of development which addresses the task of providing health care to all  must presuppose a social commitment by medical professionals. Why build  hospitals in rural and tribal areas if doctors are going to settle in the West,  or pack themselves in metropolises? Unfortunately, most doctors are driven by  the profit motive. They leave rural areas unattended, confining themselves to a  few cities where their increased density draws them into unhealthy competition  - hence the call for advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the  heart of the problem are deep-rooted weaknesses in our culture and education  system. We are made only technically proficient; our education does not instil  in us an ethos by which we live our lives. Nor do we understand the philosophy  and history of the subjects we learn in schools and colleges. 'Specialisation'  means technical compartmentalisation of a subject in our minds. That is why the  pursuit of science in our universities and national research and development  institutions has failed to generate great contributors like Raman and Bose in  the latter half of the last century. It seems that even medical education  suffers from this problem. Teachers have failed as a community to inspire  students; they have failed to convince, by setting an example, that competition  amongst doctors by advertisement in any form is unethical.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  true that word of mouth by a doctor is a form of low-key advertisement.  However, when done among patients, their relatives and friends, it is a fair  reflection of a patient's direct experience with the doctor. It is also a check  to doctors' efforts at self-promotion.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  power of the electronic medium enables it to reach many more potential clients  than can word of mouth. But without equally available information on doctors'  failure rates, and their patients' evaluations, people looking for doctors  through internet advertisements risk being misled by savvy doctors. Only if  such an electronic check exists, and is provided alongside the ads could  advertisement by doctors be considered fair and ethical. We cannot count on an  alert media to protect patients from incompetent doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Malpani equates 'advertising' with 'providing information'. Information can be  provided on the internet without advertisement. Doctors can use the electronic  media to place a mega directory on a website. Software allowing people to  locate a doctor would make information accessible without fancy advertisements  to lure patients. This would take care of Dr Malpani's <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mamdani B. and Mamdani M. Ethics of professional advertising. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9:18." id="3">(3)</a> objection that word  of mouth does not favour younger doctors. The 'grey beards' who unfairly use  their weight against freshers as contended by Mamdani and Mamdani <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A. Calls for advertising and market reforms in health care. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 19." id="4">(4)</a> will lose  their grip.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those  who support doctors' advertising quote Western codes which permit the practice <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Malpani A. Doctors should be allowed to advertise. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 16-17." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mamdani B. and Mamdani M. Ethics of professional advertising. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9:18." id="3">3)</a>. Jesani has pointed out that the call for advertising in the US stems  from the insecurity of corporate-controlled health care with its own serious  problems <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Jesani A. Calls for advertising and market reforms in health care. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 19." id="4">(4)</a>. Besides, should we equate the Indian and American situations just  because globalisation has forced us into a free market economy? The American  system offers some consumer protection; we are not able to do this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr  Malpani refers to 'the demands of changing times', to advocate advertisements  by doctors. Our health care system is not effective beyond urban limits because  doctors have ignored the demands of the times for several decades. Now,  globalisation seems to apply a much needed balm to our pricked conscience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would  like to cite the example of Baba Amte, a lawyer by profession. He attended a  six-month course in tropical medicine and then established a home for leprosy  patients at Warora, called Anandwan. Cured leprosy patients earn their living  and run the village with a self-confidence that has to be seen to be believed.  Baba Amte's sons and their wives have acquired medical degrees and devoted  their lives to rural and tribal health care, at times against the government's  serious antipathy towards the cause.
				</p>
				<p>
					One  son, Dr Prakash Amte, along with his wife Dr Mandakini, has worked since 1973  amongst the inaccessible Madia Gonds at Hemalkasa, promoted education and even  produced two Madia doctors who have decided to go back to work for the tribals  in the jungles instead of starting clinics in a city or abandoning the country.  Dr Vikas, the elder of the two sons, looks after the growing activities of  Anandwan and several other major projects. The next generation of Amtes has  also committed itself to this development programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately,  Dr Vikas and his wife Dr Bharati are hard pressed to find permanent doctors to  help run the hospital at Anandwan, though this beautiful village is close to  the Warora railway station. Unlike the Amtes and their dedicated teams, scores  of urban doctors don't seem to sense that 'the demands of the changing times'  are to serve the rural and tribal populations. They seem to be eagerly looking  forward to the patriotic feat of earning foreign exchange to eradicate the  nation's poverty.
