					On Nov. 25, 2000, 12 cancer support groups from  around the country joined hands to release the Declaration of Rights for People  with Cancer in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such rights have now become law in many countries  of the developed world. The Declaration of Rights released on that day, at the  first All India Cancer Support Groups' Conference, was adapted from the  Declaration of Rights drawn up by Cancer Link, United Kingdom.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rights include basic human rights which are  often violated once a person is diagnosed with cancer. These are: the right to  receive equal concern and attention whatever one's gender, caste,  socio-economic status or religious belief; the right to be treated with respect  and dignity and to have all needs &mdash; physical, social and psychological &mdash;  responded to, whatever the prognosis; the right to be told that one has cancer  in a sensitive manner and to share in all decision making thereafter; the right  to be fully informed about treatment options including the benefits and risks  involved; the right to be asked for one's informed consent before being entered  into a clinical trial; the right to refuse treatment, to ask for a second  opinion or to use complementary therapies.
				</p>
				<p>
					One too often hears of cases where information,  including the diagnosis, is withheld from the person with cancer on the plea  that he or she will be unable to handle it. This is by and large a specious  argument as studies conducted all over the world show that most people would  like to know where they stand. There is a need to train our medical students to  break bad news which is both an art and a science. What you say is as important  as how you say it and when you say it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, assumptions are made about people based on  stereotypes. This is reinforced by the fact that those who administer medical  and nursing care in super speciality hospitals in our urban centres come from a  particular background. As a result, villagers are often denied details about  their illness as illiteracy is equated with the inability to understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conversely, it is automatically assumed that an  educated and well dressed person knows all that needs to be known. Add to this  the paternalistic model of our medical system where the patient comes as humble  supplicant to the great and wise doctor. Those who have the temerity to ask for  a second opinion on a matter that concerns their life are literally shown the  door. "Don't bother to come back to me," is a familiar response.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next set of rights set out in the declaration  are of a more practical but equally important nature, especially in our  context. They concern the right to continue to receive quality care irrespective  of the ability to afford it; the right to have one's special welfare needs  acknowledged, which include claims arising out of physical disability; the  right to be considered for medical and life insurance; and the right to  employment without discrimination .
				</p>
				<p>
					The sad fact is that for many in this country  cancer is simply a death sentence. They cannot afford the expensive treatments  and drugs prescribed, as well as the costs involved in residing for long  periods of time in a big city. On the other hand, it is a tragedy that private  practitioners continue to prescribe prohibitively expensive treatments and  drugs even when they know that the disease has reached a terminal stage. The  desperation of the members of the family coupled with the inability of doctors  to acknowledge their limits result in many people dying grotesque deaths.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is despite the emergence of a specialised  branch of medicine known as palliative care which is being used very  effectively around the world to ensure that people with illnesses such as  cancer continue to enjoy a good quality of life right till the end. In India,  not only is palliative care not taught in the medical curriculum, but oral  morphine, the cornerstone of the WHO's pain control ladder, is out of the reach  of most cancer patients in India. There are only a few hospitals, again located  in the cities, who have a license to dispense it.
				</p>
				<p>
					With more and more children surviving cancer today  it is time for all of us to join hands and lobby our policy makers to ensure  that the rights of people with cancer are not lost sight of as HIV and AIDS  capture the popular imagination. With cancer poised to engulf the developing  world, supporting such an effort is akin to investing in your future.
