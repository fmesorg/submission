					In recent decades, the Indian health sector has seen revolutionary changes. With globalisation, world class technologies, superspeciality
					institutions and big corporate and private sector hospitals have emerged in India. It has also paved the way for
					international collaborations in the field of research, service delivery and health education. However, healthcare still remains beyond
					the reach of the poor and needy in the country. Moreover, the healthcare system is far from achieving the goals of equity and justice.
					The absence of ethics and poor governance contribute significantly to these problems. In this context, the Indian Journal of Medical
					Ethics aims to bring together diverse perspectives on governance in healthcare, towards building an equitable and just health
					system to achieve a productive dialogue between practitioners, administrators, policy-makers and activists by organising the Third
					National Bioethics Conference.
