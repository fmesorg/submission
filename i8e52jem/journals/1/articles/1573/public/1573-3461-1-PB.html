				<h4>A provocative essay</h4>
				<p>
					The essay by Dr Bhatt <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhatt CB. Learning and teaching outside the medical colleges. Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5 : 82-3." id="1">(1)</a> on the need for private coaching classes for medical students, published in  the previous issue of this journal, was probably intended to provoke debate or,  simply, to provoke.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a full-time teacher and one naturally  grieved by the disposition of medical school teachers as portrayed in the  essay, I cannot claim to be an unbiased observer. I am tempted to use this  forum to present another point of view.
				</p>
				<p>
					My first response to the essay was admittedly  reflex. Can anything be permitted in the name of freedom of speech? Should, for  instance, a journal on AIDS publish an essay in praise of free sex? On  regaining composure, realisation dawned that the issue should not be prejudged.  The points raised by Dr Bhatt had to be analysed with due deference.
				</p>

				<h4>Do teachers in medical  colleges ignore teaching?</h4>
				<p>
					The essay justifies  the existence of private coaching classes by stating that 'full-time  teachers are very busy in non-academic and administrative work -- students are  overlooked by them.' It also castigates honorary professors, lecturers and  resident doctors for uniformly 'ignoring students for other pursuits'. I can  speak for resident doctors and lecturers as well, because it is not long ago that  I was in their shoes and still have several of them with me every day. There is  no doubt that all of us have pursuits other than teaching, given the nature of  our jobs as clinicians, teachers, research workers and administrators all  rolled in one. But it never struck teaching me that this was sinful or  necessarily excluded teaching.
				</p>
				<p>
					I must submit that administration (and 'non-academic' work -- whatever that cryptic term means) can sometimes be  overwhelming, but most of us have learnt to accommodate teaching as part of a  busy schedule, with a rigid time-slot kept aside for it. .
				</p>
				<p>
					It needs stating here that private coaching  classes for medical students are also currently run by medical practitioners  busy with private clinics, who also set aside time for teaching, though  obviously for a reward.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem therefore is not in the system  (except that there is no separate monetary gratification for the medical school  teacher who teaches) but in the person. There certainly are black sheep among  these teachers, as in all fields -- the incompetent, the disorganised, the  insincere, the lazy. Dr Bhatt too lends credence to this argument when he  claims that the mess extends across systems (full-time and honorary) and across  the hierarchy. The persons running private coaching classes today are also  products of the same system (there were no coaching classes in their time), and  were obviously exposed to some very good teachers. So what has changed  recently?
				</p>

				<h4>Why have teaching  shops flourished?</h4>
				<p>
					Let us trace the  history of private coaching over the past few years. When we were students in  the 1960s and '7Os, private coaching or tuition catered to the intellectually  challenged. An unstated stigma was attached to those who needed tutors. The  more gifted students attended tutorials only prior to graduation examinations,  more to build up confidence and hone knowledge than to actually acquire it.  Coaching classes, therefore, fulfilled a need.
				</p>
				<p>
					The seeds of corruption were first sown when,  in an attempt to attract more students, coaching classes turned to dubious  means. Insider information about question papers became a selling point. With  the examination-oriented thrust of our education system being a constant  affliction, examination-oriented coaching by any means soon became a coveted  art. While regular schools prepared students for examinations and the life  beyond, coaching classes tookup examinations as their sole goal. It was only a  matter of time before the balance shifted in their favour. Teachers joined  these classes, equally attracted by the monetary gains that came with  commercial success. The process was helped by the crass commercialisation of  the 1980s when money became the sole measure of achievement.
				</p>
				<p>
					The attractions of commercialisation did, of  course, drain schools of teachers. The outside world was attractive, and money  was easy to come by. The rot started in mainstream colleges (where, today,  attendance by students is only to obtain an official entry card to the  examinations) and spread to involve high schools. At last count, junior schools  and even pre- primary schools were being eaten into by parallel coaching  classes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The surprise was that it took so long for the  medical fraternity to get involved. But when it happened, it was quick. In just  about a decade, being a medical school teacher became suspect -- the mark of  someone who would not shine in the world outside. Commercialisation had become  an entity in its own right, and now justified its existence by blaming medical  school teachers. Private coaching classes evolved from fulfilling a need to  creating one -- a success story that Dalal Street would do well to study.

				<h4>Ward-less teaching</h4>
				<p>
					Having put history in  perspective, let's take up a few more of the points raised in Dr Bhatt's essay. Dr Bhatt is correct when he states that many private medical colleges have no  infrastructure for teaching. But, weren't these 'colleges' started during the  same period as the coaching classes to latch on to the bandwagon of commercial  gain? Aren't they, themselves, more 'coaching classes' than conventional  medical schools and financially successful for the same reason?
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Bhatt may also be correct, to an extent, in  stating that students in medical colleges find it difficult to refer to  journals because of their ward postings.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was brought up on the dictum that teaching  at the bedside, in the ward, was the essence of clinical medicine, something  that coaching classes do not offer in any case. Neither do they offer journals;  they offer instead one or more teachers' interpretations of literature. It is  ironic that students do not have time for journals but can spend late hours in  coaching classes. At least medical colleges have libraries, though of course  only for students who can organise their time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Bhatt is right when he states that 'coaching  and private tuition are very common... in the present milieu' and that students  'at times (pay) sizeable sums for it.' The lay press in the country has  recently shown concern on this issue, and probably will awaken the authorities  to corrective action.

				<h4>Foul incentives</h4>
				<p>
					Under the title  'teaching techniques used in private coaching', Dr Bhatt lists ideal techniques  mentioned in literature. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nayar U, Adkoli BV. Standardisation of techniques for  imparting skills to doctors. In: Souvenir. New Delhi: Medical Council of India, 1997, May 20-21." id="2">(2</a>, <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Krishna Rao A. Science and technology of medical education  transfer of knowledge and teaching techniques." id="3">3)</a> Quoting the scriptures does not alter realities  on the ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					If everything was so picture-perfect, many  coaching classes would not have to fall back on the old incentives (insider  information on question papers), now upgraded to include guaranteed success,  and distinctions in the subject of your choice. But that is another story.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Bhatt lists computers, video cassettes,  projectors (all of which are also now easily available in regular medical  colleges) and computerised notes as techniques in coaching classes --  prominently leaving out the bedside for the medical college. In coaching  classes, medical teaching has come a long way from the time when it revolved  around the patient.
				</p>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Medical colleges and  private coaching classes are not necessarily in a 'this-town-is-too-small-for-both-of-us' situation. It need not be one or the  other. It is not necessary to have to condemn one to justify the existence of  the other. Remember that the clientele of coaching classes today is restricted  to undergraduate students. Postgraduate and postdoctoral students are still  doing fine in these same medical colleges with the same teachers. (This is not  an invitation to spread tentacles to them as well!). It is not so much teaching  that is lacking in medical colleges as teaching for marks at examinations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mainline medical colleges have come to stay  all over the world without the assistance of private coaching classes. It may  be appropriate for coaching classes to return to their original role of helping  those who are disadvantaged.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a call to arrest the bleed by putting  heads together to identify and solve genuine problems. Problems undoubtedly  exist in medical colleges, as Dr Bhatt amply stated. Irrespective of whether  these are the origin or the consequence, there is no winner-take-all in this  dispute.
