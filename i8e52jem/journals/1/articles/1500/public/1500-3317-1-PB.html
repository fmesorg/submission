					There is a history behind the "cross practice" controversy,  writes Arun Bal.

				<p>
					The recent decision of the government of Maharashtra to allow  doctors trained in homeopathy to prescribe allopathic medicines has created an  intense controversy. This issue has been raised a number of times in the last  few years because of various government decisions and court judgements.  However, the debate has been conducted in a manner that is detrimental to the  common man's interests, and beneficial only to political vested interests.
				</p>

				<p>
					The current debate centres around the question of whether homeopathic doctors  should be allowed to use allopathic medicines or, put differently, whether "cross  practice" is ethical and legal. In my opinion, the only relevant questions are  whether every citizen has a right to health care, and whether it is ethical or  legal to deprive citizens of health care facilities. In order to answer this  question, it is necessary to review government and legal decisions in the light  of developments in the field of health care over the last 50 years.

				<h4>The Bhore Committee</h4>
				<p>
					At the time of Independence, 90 percent of the population of India was  rural. Diseases like malaria were major killers. The government appointed a  committee, which came to be known as the Bhore Committee, to present a  programme for the health care system of independent India. The Bhore Committee  went into details of various aspects of the country's health care needs. Its  report contained many practical and valuable recommendations. One of the  recommendations relevant to the issue under discussion was to change the  pattern of medical education to suit the needs of the country. The committee  also stated that independent India needed "socially committed" doctors and  recommended that all inexpensive but useful therapies in the various  disciplines practiced in the country be incorporated into the medical education  system. (It is worth noting that two members of the committee, who were  doctors, appended a dissenting note, stating that the "socially committed  doctor" envisaged by the committee would create destitution amongst doctors.  The seeds of the present sad scenario in health care were probably sown at the  time the Bhore Committee's report was written.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Though the government accepted the report, the critical recommendation relating  to medical education was not implemented. The Indian National Congress had also  appointed a parallel committee to formulate health care services in independent  India. This committee, the Sokhey Committee, also recommended the integration  of medical education. However, in 1946 a Health Ministers conference took the  decision to appoint yet another committee, this one to recommend various  measures to develop the Indian systems of medicine. This committee, the Chopra  Committee, also recommended the integration of modern and indigenous systems of  medicine. The committee recommended that indigenous medicine graduates undergo  six month training programmes in modern medicine for practice at the primary  health care level.

				<h4>Different states, different courses.</h4>
				<p>
					In 1956 the government appointed the Dave Committee in the face of demands for  integrated medical education. This committee recommended a five-and-half-year  graduate course in integrated medicine. However, this recommendation was not  accepted by all states, as a result of which different states developed  different courses. Around this time, the government created the Central Council  for Indian Medicine which was supposed to regulate various indigenous  disciplines.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Bhore and Sokhey Committees' recommendation for the creation of a single,  unified course integrating all useful indigenous elements remained  un-implemented. This created a multiplicity of courses . It also created  different classes of medical professionals.
				</p>

				<h4>Private medical colleges</h4>
				<p>
					The situation has become more chaotic in the last  15 years with the creation of private medical colleges. Almost all these  medical colleges are owned by politicians. Instead of becoming part of the  health care infrastructure, medical colleges have become a source of political  and financial power for various political interests. Many of these medical  colleges were started without any infrastructure, and the education imparted in  these colleges is substandard. However, they charge exorbitant capitation fees.  The medical graduates of this colleges are poorly trained and more inclined to  practice in urban areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					The large-scale use of allopathic medicines by these doctors, without training,  led to a hue and cry. This prompted some state governments to issue a  notification under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act (Section 2) permitting the use  of allopathic medicines by non-allopathic medical graduates. The Supreme Court,  in Ashwin Patel v/s Poonam Verma, decided that practicing any type of medicine  without the requisite knowledge and qualification would amount to "negligence  per se" and described it as quackery. This prompted some FDA authorities to  issue orders preventing chemists from selling allopathic drugs when prescribed  by non-allopathic doctors. This led to another round of court cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					The issue was finally decided by the Supreme Court in 1998.  In Dr. Muktiar Chand v/s State of Punjab, the court upheld the validity of the  notification under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. However, the court placed a  different interpretation on the CCIM resolution of 1987 which allowed the  non-allopathic curricula to include modern medicines. The court decided this  resolution only allowed practitioners in non-allopathic disciplines to use  modern investigations like X-rays, MRI scans, etc. This interpretation of the  resolution is technical and the court failed to take into account the overall  ground level situation. Therefore, the court decision has further complicated  the situation.

				<h4>"Cross practice" is inevitable</h4>
				<p>
					The ideal doctor-patient ratio recommended by  Bhore Committee was 1: 2,500. At present this ratio is 1: 300 for urban areas  and 1: 900 for rural areas. In urban areas only 30 per cent doctors are  allopaths. This percentage is as low as 10 per cent in some rural areas. Most  of the rural population has to depend on nonallopathic doctors for their health  care needs. The government health care infrastructure caters to only 25 per  cent of the population. Under these circumstances, "cross practice" is  inevitable. People have to go to non-allopathic doctors for injuries,  inoculations, snake bites, etc., for which non-allopathic disciplines have no  effective therapy. Preventing a homeopath from administering a tetanus toxoid  injection because homeopathy does not include injections would amount to  depriving a patient of essential health care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The prevalent situation is the outcome of the mismanagement and wrong policies  of the last 50 years. The solutions offered by the government and the medical  profession in this debate are ad hoc and do not take into account the needs of  the people and the evolution of health care services over the decades. The  health parameters of our country are still dismal. The infant mortality rate is  still much above the 21/1,000 live births which had been agreed upon as a  target for Health for All by 2000 AD. Incidentally, one of the recommendations  of the Alma Ata conference was to integrate various indigenous disciplines to  achieve its goal of Health for All.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan envisaged by the Bhore Committee and the Sokhey  Committee for the medical education pattern in India is the real solution. To  fulfill the needs of the population, an integrated approach to the health care  is required. The present crisis should be tackled in stages. In the first  stage, primary health care needs to be strengthened by creating a cadre of  health workers, or, as envisaged by the Chopra Committee, by training  non-allopathic doctors working in the rural areas in essential modern medicine according  to the WHO's list of essential drugs. Health care workers and non-allopathic  doctors should be allowed to use drugs which are essential for primary health  care needs. A broad consensus can be evolved about the number and type of  drugs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the second stage, within a specified time, a  graduate-level integrated course in medicine should be started. This course  should be designed according to the original recommendations of the Bhore  Committee. Pure ayurvedic, unani, homeopathic education should be offered only  as post-graduate education.
				</p>

				<h4>Medicine for financial gain</h4>
				<p>
					However, this will require tremendous political  will. It is doubtful whether the present political leadership of any political  party has this will. Moreover, medicine is being viewed by politicians as an  avenue for political and financial gains. The best example of this is the  formation of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences. In spite of the  recommendations of various committees against a unified centralised system of  medical education, the government has gone ahead with the formation of this  university. Similarly, the decision of the government of Maharashtra against  "cross practice" applies only to homeopathy graduates. Thus, graduates of other  indigenous disciplines have not been included. Further, the list of drugs which  these graduates are permitted to use is drawn without any scientific basis.  This will start another round of court cases.
				</p>

				<p>
					The solution to the present crisis has more to do with politics and people than  medicine and doctors. The courts cannot solve this problem. Every court case  makes the problem more complicated, leading to more ad hoc decisions. Every  citizen of this country has a right to health care. This right may not be  legally absolute. However, it is part of every human's right. Any system,  regulation or law which deprives people of their right to health care needs to  be changed. The need of the hour is to make health a political subject and  revamp the medical education system completely, instead of offering piecemeal  solutions like the Maharashtra government's order.
