				<h4>Assessment of disability</h4>
				<p>
					Thank you for publishing the review by Dr. Sanjay Nagral of the book on assessment of disabilities. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral Sanjay: Review of Impairments, disabilities and their assessment. Issues in Medical Ethics 1997; 5: 101" id="1">(1)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Nagral has raised a doubt on the legality of assessment of disablement as per the criteria given in this book. The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1923, in its section 4-1-C-(ii), has clearly explained that the disabilities not covered by Schedule I given in the Act are to be considered as per the assessment of the doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Schedule I covers amputations, disablements due to total deafness and so on. It does not cover disablements due to other diseases or orthopaedic complications which are not amputations. For such disablements, section 4-1-C (ii) clearly states that the doctor's assessment is legally valid
				</p>
				<p>
					The explanation provided for this section further states that while assessing disablement not given in Schedule I, qualified medical practitioners should have due regard for Schedule I. This is understandable.
				</p>
				<p>
					Total amputation of the thumb warrants 30% disability in Schedule I. In case of deformity of the thumb following an accident, the assessing doctor will have to bear in mind this limit of 30% for total amputation. If deformity is associated with loss of strength, restriction of movement or other factors that make the thumb useless, a maximum disability of 30% can be granted. As long as Schedule I is respected and as long as there is a rational basis for assessing disability, legality is not in doubt. In the book under review, we have discussed Schedule I and have tried to provide a rational basis for assessment.
