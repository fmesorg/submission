					Kay Redifield Jamison. <em>An unquiet mind: a memoir of moods and madness.</em> Picador, 1996. &#163;7.99, pp224.  ISBN 0-330-34651-2
				</p>
				<p>
					This  remarkable book is a description of manic-depressive illness (the author  prefers this name to 'bipolar disorder') related by a person who not only has  the disease but is a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. She  is therefore able to look at her illness from both an objective and subjective  point of view. Her remarkable writing abilities and clear scientific mind  coupled with a wonderful sensitivity make this an engrossing book for any  reader.

					In the  recent past, the plight of economically weak psychiatric patients in India was  brought into public focus when, in Erwadi in Tamil Nadu, a number of patients  who were being cared for in a makeshift private home died in a fire. The  patients could not escape because they were chained.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients  with major psychiatric disorders are often disruptive. They lack the usual  inhibitions and therefore place a tremendous strain on their families. The  author was relatively fortunate in having a family who could and did (and do)  support her. She is also obviously extremely intelligent and motivated and was  able to get control of her illness. She does not spare herself when she  describes the effects of manic-depressive illness. In a more general way she  describes what a major psychiatric illness can mean:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>No  amount of psychotherapy, education, persuasion, or coercion worked; ...no  tallying up of the hospitalizations, broken relationships, financial disasters,  lost jobs, imprisonments, squanderings of a good, creative, and educated mind  worked...He had a terrible disease and it eventually cost him his life.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					She makes it clear that caring for a patient with major psychiatric illness is  extremely difficult. In India, where public psychiatric institutions are few  and far between, individual families often have to take care of the patients.  Considering the tremendous effort involved, it is not surprising that they take  recourse to private facilities such as those at Erwadi. The results are often  tragic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The author describes many dilemmas that a patient with psychiatric illness has  to confront. For example, she had to debate whether to reveal her illness to  potential employers. She also had to consider whether to reveal it to the men  she was dating.
				</p>
				<p>
					She  candidly describes the reservations that some colleagues have on knowing about  her illness. Psychiatric illness, more than physical ailments, seems to evoke  certain emotions all over the world. Some people, including medical  practitioners, believe that the patient can overcome the illness by willpower  alone. They believe that an illness of the mind is just being 'weak'. This,  despite the clear evidence for the biochemical basis of many of the disorders,  and the highly effective therapies that exist. This prejudice often means that  the patients get less than effective care.
				</p>
				<p>
					The drug lithium which she takes to control her illness, though highly  effective, also has unfortunate side-effects. The side-effects are one of the  main reasons that make patients 'non-compliant', i.e. stop taking the  medication. The disastrous consequences of stopping medication are vividly  described. It needs a lot of effort on the part of caregivers as well as the  patient to keep taking the medication. It is a moot point how many families  can, by themselves, devote the time and resources necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is obvious that a lot of cooperative social action is necessary to  adequately care for people with major psychiatric illness. India is woefully  short of such facilities. Tragedies such as those at Erwadi are always waiting  to happen.
