				<h4>Medical help for victims of  violence in Gujarat</h4>
				<p>
					I want to appeal to all of you to take up the issue  of denial / apathy by Gujarat state machinery to provide medical help / care to  riot victims. Thousands of Muslims are suffering as they are not provided with  any medical care by state nor can they approach private carers as they are  certain they will be turned away. They are extremely scared to approach public  health services as they fear they will be killed. Reports indicate that Hindu  doctors are 'warned' not to cater to Muslim patients. This is a gross violation  of human rights. Are there any international norms regarding victims of  communal violence that ensure right to health care? Gujarat is worse than that  as it is clearly a case of ethnic cleansing.
