				<h4>We don't need corporate sponsorship for education</h4>
				<p>
				I draw  your attention to a notice in the publication <em>Asian Cardiovascular and Thoracic  Annals</em> (1998; VI (4): 26A- 27A), announcing the details of a new 'educational  programme' in cardiovascular surgery to improve capability in India and China  for open heart surgery, cardiovascular anaesthesia, perfusion and critical care  nursing. Interestingly this programme is initiated by M/s Baxter Health Care  Asia Pvt Ltd, a multinational corporation based in the USA. </p>
				<p>
					The  programme does not involve any university, in India or abroad. Nor does this  programme mention affiliation to national educational bodies like the Medical  Council of India (MCI) or the National Board of Examinations (NBE). Some  private institutions - corporate or non- government organisations - may be participating  in this so - called training programme. I wonder on whose demand the training  programme was initiated and whether any national interests were considered  before such programme was started. Today this is being done for cardiology and  cardiac surgery. Tomorrow this could spread to other specialties as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of  us in the medical profession in India are students of Indian medical schools,  though some of us have also had some training abroad, in well- established and  renowned medical educational institutes. There are many teaching institutions  in India which impart firstrate training in cardiac surgery and other branches  of medicine to young doctors. It is with the help of our own medical and  surgical fraternity that we have been able to develop so far. Our aim certainly  should be to strengthen our own teaching and training programmes. For this we  do not have to take the support of any multinational corporate  industrial/bsiness organisation, which usually has its own interest in taking  up such programmes. This can land us in difficulties, for the nation as a whole  and in particular the 70 per cent of our population in the villages.
				</p>
				<p>
					One  cannot deny that there is much scope for improvement at all levels the  university, MCI, NBE, teaching and training institutions. However, this does  not mean that somebody from abroad -- and that too an industrial organisation  -- has to come here to take up such programmes without the permission of the  government of India and the organisations which control the teaching and  training of medical professionals. It is high time that the MCI, NBE and  medical schools came together and had a thorough discussion of our problems so  that we can improve ourselves without interference from outside. At the most we  can take help of some teaching and training institutions abroad. There is no  reason why this should not be possible provided we have the will, sincerity and  honesty. After all, we have demonstrated this in many fields.
				</p>
				<p>
					My  earnest appeal is that we should nip the problem in the bud.
