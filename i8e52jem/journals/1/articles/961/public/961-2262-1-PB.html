				<h4>Junagadh blood bank scandal</h4>
				<p>
					The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating a   horrifying case of criminal negligence in Junagadh, Gujarat, where 23   thalassaemic children contracted HIV due to contaminated blood   transfusions in 2011. The Junagarh government hospital did not screen   the blood for HIV. The blood was obtained from the Sarvoday Blood Bank   headed by BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo. The blood bank was listed on the   state government's official website in spite of being unregistered.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first investigation, by Junagadh Superintendent of Police,   Shobha Bhutada, was found unsatisfactory, and the Gujarat High Court   ordered a CBI probe after the parents of the children filed a public   interest litigation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Observing that "no effective steps were taken during five months   of [the police] probe and the system seemed supporting the private blood   bank, which did not even have a license", the High Court asked the CBI   to investigate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, causing hurt   by means of poison, and abetment, were some of the charges filed by the   Gujarat police, and retained by the CBI. Among those charged are the   civil surgeon and pathology department officials of the hospital. Two of   the children have since died.

				<h4>Rotavirus vaccine in immunisation programme?</h4>
				<p>
					Medical experts have criticised the government's plans to include   the rotavirus vaccine in the national childhood immunisation programme.   They argue that available evidence does not support use of the expensive   vaccine in a national programme, and doing so will divert funds from   other urgently required interventions. Two noted paediatricians, Jacob   Puliyel of St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi, and Joseph Mathew of the   Advanced Paediatric Centre, PGIMER, Chandigarh, have argued their case   in the <em>British Medical Journal</em>. They have also criticised the   evidence and calculations that are used to justify the vaccine's   inclusion in a national programme. For one, data from other countries   are not necessarily applicable in India. Second, the vaccine does not   prevent bacterial infection. Third, most rotavirus diarrheoa cases are   "co-infections" for which the vaccine will be of no use. Finally, the   Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation supports immunisation   campaigns initially and later backs out. This leaves developing   countries to foot the bill for expensive vaccines. India's immunisation   budget is $240 million; the rotavirus vaccine alone is said to cost $   350 million.

				<h4>Death by negligence</h4>
				<p>
					A string of acts of suspected medical negligence is being   investigated by a three-member commission looking into the death of   65-year old Bhikhu Tambe at the government-run Gokuldas Tejpal (GT)   Hospital in Mumbai.
				</p>
				<p>
					The patient was initially admitted to St George's Hospital (also   government-run) on December 4, 2012, complaining of breathlessness. He   was referred to GT Hospital for a pulmonary CT angiography, as doctors   suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to press reports, the patient died about an hour after   undergoing the angiography at GT Hospital, but doctors from St George's   Hospital took charge of the body and transferred it to their own   hospital where they put the body on a ventilator for over two hours,   before finally announcing  the patient's death to his family.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is alleged that the patient was sent alone to GT Hospital for   the angiography despite being in obvious distress; he was kept waiting   outside the imaging centre; his death was intentionally concealed from   his family by using a resuscitator and ventilator after he had been   declared dead; and no post mortem had been conducted before handing over   the body to relatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The committee is investigating all these charges, as also the   possibility of the patient's death being caused by a reaction to a dye   used for the purpose of the scan; or by an injection which was given to check a reaction to the dye.

				<h4>Need to preserve privacy in facilities for the HIV- positive</h4>
				<p>
					Thousands of HIV- positive individuals in India must travel long   distances for essential antiretroviral therapy (ART) provided by the   government. It is for this reason that, two years ago, the Tamil Nadu   government launched a scheme providing free bus passes for travel to ART   centres. Yet there are few takers for the essential facility.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is because the special passes, which sport a red ribbon logo,   and contain details of the patients' treatment centre, are used by nosy   conductors to harass pass holders, often in a bus full of their   neighbours. Patients, who are already travelling long distances,   spending more than they can afford to avoid recognition, find the   government's gesture costly. Rights activists have asked for awareness   raising among transport staff. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation   authorities state that a circular has been issued to service staff on   the matter, but this has not made any difference.

				<h4>Irish law on abortion to be amended</h4>
				<p>
					The Irish Government has announced plans to amend the law on   abortion, and permit it as a last resort, "where there is a real and   substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of the woman".   This is in response to widespread popular protest after the death of   Indian-born Savita Halappanawar of septicaemia related to a miscarriage.    Savita was refused an abortion when her baby was miscarrying,   apparently on the ground that the foetus' heart was still beating. Her   husband reported that staff told him an abortion was not permissible as   "Ireland was a Catholic country".
				</p>
				<p>
					Abortion is banned in Ireland in all circumstances. Though the   country's Supreme Court permitted it in the case of a 14-year-old rape   victim, when the woman's life was at risk, including from suicide; the   legislation does not reflect this decision. It is, however, embodied in   the Irish Medical Council's guidance on the issue: "Abortion is illegal   in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life   (as distinct from the health) of the mother. Under current legal   precedent, this exception includes where there is a clear and   substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of   suicide."
				</p>
				<p>
					Critics have accused the government of "shirking its responsibility to provide legislative clarity on the issue".

            <h4>Horrific gang rape stimulates debate </h4>
            <p>
			  <em><strong>The brutal gang rape and torture of the young medical   student in Delhi, followed by her death, aroused an unprecedented storm   of public protest, and debate in the media. Some of the issues raised   were amendments in the law on rape and other forms of oppression of   women; how far the police and other authorities implement the existing   laws; the punishment and demands for its revision; and the cultural   mindset that allows oppressors to get away with impunity, encouraging a   repetition of such crimes. Some reports covering these issues are   summarised below: </strong></em></p>
	    
				<h5>Doctors question ethics of airlifting patient</h5>
				<p>
					"The shifting of the victim who had suffered irreversible brain   damage, after two consequent cardiac arrests and septicemia was   ethically and morally wrong," said Dr Deepak Agarwal, senior   neurosurgeon at the AIIMS trauma centre. He dismissed the government's   claims that Mount Elizabeth Hospital was selected as it has a   state-of-the-art organ transplant facility. "The fact is a patient with   two cardiac arrests and septicemia cannot undergo transplant. She was at   best an organ donor not a recipient," said Agarwal. However, Dr Yatin   Mehta, chairman of the Medanta Institute of Critical Care and   Anesthesiology, said the patient "was flown to Singapore in a last-ditch   attempt to try and revive her in a set-up that was far better than   Safdarjung Hospital."
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, a senior doctor at Safdarjung Hospital told the   newspaper that the shifting was done under "direction from the top   (government)". He added that the patient had suffered irreversible brain   damage in the early hours of Wednesday, 22 hours before she was   airlifted to Singapore.
				</p>
				<p>
					This criticism was echoed by the Indian Medical Association (IMA)   President, Dr K Vijaykumar, who told the press that a doubt arises in   everyone's mind whether the country's premier institutes and hospitals   lack the infrastructure to treat such patients. Both the President and   Honorary Secretary of the IMA demanded that the government come out with   criteria and norms to be followed with regard to cases of transfer of   patients to other hospitals. Several members of the profession have   questioned the shifting, with some directly stating that it was a   political move.

				<h4>NGO recommends strict implementation of current laws</h4>
				<p>
					In an analysis of rape cases in the Delhi district courts, Shakti   Vahini, an NGO, found that poor investigation led to a large number of   acquittals. Executive Director Ravi Kant said: "Changes in legislation   or enhancing the punishment is not the answer, but the proper   implementation of current laws and making the system efficient is."   Among the major lacunae revealed are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The accused were arrested, released on bail, and then went missing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Persons who provide surety for bail for the rape accused are only fined if the accused abscond.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inadequate protection to witnesses and victims prompted them to turn hostile.
					</li>
					<li>
						In some cases, no effort was made to involve vital witnesses in the trial.
					</li>
					<li>
						Evidence related to important events which form a part and parcel   of the crime was routinely overlooked by investigating officers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Medical examinations of victims were conducted after the stipulated limit, rendering the evidence invalid.

				<h4>Revamping the "justice" system</h4>
				<p>
					Much debate on the case has centred on increasing the quantum of   punishment, and the infrastructure in the justice system. An article by   Indira Jaising, Additional Solicitor General of India, discusses what   needs to be done to revamp the legal system. Some of her observations:
				</p>
			  <ul>
					<li>
						For a man to rape his wife is not an offence, as her consent is assumed in marriage. This is where the problem starts
					</li>
					<li>
						The principle that sexual intercourse without consent is   unacceptable, whether it is with a wife or a stranger needs to be   established.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is the impunity with which vested interests abuse the law,   and the complete indifference to women who have been sexually abused,   that result in delays, not the lack of infrastructure. An approximately   40% increase in the number of judges between 2005 and 2012 did not   produce a corresponding reduction in the number of pending cases.
					</li>
					<li>
						Though at least 50% of law students are women, a patriarchal   judiciary and legal system ensure that the number of women lawyers and   judges is low. Even this minority is discriminated against in terms of   appointments, designation as seniors and promotions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Under the existing law, a man found guilty of rape can be given a   life sentence. Ms Jaising points out that in her entire career of over   40 years as a lawyer, she has not seen a single case where a rapist has   been given a life sentence.
					</li>
					<li>
						For increased accountability of the police, a complaints   procedure needs to be set up where a complaint can be lodged for   non-performance of duties. When the non-performance of duties involves a   junior, the senior officer must be made accountable. When the   non-performance emerges as a trend, the accountability must be that of   the head of the police, and of the political establishment.
					</li>
					<li>
						The performance of the judiciary should also be monitored, and a   mechanism be set up to examine whether the content of their judgments   meets the constitutional goal of equality.
					</li>
					<li>
						Standards must be put in place as to how judges should behave   with women lawyers and litigants. No judge, let alone a Supreme Court   judge, must ever be permitted to use sexist language in judgements or   during proceedings in court.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Ms Jaising concludes: </h5>
				<p>
					"This is what the 23-year-old was trying to tell us, before she   died.  "I want to live," she said, not die of shame. She changed the way   society looks at rape from blaming the victim to focusing on the   rapist. All law reform must move in that direction, asking how we can   build a new life-sustaining legal culture, a more equal culture, with   justice for all."

					<h4>Chemical castration cannot be a penalty option</h4>
					<p>
						Among the early responses to the murderous assault on the young   student in Delhi, have been demands for surgical castration, chemical   castration and the death penalty for rape. A lead article in <em>The Hindu</em> argues that the demand for chemical castration "is largely misplaced   because it misunderstands the nature of rape as a crime. Rape is not   about sex. Rape is about power, violence, intimidation and humiliation.   Attempts to reduce the incidence of rape by controlling the sexual urge   of men are bound to be ineffective because they invoke a very shallow   and inadequate understanding of rape."
					</p>
					<p>
						Explaining that "Chemical castration involves injecting   anti-androgen drugs that suppress the production of testosterone as long   as the drugs are administered", the author says the therapy, which is   reversible when discontinued, "would require state governments to put in   place a strictly implemented system of providing therapy for it to be a   constitutional option. Given the condition of state healthcare services   in India, citizens are entitled to be sceptical about the feasibility   of providing such therapy." Again "a law that would require indefinite   administration of anti-androgens for sex offenders is likely to be   unconstitutional".
					</p>
					<p>
						No meaningful attempt to protect women from sexual oppression can   succeed without striving to change "gendered notions of power entrenched   in our families, our marriages, our workplaces, our educational   institutions, our religions, our laws, our political parties and,   perhaps, worst of all, in our minds. There are many violent   manifestations of these entrenched patterns of power in our society and   while rape is certainly one of them, it would be a great disservice to   empowerment of women in this country to not attach the same kind of   urgency and significance to gender violence beyond rape," the writer   concludes.
