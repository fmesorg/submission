					Resident doctors of  public hospitals in Mahaharashtra were on strike again, demanding parity in  their stipend with other states. This was their sixth strike in two decades.  The usual pattern is that the strike is carried forward for two to three weeks  and then withdrawn in the face of government coercion. The government does  little to prevent such strikes, or to hold any meaningful discussion with the  agitators once they begin. This is primarily because the people affected by the  strike are poor and unorganised, and cannot put much pressure on the  government. Also, the public's health is a low priority for all political  parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resident doctors make up the backbone of public hospitals affiliated to  teaching hospitals, and the government's assertion that the strike did not  affect services in these hospitals is completely false. Resident doctors are  post-graduate medical students who work as resident doctors as a part of their  post-graduation. Keen on completing their post-graduate studies, they are  usually up-to-date on recent developments in their subject. They are  responsible for the efficient work culture and relatively high quality patient  care in these hospitals &mdash; a contrast to district hospitals with facilities  similar to teaching hospitals but with full-time doctors who are government  employees.

				<h4>Demands justified</h4>
				<p>
					There is a big gap in the stipend paid by the government of Maharashtra and  that paid by other states. The government expects resident doctors to work 24  hours a day without the protection of any service rules because they are  students. At the same time, it charges them hefty teaching fees for post-graduate courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government also argues that resident doctors in Bombay are working in the  best hospitals in the country, and will go on to earn lakhs in their private  practices based on the experience they receive at these hospitals. This 'good  will' justifies the low stipend that they receive. The government's  contribution towards this 'good will' is zero.
				</p>
				<p>
					Resident doctors in Maharashtra work and live in abysmal conditions which are  bound to affect patient care adversely. In times of medical crisis, they must  depend on archaic communication systems. Discharge cards are still hand  written, though computerising the record system would save significant time for  patient care. Essentially, the government has always looked upon resident  doctors as cheap labour for its public teaching hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					In short, the demands of resident doctors in Maharashtra were justified.
				</p>

				<h4>Why the strikes fail</h4>
				<p>
					However, resident doctors have failed to garner public support for any  of their strikes in the last 25 years. The reasons: the inherent weakness of  the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) as an organisation whose  members and leadership change every three years, and the lack of social  awareness about the critical role that resident doctors play in public teaching  hospitals. The government has always exploited these facts to break the strike.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both MARD and the medical profession at large have failed to create public  awareness about the importance of resident doctors for public teaching  hospitals. The medical profession's general lack of political awareness  contributes significantly to the current situation. The main demand in  residents' strikes has always been monetary. Instead, the focus of any  negotiation should be the poor working conditions which affect patient care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any strike by health professionals which deprives people of basic care is  unethical. MARD should have allied with other medical and social organisations  to lobby the government, negotiate and arrive at an amicable solution. They  should also have focused on the trends in health care responsible for the  situation today.

				<h4>Trends in public health</h4>
				<p>
					Investment in the care of seriously-ill patients as a percentage of investment  in public health has been decreasing over the years, particularly after the  World Bank / IMF's structural adjustment programme pushed for privatisation of  the public health system. The Maharshtra government's recent Rs 771 crore loan  from the World Bank to modernise the district and sub-district level health-care system is conditional on starting user fees and increasing the involvement  of the private sector in the public health system. The government has already  announced that private doctors will be hired on contract to improve the  functioning of public hospitals. It is surrendering public hospitals to private  medical colleges which don't have a hospital of their own, in order that these  understaffed institutions run by politicians meet the Medical Council of  India's requirements. Finally, the entry of private health insurance companies  is likely to reduce the importance of public teaching hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					While these trends are not directly related to the resident doctors' strike,  the government is likely to use the strike as a excuse to take privatisation  one step further. Its move to reduce the importance of resident doctors by  reducing the seats for open category post-graduate registration, reserving  some for full-time government doctors, will, in the long run, adversely affect  patient care in public hospitals. Neither MARD nor other professional  organisations in the state have taken note of this fact.
				</p>
				<p>
					National standardisation of stipends to post-graduate students and resident  doctors is unlikely unless the medical profession realises the political and  social implications of health care privatisation and joins hands with like  minded organisations to create public awareness on the issue. Such public  protest &mdash; with the support of professional organisations &mdash; forced the British  government to abandon similar plans in some National Health Service hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					The recent resident doctors' strike in Maharashtra is a symptom of a crumbling  public health system. The medical profession's ignorance of this fact will only  help the government break the strikes.
