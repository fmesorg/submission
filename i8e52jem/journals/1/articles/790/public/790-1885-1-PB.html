					The Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies (AMCHSS), Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical
					Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Thiruvananthapuram is conducting a study on the nature and extent of
					sexual harassment that occurs in work settings among readers of the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics.</em> This study
					is being conducted by the Gender in Medical Education Project of the AMCHSS, SCTIMST, Thiruvananthapuram
					and is being facilitated by the <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics,</em> through the <em>Journal</em> and its web site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The principal investigators for this study are Dr Mala Ramanathan, Associate Professor, AMCHSS, SCTIMST,
					Dr R Sukanya, independent researcher, and Dr Sankara Sarma, additional professor, AMCHSS, SCTIMST.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participation in this study involves answering a small questionnaire relating to any incident of sexual harassment in
					the workplace (in India) that you have experienced or witnessed during the past one year. By sexual harassment in
					the workplace we mean:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						(Unwelcome) physical contact and advances
					</li>
					<li>
						Demand or request for sexual favours
					</li>
					<li>
						Sexually coloured remarks
					</li>
					<li>
						Display of pornography
					</li>
					<li>
						Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					(Vishaka and others v. State of Rajasthan [1997 6 SCC 241; AIR 1997 SC 3011])
				</p>
				<p>
					Answering these questions may cause you to recall memories of events that have painful connotations either for you or for
					others close to you. However, responding to this survey will not require you to give us your name or the name of the
					institutions to which you are attached/attended. This process will help in obtaining information that will throw light on
					a socially unacceptable practice that affects the well-being of both men and women.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are willing to participate in this study, please find attached a small questionnaire (see page 46) that you can fill
					in, cut and mail to the following address:

					<em>(Photocopies of the questionnaire will also be accepted.)</em>
				</p>

					In view of the voluntary nature of this survey, we are not attaching a stamped, self-addressed envelope but hope that
					you will bear the cost of mailing the response back to us. Alternatively, if you have access to the Internet, please visit
					the web site of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics at www.issuesinmedicalethics.org to fill in the same and submit,
					thus maintaining anonymity.
