				<h4>Education without  sponsorship</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Excerpts  from a letter to the president of the Poladpur Medical Association, Poladpur,  Raigad, Maharashtra:</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					I was  impressed by the 80 per cent attendance for my talk on how to start and continue CPR or initial management of cardiac  arrest in a rural area. Until now, I have attended more than 50 CMEs, but not a  single one was arranged without sponsorship... It was really creditable on the  part of doctors practising in remote rural areas, where they are the backbone  of rural health care, because in today's era, everything from tea to the toilet  is sponsored. I noticed that everybody was taking a keen interest in the  lecture...because their minds were not at all diverted as routinely happens in  a sponsored conference due to stalls and other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sir, I admire you  and your members for the way they have adapted for learning and avoiding  becoming slaves of sponsorship. I hope this message is conveyed to all  presidents and officials who are putting their major energy into searching for  sponsors for medical CMEs.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yours sincerely,
				</p>
