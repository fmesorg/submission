				<p>
					This theme issue of the  Journal of Medical Ethics deals with ethical challenges in organ transplants.  The following articles are of particular interest:
				</p>
				<p>
					This article describes  the differences between non-heart beating dead donor and heart beating dead  donor protocols and argues for defining death when irreversible asystole  occurs, with the open admission that it does not define 'death' but only a  moment in the process of dying when organ retrieval can be allowed.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					The author argues that  the definition of brain death should be based on 'the irreversible loss of  consciousness, which causes an irreversible absence of the capacity for  integrating the main human attributes with a functioning body'. It should be  considered separately from organ transplants.
				</p>
				<p>
					In reply, Kerridge et al  say that it is only where vital organs are sought that a diagnosis of brain  death is required, and it has been necessary to legitimise the process of  'donation'. The 'dead donor rule' should be replaced with a 'good as dead donor  rule' so that the process of 'donation' and transplantation becomes more honest  and transparent.

				<p>
					The author presents  arguments on why it is morally unjustifiable to increase the supply of organs  for transplantation by a policy giving the sick a right to cadaveric organs.  Instead he proposes a model of organ donation as a form of giving back  something to the community from which one has benefited. This action is not  obligatory but supererogatory&mdash;beyond the call of duty.

				<p>
					Mandated choice for  organ donation respects individual autonomy more than any of the other  strategies. The authors propose using the Spanish model where transplant  coordinators are charged with gaining the consent of relatives for organ  donation by persuasion if necessary. Individuals who choose not to donate need  not justify their decision in a public investigation.

					The author points out  that the act of asking a patient or relative for organ donation puts an immense  emotional demand on the doctor who is designated to do so. Acknowledging this  as an altruistic act, rather than dismissing it as part of their job, will  support and encourage the doctors.

					In a well-known British  case, the relatives of a dead man consented to the use of his organs for  transplant on the condition that they were transplanted only into white people.  The British government panel condemned all conditional offers of donation and  appealed to a principle of altruism and meeting the greatest need. This paper  criticises their reasoning saying that while this racist condition was wrong,  all conditions are not necessarily so.

					The authors propose a  market in organs from living donors.

					An article on the ethics  of intimate examinations without consent attracted powerful comment. This  summary of rapid responses to the article notes that almost all those who  mentioned it said that it was unethical and must stop. No one could explain why  it endured, only a handful tried to defend it. A few others, while not  defending examination without consent, wondered why rectal, vaginal and breast  examinations were such a special case. Contrary to this, patients were less  likely to share these views. One respondent suggested that consultants who  thought that intimate examinations were not especially intimate should hand  over their own body parts for examination by medical students. How can we  resolve the special ethical pitfalls surrounding intimate examinations? First,  medical students should be taught using mannequins and volunteers, rather than  patients. Second, students and patients might be more confident (and less  embarrassed) if students had a clearer and better respected place in the  medical team, including being covered by the team's consent procedures. Third,  we could teach intimate examinations only to postgraduates who need to know,  not to undergraduates or to postgraduates who will never need those skills,  says a consultant paediatrician. Finally, perhaps we should stop doing intimate  examinations altogether. 'We do these examinations because we have 'always done  them' and their importance is over-stated.'
