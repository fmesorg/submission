				<h4>Respect doctors' ethical  obligations</h4>
				<p>
					Hospital director Thys van Mollendorf was fired  because he condoned the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis to rape  survivors in the public Rob Fereira hospital in Mpumalanga province, South  Africa.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that the actions of the Mpumalanga MEC for Health, Ms  Sibongile Manana, who used a government tribunal to terminate the services of  Dr Thys von Mollendorff, are ethically indefensible. We call on her to  reconsider her actions in the light of doctors' universally recognised ethical  obligations to their patients, and to reinstate Dr von Mollendorff. Political  interference in healthcare delivery was unambiguously denounced by the World  Medical Association at the 38th World Medical Assembly in October 1986, as  follows:
				</p>
				<p>
					"Physicians must have the professional freedom to care for their  patients without interference. The exercise of the physician's professional  judgement and discretion in making clinical and ethical decisions in the care  and treatment of patients must be preserved and protected.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Physicians  must have the professional independence to represent and defend the health  needs of patients against all who would deny or restrict needed care for those  who are sick or injured."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr von Mollendorff acted within the letter and  spirit of this declaration. To victimise him for having defended the highest  principles of his profession, and for standing up for his mostly vulnerable and  poor patients, is unjust in terms of all civilised and humane ethical  standards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moreover, we believe that the MEC's actions go against President  Thabo Mbeki's call for volunteerism, since the services rendered by GRIP were funded  by voluntary contributions from the greater Nelspruit community, and were part  of the victim empowerment programme, officially mandated in terms of health  policy.
