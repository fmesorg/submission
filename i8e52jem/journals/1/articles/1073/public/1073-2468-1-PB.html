				<h4>Do  drug ads influence doctors?</h4>

				<p>
					The former editor of the  BMJ argues that to have financial independence a journal must have multiple  sources of income, such as subscriptions and reprints of articles, of which  drug advertising is the most profitable. Many companies advertise; therefore  none has the dominant power to influence policy. Also we are so bombarded by  advertisements that we tend to ignore them. Doctors are more influenced by  visits from drug representatives than by advertisements in medical journals.  Reprints of articles that drug companies buy in bulk produce more revenue for  the journal, and the temptation to print such industry- sponsored articles,  with an eye on reprint sales, is more damaging than the influence of  advertisers. Banning advertisements will also mean greater dependence on owners  of journals who can, and have, interfered with editorial independence. The  opposing viewpoint is that drug advertisements are biased and hype the scant  benefit of the drug while playing down its side effects. If editors refuse to  publish an inaccurate article in their journal, why should they publish  inaccurate data as an advertisement? If an advertisement is accepted it should  be vetted for the accuracy of its claims.

				<h4>Advance  directives are not enough</h4>
				<p>
					Advance directives  contain instructions about what care one wants or, more important, does not  want at the end of one's life. The author argues that such a directive cannot  have an answer for every crisis that may occur towards the end of life. It is  better to have several conversations with one's loved ones to make one's wishes  clear. Finally, one must trust the doctor to guide the family compassionately  towards the correct decisions.

				<h4>Treat  patients with dignity and compassion</h4>
				<p>
					The author describes the  four essential components to treating patients with dignity that preserves  their sense of identity and self worth. These are: the right attitude,  behaviour that reflects this attitude, compassion that should be the dominant  emotion and dialogue with the patient that expresses all of the above.

				<h4>Research  on prisoners</h4>
				<p>
					Research involving  prisoners was banned in the US in 1978 following public outcry against  experiments conducted in the prison population. Today it is accepted that true  informed consent can never be obtained in a prison setting, particularly when  financial or other incentives are offered. But, in 2004, an Institute of  Medicine report recommended that research be allowed in the prison population  but with strict safeguards of the subjects. Prison conditions would receive  more scrutiny and prisoners would have access to trials which could benefit  their medical conditions. The author accepts the arguments in the IOM report in  favor of such research but advises caution.

				<h4>How  doctors grieve</h4>
				<p>
					The author reflects on  why he feels a decreasing degree of sadness with each death in his patient  population. The need to protect oneself from another's suffering lest it impair  one's judgment, the feeling of hopelessness in the face of overwhelming medical  problems, and the possibility of medical errors, are some possible reasons  which may alter a doctor's behaviour. The author states that unless doctors  acknowledge and deal with these emotions, the doctor-patient relationship can  get dehumanised.

				<h4>Drug  company funding and patient groups</h4>
				<p>
					The first author argues  that provided the group and the donor have the same point of view there is no  harm in accepting money. The funding should be open, with no strings attached  and from multiple sources, so no one company can dominate. Since all donors,  whether industry or government, expect some degree of control, it is best to go  to the public at large for donations but this is harder when the subject, like  stem cell research, is difficult to explain to the general public. Patient  groups need to be pragmatic and accept funds to reach a wider audience, as long  as they are prepared to walk away from dubious donors. The second author feels  that accepting funds would damage the impartiality of the group and may skew  the policy so that it is favourable to the sponsoring company. A disclosure of  such funding is not enough to prevent biased advocacy.

				<h4>What  insurance companies should know about you</h4>
				<p>
					The first author argues  that since insurance companies seek and obtain other kinds of health  information, like smoking and drinking habits, to determine risk, and genetic  information should be treated in the same way. If society feels that all  healthy people in a society should share the burden of the unhealthy, then no  information needs to be given to the insurer. However if that scenario does not  exist then the insurer should have access to genetic information along with  other health information; if the person is denied or charged an exorbitant  premium this should be challenged in court, to force the insurers to make their  reasoning public. This will allow misconceptions about genetic information to  get cleared. The second author worries that disclosing genetic information  would lead to discrimination by insurers against those who are perceived to be  at a higher risk. Genetic information could be misinterpreted by the insurer as  indicating a definite risk of disease rather than just the probability of disease.  Disclosure may also result in very high, unaffordable insurance premiums.

				<h4>Research  ethics guidelines for developing countries</h4>
				<p>
					The European Commission  plans to use its research budget to build capacity and develop country-specific  ethical guidelines for research. Of the 100, 000 clinical trials taking place  around the world, 10 per cent are in developing countries. This number is expected  to grow in the coming years.

				<h4>Deception</h4>
				<p>
					The author argues that  while truthfulness is mandatory in a doctor-patient interaction, deception is  morally acceptable in certain situations. He proposes a stepwise chart to be  used by a doctor to determine whether or not the deception being is ethical. The  chart is also useful for teaching ethical reasoning to medical students and  residents.

				<h4>Opt-out  for organ donation?</h4>
				<p>
					The first author feels  that it is time to give up the failed opt-in system as countries with opt-out  system have far higher rates of organ donation. Presumed consent does not mean  that organs are removed without consulting the relatives. They are consulted at  every step and organs are taken only with their consent. The second author  feels that many variables affect the rate of organ donation in a country, not  just the procurement of organ without explicit permission. These include the  availability of trained staff and intensive care beds, and the extent of  information disseminated to the population. Without such an infrastructure, the  opt-out system will not result in higher rates of organ donation. Surveys show  that 90 per cent of the general public support organ donation; organs for  transplant fall short of the demand because relatives are unaware of the wishes  of the deceased.

				<h4>Disclosing  a mistake</h4>
				<p>
					Though doctors used to  be reluctant to disclose medical errors, they are becoming more receptive to  the idea. They need training on how to communicate these unpleasant details to  patients. The legal climate too must change to assure that transparency does not  result in lawsuits. The authors predict more transparency in the future in this  area of medicine.

				<h4>The  need to compensate vaccine-related injury</h4>
				<p>
					Vaccination protects not  just the person getting it but society at large. Vaccination-related injury  should be compensate as the person is contributing to the public good. The USA  introduced a no-fault compensation law to ensure that people would not sue vaccine  manufacturers and cripple the production of vaccine and there would be no  public outcry against getting vaccinated. The author urges the enactment of a  similar law in Canada.

				<h4>Whose  genes are these?</h4>
				<p>
					In this debate on who  owns an individual's genetic information - the individual or the entire family  -- the first author argues that the right to privacy of information must be  balanced against the harm that would result to another family or individual if the  information is not shared, as in a hereditary genetic disorder. The second  author feels that genetic information is private and should remain so. He says  that this information is different from that in an infectious epidemic where  information about a person's illness is vital to protect others from harm.

				<h4>Surgeons  must look for signs of child abuse</h4>
				<p>
					This editorial discusses  the need for paediatricians and paediatric surgeons to be on the watch for  signs of child abuse in their patients, and respond appropriately. There are  few data from India on child abuse and the reported incidence may only be the tip  of the iceberg.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors should be aware  of bruising, bite marks, burns, bone fractures or trauma to the head or  abdomen. Certain fractures are uncommon in the paediatric population; traumatic  sternal segment dislocation is considered to be the result of child abuse until  proven otherwise. It is the moral duty of the attending doctor to document and  report the matter to the appropriate agencies to protect the child. There may  be lethal consequences if child abuse is not prevented or managed in time.

				<h4>Indian  law discourages care to people attempting suicide</h4>
				<p>
					This article on suicide  prevention in India notes that according to Section 309 of the Indian Penal  Code, "whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the  commission of such an offense shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a  term which may extend to one year or with a fine or with both".
				</p>
				<p>
					As a result, emergency  care to those who have attempted suicide is denied as many hospitals and  practitioners hesitate to provide the needed treatment fearful of legal  hassles. Data on attempted suicides become difficult to ascertain as many  attempts are described to be accidental to avoid entanglement with police and  courts.

				<h4>Ethical  concerns in HIV/AIDS research in India</h4>
				<p>
					The authors discuss  major ethical concerns in HIV/AIDS research in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					A study amongst pregnant  women in Maharashtra found that, after group education and counseling, only 38%  women had understood six of eight key issues of informed consent about  HIV/AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Research organizations  must publish their findings. NACO should publish the results of its use of  nevirapine prophylaxis so that the benefits and limitations of the  interventions can be gauged by the scientific community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Administration of a  single-dose of nevirapine could result in the development of resistant HIV  strains and limit future treatment options for the mothers. New regimens are  also safe in pregnant women. However, WHO continues to include single dose  nevirapine as one of the alternative regimens.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corporate or political  groups may attempt to influence and control the study design. Researchers might  subordinate subjects' welfare to the objectives of the study.
				</p>
				<p>
					In short, the  populations most vulnerable to HIV infection and AIDS are the poor, uneducated  and powerless - who are also most vulnerable to exploitation in research.

				<h4>Health  professionals' responsibility to document human rights violations</h4>
				<p>
					With examples from the  US government's response in the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the  genocide in Rwanda, and the role of health professionals witnessing human  rights abuses in Nepal, the authors discuss the movement away from neutrality  towards an activist approach. They also discuss the responsibility of medical  practitioners to document and bear witness to violations of human rights, and  to intervene to alleviate suffering if possible. This paper is one of a series  on health and human rights.

				<h4>Stigma  and discrimination against HIV</h4>
				<p>
					This cross-sectional  survey looked at stigma and discrimination by health care providers with  relation to people with HIV in India. Of the 2,200 providers interviewed, less  than 25 per cent knew that HIV screening was not recommended before surgery.  Almost 20 per cent had refused treatment to people living with HIV or AIDS at  least some of the time. Nearly half of them identified and labelled them;  Almost 24 per cent of them isolated them, almost 14 per cent postponed or  changed treatment on the basis of the patient's HIV status. Sixty-seven per  cent screened for HIV before elective surgery. While almost 65 per cent were  aware of the existence of national guidelines, less than 38 per cent had read  them.

				<h4>Doctors  know little about palliative care</h4>
				<p>
					This pilot  cross-sectional qualitative study collected information from 50 providers of  palliative care, 20 cancer patients and 30 of their relatives. Few physicians  could enumerate more than three important technical elements of end-of-life  care. None of the physicians had received training in palliative care services.  Patients and their relatives felt the explanations and counselling were  inadequate. All but one of the cancer patients wanted to use special services  but were unaware of them.

				<h4>Arguments for and against folate fortification</h4>
				<p>
					The article supporting fortification argue that it has  demonstrably led to a marked reduction in the number of babies born with neural  tube defects. As many pregnancies are unplanned adding folate to the diet after  pregnancy is confirmed will not reduce risk. Data do not support the claim that  this supplementation leads to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. There is  also some evidence that folic acid reduces the risk of cleft palate and  prevents cognitive decline in old age.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those opposing fortification state that the primary justification  for this practice is a reduction of neural tube defects among newborns, though  it might also reduce the risk of certain cancers and protect against  cardiovascular disease. But folate metabolism is complex and synthetic folate  has different effects than do naturally occurring folate in foods. Recent  studies have also questioned the protection against cancer and cardiovascular  disease; on the contrary its use may lead to an increase in colorectal cancer.  They advise against fortification until more data become available.
