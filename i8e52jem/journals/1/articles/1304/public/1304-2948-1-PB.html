					When we scan the history  of human civilisations it becomes evident that the evolution of ethical  concepts has preoccupied philosophers, ethicists, sociologists, theologians,  professionals and indeed all of society. We then have to assume that evolving  ethical concepts is deemed as a necessity for guiding individuals and societies  with a view to furthering their wellbeing.
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin with we must be  clear as to what we mean by 'ethics', a word often used synonymously with  'morals'. Morals or moral philosophy pertain to the prevailing attitudes,  beliefs and rules of behaviour in a given society, are influenced by the  thought processes propagated in the environs of the time, and are therefore  subject to change. Ethical philosophy is concerned with the analysis of these  moral values to offer some guidelines on whether the moral philosophy is  appropriate or otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethical value systems  and moral principles must be pervasive in all sections of society and  particularly in those expected to provide leadership, such as in politics, the  administrative services and the professions. A down-gradation in one section  can have unwholesome effects on other sections. Witness today the consequences  of the low standards of ethics and morals in politics in our country. Medical  professionals are a part of society; they cannot stand on a separate pedestal,  and must be on their guard against such down-gradations affecting them.
				</p>
				<p>
					To summarise, ethical  philosophy is necessary to evolve principles which aim at preserving those  parts of the heritage of human societal structures which have served us in good  stead and which further the well-being, integrity and dignity of human beings.
				</p>

				<h4>Evolution in medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					We have come a  long way from the ethical principles enunciated by Hippocrates. Since then have  evolved the Hammurabi Code, the Islamic Code, those laid down by Sushruta and  Charaka, and down to the Geneva Declaration of the International Code of  Medical Ethics formulated in 1947 and amended in 1968, 1983 and again in 2000.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical ethics is  closely interwoven with societal morality in each era of civilisation and is  influenced by philosophical, theological, and scientific advances. Today we are  experiencing an unprecedented explosion in science and technology which in turn  influences concepts in medical practice. Whilst they have undoubtedly benefited  mankind in many areas, they has often been mis-utilised. Medical professionals  have become over-dependent on technology, dehumanising medical practice. These  advances then pose dilemmas of an ethical, moral, sociological and theological  nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					By its very definition  the word 'dilemma' implies that there can be more than one answer to a specific  question. We have then to discern between a technology's beneficial effects and  those ineffective, even harmful to the individual patient. It may be argued  that concepts of ethical philosophy are too abstruse and generalised and may  not be applicable to specific instances in which moral philosophy is causing a  dilemma. This is a misconception. The tenets of ethical philosophy can be  juxtaposed to such specific instances where moral philosophy needs to be  critically analysed. This brings into relief what Peck has described as 'code  ethics' versus 'situational ethics'. Application of the tenets of ethical  philosophy can then offer an ethically acceptable and practicable solution for  society.
				</p>
				<p>
					It becomes necessary  then to keep up a constant review of our ethical value systems without  compromising its basic tenets but taking into considerations economic and  societal realities. There are four basic pillars on which our concepts of  medical ethics rest today. They are:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Beneficence:</strong> this entails that whatever treatment we utilise does not harm the patient. It  also demands that any intervention must be done with the purpose of preventing,  removing or mitigating any harm that may have been caused.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Non-maleficence:</strong> this means that in the first place we should not act in any way  which may cause harm to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Autonomy</strong> of the individual is  today universally a well-accepted doctrine. This autonomy must be respected.  The days of 'medical paternalism' are gone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Society has a vested  interest in the profession and expects that our actions will be based on social  justice and responsibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on these foregoing  introductory remarks, I will venture now to offer some observations on ethics  of organ transplant.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Evolution of ethics in human organ transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					In 1831 when Jeremy  Bentham wrote an essay entitled 'Of what use is a dead man to the living?' he  could not have foreseen the advent of modern technology which now makes it  possible to transplant human tissues and organs. I mention this to re-emphasise  that scientific and technological advances call for a constant re-orientation  of prevailing concepts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secular and theological  thinking has for centuries considered the 'principle of totality' inviolable in  order to maintain the total integrity of the human being. Hence any destruction  of the human body or its parts is contrary to this principle. However, in the  past four or five decades, this principle has been analysed in view of the need  for tissues and organs for transplantation, to benefit other human beings. Thus  ethical principles have evolved to suggest that transplantation would be within  the bounds of ethics if certain criteria are fulfilled, in instances of living  donor transplantation. These are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The removal of the tissue or       organ does not impair the health or functional integrity of the donor.
					</li>
					<li>
						The benefits expected to be       given to the recipient bear an acceptable proportion to the harm likely to       the donor.
					</li>
					<li>
						The donation should be       altruistic and is given without any coercion or any other form of external       pressure.
					</li>
					<li>
						The donor must be fully       informed of the nature of the procedure and the possible &mdash; even if rare &mdash;       complications. This entails the need for follow-up of the donor's       health in the future.
					</li>
					<li>
						The views of close relatives       such as the spouse or adult children are taken into account.
					</li>
					<li>
						There must be no element of       commercialisation or exploitation in the donation.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					It is not always easy to  establish with any degree of certainty that all these criteria were met in an  individual case. However these criteria offer a basis on which we can comprise  our ethical principles.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics in genetically-related living donor transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					It will suffice here to  say in this context that if the criteria for donation enumerated earlier are  satisfied, there is ethical justification in accepting the donation. I will  still stress that the donor must be made fully aware of the nature of the  procedure. His or her psychological make-up should be taken into consideration,  as should be the views of the donor family. We must, to the best of our  ability, establish that there has been no undue coercion. All these require  communication skills (which, along with concepts of ethics and the history of  medicine, are never imparted to us as undergraduates).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics in non-related living donor transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					This form of  transplantation raises some specific issues of ethics for medical professionals  and grave issues of social morality, since it is inevitably connected with the  commodification of human organs. The shortage of donor tissues and organs has  encouraged 'market forces' and the commerce in human organs. I restrict  my remarks to our country and the experiences in live non-related donor  transplantation of kidneys.
				</p>
				<p>
					The question we need to  pose is: can the criteria as laid out for live donor transplantation be  fulfilled in non-related donor transplantation?
				</p>
				<p>
					Take the basic criterion  of altruism and its negation by commercialisation. Whilst altruism may be a  genuine motive in the rare case, we all know that in the vast majority of cases  the motivation is the financial reward. As for voluntariness, what greater  coercion can there be than dangling the promise of Rs 30,000-40,000 before a  poor donor?
				</p>
				<p>
					As for informed consent,  I wonder if illiterate and economically depressed donors are given full details  in a language understood by them, and whether their families are taken into  confidence. Informed consent consists of more than a signature on the  dotted line. Do medical professionals confirm voluntary informed consent  through a personal discussion, and is it duly and faithfully recorded in the  case papers?
				</p>
				<p>
					The other important  criterion is that there shall not be any commecialisation or exploitation.  Commercialisation is self-evident. Exploitation should be a matter of concern  to society. The most lurid is that by the middleman or broker who thrives on  the gullibility of the illiterate or on the economic strain of the weaker  sectors of society. How much of the sum actually goes into the donor's pocket  is a matter of guess work. Then there is the exploitation of the donor's  poverty by the rich recipient. It is argued that the poor man needs the money  which the rich man has with him to give and thereby a little redistribution of  wealth is made. I venture to suggest that it is a redistribution of  health from the poor &mdash; who can ill afford it &mdash; to the rich. The inequity of the  situation is surely against the grain of social ethics.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is argued that  individuals are free to donate their kidney for a price, as much as they are  free to sell their labour or other services. It is also argued that  individuals have freedom of action. There are grave dangers to moral values of  society in such propositions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The freedom of  individuals to behave as they wish is always circumscribed by the needs of the  greater good of social morality. The proposition pits a distorted value system  of individuals in need and their methods of obtaining that need against  established value systems of organised society. If society accepts the trade in  human organs, it will be replacing the concept of the human organism's  intrinsic value with the extrinsic value of the human body or its parts, making  them a commodity. This destroys individuals' autonomy and dignity. There are  also dangers of extortion and even criminalisation, as the recipient's identity  may be known to the donor and his family.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this situation, the  dilemma before the medical fraternity is acute when faced with a patient who  has no family donors or chances of obtaining a cadaver donation within a  reasonable time, and cannot afford chronic dialysis. Do we let such patients  die? Do we refuse them a non-related donor transplantation? Out of  sympathy for such patients, I would like to evolve a strategy which separates  transplantation from the nexus of commercialisation. But I find myself groping  in the dark. I am aware that the latest Human Organ Transplantation Act  provides for some safeguards, but there are many loopholes. Non-related donor  transplantation can be carried out provided all aspects of the procedure are  approved by what an 'approval committee'. But who does this committee consist  of besides medical bureaucrats? Does it receive advice from lawyers, ethicists,  sociologists, psychologists, etc. to help it make its judgements? I am  skeptical of that.
				</p>
				<p>
					A rather novel concept  has been floated, of 'rewarded gifting'. I consider this merely a  terminological subterfuge. It represents the commodification of human organs  while placating professionals. I did not realise that one gives a gift and  expects a reward! I find the arguments of protagonists of this concept  specious and am unable to find an ethical compromise which safeguards social  morality.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>Obligation to the recipient and family</h4>
				<p>
					Recipients must be fully  informed about the nature of their illness. They must be given a choice in the  modalities of treatment, namely haemodialysis and transplantation. They must be  given a clear picture of the nature of the operation and its likely sequelae,  both immediate and long term. Recipients and their families have to be informed  of the economics of the treatment, particularly the need for post-transplant  medications which can be expensive. It is distressing to see families face  economic ruin on account of a transplant, with the liquidation of all their  assets and the compromise of other family members' future. In this  context, professionals must exercise extreme judgement in advising  transplantation for patients with contraindications to the procedure. They must  estimate the chances of success. They must take the moral responsibility of  advising the family clearly on the issue.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethics in relation to cadaver organ transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					It might seem that that  there are no serious ethical problems in this form of organ transplantation but  there are some issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many  theological and religious concepts expressing the inviolability of the human  body even after death, in the belief that the body should reach the other world  as a whole. However, it has been argued that if we believe in the concept of  reincarnation, we are concerned only with the 'spiritual passing away' of life,  leaving our physical bodies as empty shells. It would then be within the bounds  of ethical principles, both theological and sectarian, to allow such bodies or  their parts to be used for the benefit of humanity. Today many theologians of  various religions share this view. Still, there will be groups and  families who adhere to the stricter religious concepts. Professionals are  ethically bound to respect their sentiments when approaching the subject of  organ donations.
				</p>
				<p>
					This brings us to some  of the ethical dilemmas in cadaver donation programmes, namely of  establishing priorities in the choice of patients to receive a cadaver  kidney, as the demand will far outstrip the supply. This will be all the more  applicable when one donor matches more than one potential recipient. The  question is: what parameters should we employ when excluding so many in need?  Is it age? Should a judgement of whether the patient's economic resources will  allow for for long-term success be made? Is it dictated by the need of the  family to have an earning member restored to health? Is it by the importance of  the individual to society? Should it be purely on medical grounds? Or  shall we make the final choice by drawing lots? Such dilemmas cannot be easily  resolved but need to be addressed.
				</p>

				<h4>Ethics in relation to society</h4>
				<p>
					Throughout history we  observe that the practice of medicine has been closely intertwined with the  social, economic and moral texture of society. All advances in medical science  have always promised an impact on society. But the medical technological advances  of the past two or three decades have been so phenomenal that society is often  left bewildered. There is always a time lag between the advent of such advances  and the time required for society to absorb their impact. This places a  moral and ethical duty on professionals to be explicit in our approach and  explanations. We have to help society make what Illich calls 'social  assessment of technological progress'. We are an integral part of society and  we cannot isolate ourselves on a pedestal by assuming a posture that we are  only concerned with our technical perfections and service without reference to  social needs and morality. Morality in medical practice has no different  dimensions than morality in other sectors of society. The finger that points to  lack of morality and ethics in other sectors may also be pointing at us.
				</p>
				<p>
					The concept of brain  death &mdash; or more precisely brain stem death &mdash; has created problems for  society to understand. This places two types of ethical and moral burdens on  professionals. They must convince society of the ethics of brain stem death,  and if the concept is accepted ensure that the criteria of brain stem death are  clearly articulated and scrupulously enforced.
				</p>
				<p>
					If society expects (and  rightly so) medical professionals to maintain high levels of ethical and moral  standards in the execution of organ transplantation programmes, professionals  will expect that society will also undertake to bear its responsibilities &mdash; to  mobilise its economic, man-power and other resources for the purpose. It must  promote awareness of the issue and the need. It must reorient social ethics on  these issues. Society will have to foster and sustain such activities and  thereby also act as a watchdog. If society shirks its responsibilities today,  it may not have a second chance tomorrow.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would like at the end  of this article to say that the views expressed in this article arise from my  personal perceptions of the issues. Let them be debated by society as a whole  and medical professionals in particular.
