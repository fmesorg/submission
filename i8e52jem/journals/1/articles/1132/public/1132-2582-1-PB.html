				<h4>Eliza Lo Chin (ed). This side of doctoring: reflections from
				women in medicine. New Delhi: Sage Publications, 2002.
				$ 29.99, pp 394.</h4>
				<p>
					This book is an anthology of stories, poems, essays and
					quotations interwoven like a quilt to capture the essence
					of being 'a woman and a doctor' in America. It tries to
					reflect the sentiments of more than 140 contributors, who
					besides being women doctors are also daughters, wives,
					mothers, teachers, students and community leaders&mdash;each role demanding a fair degree of skill and expertise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical literature and stories about doctors have
					remained predominantly male-centric. Written
					sensitively and from the heart, there are a variety of
					contributions in this book that reflect the trials,
					tribulations, delight and distress that women physicians
					in America faced and continue to face.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eliza Lo Chin (the editor) begins with a historical
					perspective on how women who have been caregivers
					and healers for a long time began their formal foray into
					medical institutions in the nineteenth century, in the face
					of hostility, rejection and societal disapproval. She charts
					the progress to today, when more and more women are
					entering the realms of medicine&mdash;<em>a recent American</em> Medical Association (AMA) report states that for the first
					time women applicants (50.8%) outnumbered men in
					applying to US medical schools in the 2003-2004
				academic year, signifying a milestone. </p>
				<p>
					Eliza strikes a cautious note though, when she highlights a
					recent study among female physicians, which quotes a
					surprising 31% respondents as saying they might not
					choose the same career path again. Predictors influencing
					this decision included high work stress, history of
					harassment, increased family responsibilities and lack of
					job autonomy. In today's rapidly changing world, this book
					attempts to portray how women balance a tiring and
					demanding profession with the pressures of family life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the section on early pioneers, letters, writings and
					memoirs have been dug up to sketch an understanding of
					how the first women doctors were trained and practised their graduation from 'chivalry and off Colour jokes to
					acceptance and respect'. The lack of facilities for women
					doctors on duty in hospitals and they being forced to use
					the nurses' rooms by male superiors was one of the many
					impediments on a daily basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the section on Formative Years, the allure and
					challenges of the medical education system are discussed.
					This section 'Life in the Trenches' deals with the period
					of internship and residency with 36-hour duties and how
					many contributors juggled additional responsibilities of
					a fresh marriage, motherhood or both. 'Doctoring'
					highlights the varied hues of a doctor-patient relationship
					while 'Mothering and Doctoring' deals with the pain and
					guilt which many women physicians feel when they
					cannot devote adequate time to their young children, tired
					and flustered with work pressures as they are. This leads
					to often 'Making Choices', where some physicians describe
					lost opportunities and painful personal decisions such as
					not having children, to devote themselves to their
					profession.
			  </p>
				<p>
					'Barriers' presents the hurdles that women have to face,
					when they try to enter the traditional male specialties
					such as orthopaedic surgery. Challenges of being in
					administrative positions&mdash;the 'Boys Clubs', and of being
					from racial and ethnic minorities for women are
					portrayed. Sexual harassment and the issues of freedom
					of sexual orientation are laid threadbare through sharing
					of vignettes from their lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next two chapters deal with how relationships are
					influenced by the 'doctor' role of these women and how
					they have to maintain a balance in many situations. In the
					last couple of chapters families share their views on how
					they look up to these women and reflections by
					contributors about their medical careers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, this experiential sharing is honest and direct,
					revealing the various facets of the personalities and lives
					of these extraordinary medical professionals. It would be
					worthwhile if a similar exercise was attempted in India to
					portray the lives of women in medicine; the addition of a
					historical perspective would help in the understanding.
