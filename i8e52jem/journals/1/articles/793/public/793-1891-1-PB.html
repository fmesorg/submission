					When  the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was first discovered over 20 years ago,  there began a huge effort to educate people about the risks associated with HIV  infection, and promote abstinence, condoms and clean needles as ways to curb  the growing rate of infection. Despite the massive effort and expenditure put  into prevention of HIV infection, the global infection rate has increased, not  decreased. Researchers and the medical community have had to take a closer look  at the problem to realise that prevention of HIV infection is more complex than  just giving people education about the disease or providing resources in the  form of condoms or clear needles. Cultural, racial, economic and gender  barriers put people at risk for HIV infection. As such, HIV programmes turned  their focus to 'empowering' dis-advantaged groups (e.g. women, drug users, the  destitute poor)-people who may be taking risks because of oppressive conditions  regardless of what they know about how the virus is transmitted. Empowerment  programmes, for example, have attempted to address issues related to HIV  infection by investigating cultural taboos regarding sex or those related to  the standard of living of marginalised populations. Even with programmes that  acknowledge and address the complex and social nature of HIV transmission, the  epidemic continues to rise. This article explores ideas about the broad social,  political and economic factors that affect HIV prevention and highlights some  ideas about alternative ways to understand the root cause of the spread of HIV  infection.

				<h4>Linking  illness with social conditions of oppression</h4>
				<p>
					Education  regarding prevention of HIV infection has developed from what modern medicine  has told us about the characteristics of the virus. Yet there is an important  contradiction in modern medicine. Its underlying philosophies and research are  supported by the advancement of industrial society despite the fact that  industrialisation is an exploitative practice that creates conditions of  poverty and marginalisation. It is an approach that strives to prevent, treat  and cure illness without accounting for the broader social, political and  economic forces that create vulnerability to disease. This was clearly shown by  Engels in his study, <em>The Conditions of the Working Class in England</em>. There existed an  exceptionally high incidence of disease, including typhus and tubercu-losis, in  the working class population of Manchester. Engels uncovered that the poor  health of this population was directly linked to their position in the emerging  industrial society. While medical research attempted to find cures by focusing  on the biology of disease, Engels noted that overcrowding, poor ventilation,  stagnant sewers and polluted water were the root causes of the problem and the  real cure was to improve the standard of living among this population <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Singer M. The political economy of AIDS. Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing, 1998." id="1">(1)</a>.  Similarly, in the case of HIV infection, a medical perspective assumes that the  virus is the agent of disease, lack of hygiene is the basis of the problem and  behaviour modification is the way to reduce the rates of infection. However,  addressing the issue at the level of biology does not challenge the imbalance  of power embedded in political and economic systems that put people at risk in  the first place. People who participate in high-risk activity often do so under  adverse conditions. As such, HIV infection-prevention practitioners need to incorporate  a perspective that broadens the focus from individual risk-taking behaviour to  studying the social forces that put people at risk. This would assume perhaps  that while the virus is the agent of the disease, poverty and exploitation is  the basis of the problem and resistance to this exploitation is the way to  reduce infection.

				<h4>HIV,  industrialisation and development</h4>
				<p>
					One  approach to understanding the challenges of prevention is to understand its  relationship with the forces of industrialisation and development. Until the  mid 1990s, HIV infection was treated as a health issue addressed by AIDS  organisations and public health departments at the local, national and  international levels. However, by the mid 1990s, concern was raised that AIDS  was not being adequately addressed through health programming and was put on  the international development agenda. As such, the World Health Organization's  Global Programme on AIDS was shut down and replaced by UNAIDS. The logic behind  the marriage of AIDS and 'development' was made clear: because the epidemic is  affecting large populations of young employable men and women in parts of the  developing world, the future survival of nations and their economies are at  stake.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  commonly believed that industrialisation and development help to stimulate  economic growth, create jobs, raise the standard of living, and improve the  quality of life of people living in so-called 'developing' countries. Thus,  proponents of development, such as the World Bank, suggest that economic  stimulation is the way to eradicate the HIV epidemic. I suggest that the  opposite is true-that international forces pushing for development and  industrialisation of the non-industrial world have exacerbated the spread of  HIV and promoted the devel-opment of an HIV-prevention industry. Lurie et al. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Lurie P, Hintzen P, Lowe R. The impact of International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies on HIV transmission in developing countries. International Conference on AIDS. 1994;10:443." id="2">(2)</a> examined the impact of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank  structural adjustment policy on risk factors for HIV transmission in developing  countries. They found that structural adjustment programmes required developing  countries to reduce government spending on health and social services, increase  personal income tax, devalue currency, provide concessions to foreign investors  and increase the price of goods and services. Following these shifts they noted  declining sustainability of rural subsistence economies as economic activity  shifted to the export sector, increasing levels of poverty and landlessness,  development of a transportation infrastructure to serve export economies and  increasing urbanisation. These factors have contributed to the disruption of  family life as rural dwellers have left rural areas for the city in search of  employment. The risk of contracting HIV infection has increased substantially  along transportation routes and drug trade has emerged in many urban centres.

					A good  example of how industrialisation affects the spread of HIV infection is the  World Bank's Chad-Cameroon Oil Pipeline Project. Beginning in 1998, this  30-year, US$ 3.5 billion project involves developing oilfields in southern Chad  and the construction of a 1,100 km pipeline to port facilities on the Atlantic  coast of Cameroon. During peak construction, the project will draw over 2,500  construction workers and truckers to areas where poverty, prostitution and HIV  infection are high <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Bank Report. Confronting AIDS: Public priorities in a global epidemic. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999." id="3">(3)</a>. While the Bank claims that the project will provide  substantial economic benefits to both the countries, critics are concerned that  the migratory labour force will exacerbate the spread of HIV/AIDS in the  project area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the  complexity of the HIV epidemic, powerful institutions that promote  industrialisation are taking a more aggressive approach to solving the problem.  For example, the president of the World Bank, James Wolfsensohn, recently made  an historic appearance before the United Nations Security Council calling for a  'war on AIDS'. He urged the Council to allocate more money to AIDS efforts  because the epidemic is turning back the clock on development by increasing  cross-border conflict, destabilising economies and undermining large portions  of the labour force. Funds taken from the Council would be used to develop an  'AIDS technology and surveillance infrastructure.' The World Bank's approach to  prevention relies heavily on technological advance. Yet Clark and Boyles <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Clark C, Boyles S. India: HIV spreads despite World Bank project. Blood Weekly 1999;11-13." id="4">(4)</a> note that World Bank HIV prevention programmes are failing to curb the high  rate of infection in India and that funds 'are spent on activities like  information and communication and importing expensive blood banking equipment,  most of which is lying unused for lack of basic infrastructure like a steady  power supply'. This approach taken to solve the problem of the epidemic is far  from realistic. However, it allows the technical industries to profit by  developing technologies that promise to solve the problem. Waring <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Waring M. Who's counting [videorecording]: Marilyn Waring on sex, lies, and global economics. National Film Board of Canada [Studio B], 1995." id="5">(5)</a> points  out that the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which 11 million gallons of heavy  crude oil spilled in waters near Alaska, stimulated the economy through the  creation of thousands of jobs to clean up the mess. Similarly, the clean-up of  the AIDS crisis will require more jobs and more loans. If the World Bank is  generating income from the interest of HIV infection-prevention loans, and if  profit is being made off technological advance in the name of HIV prevention,  then money is being made off the backs of those suffering the effects of the  epidemic. How can we be assured that global development efforts in prevention  will be effective if HIV is of value in the global economy?
				</p>
				<p>
					In  examining the medical basis of prevention of HIV infection as well as the  industrial response to the epidemic, it is clear that the layers of inequity  and of inequitable power relations create vulnerability and that  industrialisation impedes real measures to reduce the rates of HIV  transmission. HIV infection-prevention efforts must incorporate an awareness of  the effects of industrialisation and development and must be aligned with  anti-development movements that are restoring dignity, human rights and power  to marginalised people. It is through resistance to globalisation and  development that communities can reduce their vulnerability and develop  immunity to disease. From this perspective, we can begin to understand what is  really needed to end the AIDS epidemic.
