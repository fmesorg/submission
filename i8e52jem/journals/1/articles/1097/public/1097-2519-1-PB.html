					As the  audited accounts printed on this page show, subscription income did not cover  the cost of printing and posting the journal. In addition, there were the  salaries of two part-time employees and other subsidised, administrative costs.  (For the past 11 years, the editorial and administrative offices have been in  the homes or offices of members.)
				</p>
				<p>
					Income  from subscriptions has fallen to Rs 71,078 (from Rs 91,275 in 2001-2002)  following the completion of the collaboration with CEHAT to promote medical ethics  through gift subscriptions to various individuals and institutions in the hope  that they would renew. The income from sale of back issues, including CDs, has  fallen from Rs 53,235.75 (in 2001-2002) to Rs 7,168 with the end of the  collaboration with CEHAT.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the  same time, printing and posting of the journal were more expensive in the year  under review, at Rs 1,29,416.50 (including Rs 27,000 for making CDs) compared  to Rs 87,594.75 in the previous year.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  accounts show, as income, two items which we cannot treat as income for the  purposes of the organisation. One of these is Rs 40,940 representing life  subscriptions which are over six years old and no longer refundable. (According  to a resolution in 1996, life subscriptions are refundable if the journal  closes down within six years of the subscription). Another source of income  presented on this page is the money for a study on pharmaceutical promotional  practices, funded by the WHO, for which Rs 75,000 was received as the first  instalment and Rs 37,957 was spent in the financial year under review  (presented in Schedule B).
				</p>
				<p>
					If the  income from life subscriptions no longer refundable and the unspent money from  the WHO project is deducted (and the surplus carried forward to balance sheet  in included), the true shortfall of income over expenditure is Rs 64,287.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  number of expenses are envisaged in the coming year. The FMES and the Journal  need separate office spaces. Since 2001, the website <a href="http://www.issuesinmedicalethics.org/" target="_blank">www.issuesinmedicalethics.org</a> has been kindly  subsidised by M/s Sabu Francis and Associates, but some payment for the website  hosting will have to be made from this coming year. The estimated minimum  future expenses per annum, to run an office, print and post the journal, and  maintain the website, are approximately Rs 3 lakh.
				</p>
				<p>
					For  these reasons, the following decisions were taken at the annual general body  meeting on September 7, 2003.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Life  subscriptions would remain in fixed deposits and the interest used to service  the subscription. Money from life subscriptions which were removed from fixed  deposits would be replaced.
					</li>
					<li>
						Subscription rates (except for foreign subscriptions) would be  increased to ensure that the journal's production costs were covered by income  from subscriptions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Subscription and fund-raising drives would be undertaken.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					An  application was made by M/s Sachin P Mulgaokar and Co, Chartered  Accountants who audit our accounts, for 50% income tax deduction under Section  80G. Starting in November 2003, donations to FMES till March 2006 are  eligible for 50% income tax deduction under Section 80G.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  thank Dr Pramod Dukle, Dr Motwani, Ms Shubada Gadre and Dr SK Pandya for  donations totalling Rs 9,500 in this financial year.
