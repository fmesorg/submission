				<h4>The debate</h4>
				<p>
					Medical science and technology have made great strides in recent years. The  medical profession has today more power over life and death than it would have  chosen to have. It has the power to prolong life where life seems to have lost  its meaning and power to terminate life without suffering. There are many  points of view on euthanasia -- legal, social and compassionate.
				</p>
				<p>
					The debate on euthanasia has again become a  live issue in India as the supreme court of India recently passed a verdict  that attempted suicide is not a crime. This signifies social approval of  suicide and euthanasia which is assisted suicide.

				<h4>What is euthanasia?</h4>
				<p>
					Euthanasia is deliberately bringing about a gentle and easy death making the  last days of the patient as comfortable as possible. This is to ensure a calm  and peaceful death, within the context of relieving incurable suffering in  terminal illness or disability. Euthanasia is voluntary, when requested by the  sufferer, involuntary or compulsory if it is against the will of the patient,  passive when death is hastened by deliberate withdrawal of effective therapy or  nourishment.

				<h4>The dilemma</h4>
				<p>
					While I was working in England, I was resuscitating an elderly lady who was  admitted in the hospital emergency ward with severe demonstrable cerebral  damage. My chief of surgery, an Englishman and devout Christian, told me  gently, <em>"I don't want to  interfere with your procedures but if she were my mother I wouldn't do all that  you are doing and would allow her to die peacefully".</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is often our dilemma. Should one prolong  the act of dying in a case of inevitable death or when a life is effectively  over? One of the achievements of modern medical technology is the use of  artificial life support systems like artificial feeding, dialysis, controlled  respiration, pump circulation etc. In some cases it can be so dehumanising,  painful, hazardous or costly that other considerations outweigh the aim to  conserve life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Euthanasists raise the question, how long  should one sustain life? A patient might say, <em>"I do not want a vegetative  existence by drips, drugs and dialysis. I want to die with dignity. I have a  right to lay down my life just as I have a right to live".</em>
				</p>

					In a well known trial, a Dr. Arthur in U. K.  had prescribed an overdose of codeine to a baby with Down syndrome with the  object of hastening his death Dr. Arthur was charged with murder. Many eminent  witnesses were tried. Most of them justified the procedure. Finally the court  acquitted Dr. Arthur as his motive was compassion. There is an argument that if  a foetus is found to be abnormal and severely handicapped it should be  eliminated before birth as such children are socially valueless. Do not the  physically handicapped and mentally retarded have as much right to life as  others and get the needed care?

				<h4>Death and dying</h4>
				<p>
					The concept of death is changing in the light of new knowledge. It may be  obtained by redefining life. Descriptions of life are organised at many  different levels of complexity - molecular, cellular, organ, system, corporal,  mental, spiritual etc. Human life may be described as the ability, actual or  potential to respond to others, or to be self-aware. This is based on cerebral  function. Silverman and others in 1969 have established this by extensive  studies and confirmed it by encephalogram findings. Once cerebral death is  confirmed, there is no chance for survival though heart and lung functions  continue. So it would be quite unnecessary to continue supportive measures  after cerebral death.
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>The Christian concept</h4>
				<p>
					Almighty God has created man in his image. He is the giver and sustainer of  life. He alone has the right to withdraw life. Life is not a right but a gift  of God, belonging to God and at all times in His hand. We have no right to take  away deliberately a human life, even one's own.
				</p>
				<p>
					Euthanasia requests may be born of depression  and confusion or out or a feeling of worthlessness or due to persuasion of  interested parties with ulterior motives. Respect for the person of the patient  and concern for the family should lead us to use our resources as best as we  can to promote life. The essence of our approach to a dying patient is to give  ourselves in loving care to meet his need. A patient is not merely a biological  unit but a person before God with social family connections.

				<h4>Suffering</h4>
				<p>
					Suffering can be  redemptive and purposeful. It is as much a God - sent opportunity as is health  and provides an opportunity for a creative outcome or an amendment of life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let me share with you the experience of two of  my friends who faced the issue of caring for children with disability. One was  a hospital chaplain. When a child with disability was born to him, he asked God  why this happened to him, but he could not get an immediate answer. He loved  that child but the child could not respond to his love in the normal way. They  helped the pastor to realise how God loves us inspite of our not being  responsive to His love. The other was a colleague of mine and a highly  qualified paediatrician when a child with disability was born to him and his  doctor wife. They did their very best to sustain her life. The child became  critically ill immediately after birth,needing exchange blood transfusions.  Though their colleagues questioned the wisdom of taking such an extreme step  for such a child, they choose to have the exchange transfusions. The child  recovered and subsequently brought a new purpose to their life before she  finally died at 4 months of age. Through this the parents realised that God had  a purpose in bringing her to their home. This experience was an act of God to  make them aware of the need of caring for many neglected children with  disability in our society.So they resigned from their clinical work and offered  their lives to start a centre for children with mental handicaps and special  needs. An apparent traumatic experience became the rallying point for a new  mission and for compassion.

				<h4>Our guiding principle</h4>
				<p>
					Ever since the time of Hippocrates in the fifth century BC, the medical  profession has been guided by the concept of the worth of each individual human  life. This was recently reaffirmed by the Geneva code in 1948, which states, <em>"I will show the utmost respect for human life  from the time of conception."</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hitler had a utilitarian philosophy of life.  He preserved any person who had utilitarian value. The others he eliminated. We  respect the unique value of human life. Life should be cherished, supported and  cared.

				<h4>Some practical steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Doctors should serve and care for their patients in love.
					</li>
					<li>
						Deliberate attempt to end or shorten life,  whether by omission or commission, is wrong and should not be done.
					</li>
					<li>
						Our society should proclaim the way of  righteousness and truth and provide compassionate care. It must take a stand  against taking innocent lives.
					</li>
					<li>
						Medical personnel and the people at large  must be educated in moral and spiritual values. These should lead to sound  legislation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring in the principle of love as the  mainspring.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					Views, ideas, even  concepts of ethics are fast changing in the context or the progress of science  and technology. The traditional institutions in our society, which protect  human life and spiritual values, are gradually being pushed aside or getting  eliminated. Love is the foundation of ethics. Loving our God with all our  heart, soul and mind and loving our neighbour as ourselves, are the two  foundations for our ethical practice. Only a code of ethics based on sound  principles can lead our society to lasting happiness,harmony and peace.
