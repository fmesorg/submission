					As a result of sustained agitation by women's  groups in the 1980s, a law was enacted banning the use of prenatal diagnostic  technology for sex detection enabling sex selective abortion. However, the  practice continued despite this law. Recently, health and women's groups  went to court to enforce the law, and also called for amendments to cover sex  selection by other means. Now some doctors are seeking the court's permission  to permit pre-conceptual sex selection.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following survey findings should make the medical  profession rethink its attitude to sex selection, as well as its support of the  government's population control programme which is concentrating on numbers,  not on people's health.
				</p>

				<h4>Sex ratio</h4>
				<p>
					The preliminary results of the 2001 census <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Registrar General of India, Census of India 2001, Provisional Population Totals, Series 1, India, Paper 1 of 2001." id="1">(1)</a> reveal that the sex ratio for children under the age of six shows a dramatic  decline from 976 for every 1,000 males in 1961 to 927 in 2001. This decline was  most obvious in Himachal Pradesh (897), Gujarat (878), Delhi (865), Chandigarh  (845), Haryana (820) and Punjab (793). Many of these states are economically  developed with fairly high literacy levels. Even Kerala reported a ratio of  just 963 in this age group.

				<h4>Nutrition</h4>
				<p>
					Early nutritional status is a major determinant of  a person's future growth and development. Damage caused by poor nutrition  during foetal development and childhood cannot be completely undone with better  diets in later life. Women with poor nutrition give birth to underweight babies  with poor growth rates and lower chances of survival.
				</p>
				<p>
					Approximately 36 per cent of children born in India  are low birth weight (LBW), a result of prenatal malnutrition. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences. National Family Health Survey. 1998-99 (NFHS-2), 2000, Mumbai, India" id="2">(2)</a> There is  little variation in the percentage of LBW babies by order of birth, indicating  that controlling higher order births ('family planning') is no solution. What  is needed improvement in mothers' health.
				</p>
				<p>
					The National Family Health Surveys 1 and 2, in  1992-3 and 1998-9 respectively, collected data representing 99 per cent of the Indian  population. The NFHS-2 found that almost half of children under the age of  three years were underweight for their age (18 per cent severely), a measure of  both short- and long-term under-nutrition. At least one in five children were  underweight in every state. Forty-six per cent were stunted (23 per cent  severely) in their height for age. Seventy-four per cent of children between  the ages of six to 35 months, were anaemic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The prevalance of anaemia among children was  related to the anaemia status of their mothers. The NFHS-2 found that more than  one in three women aged 15-49 were undernourished (Body Mass Index below 18.5  kg/m2), indicating chronic energy deficiency. Overall 52 per cent of women were  anaemic. Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risks of maternal and infant  death, premature delivery, and low birth weight. In India pregnant women are  more likely to be anaemic. More than six out of 10 women were anaemic in Assam,  Bihar, Orissa and West Bengal.

				<h4>The population policy</h4>
				<p>
					The medical profession seems to share the  government's view that the population policy is a national priority. India is  the only country that promotes population control almost exclusively through a  female sterilisation programme. In the six and a half years between the two  NFHSs, the share of female sterilisation of total contraception has risen from  67 <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences. National Family Health Survey 1992-93 (NFHS), 1996, Mumbai, India." id="3">(3)</a> per cent to 71 per cent <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences. National Family Health Survey. 1998-99 (NFHS-2), 2000, Mumbai, India" id="2">(2)</a>, and that of male sterilisation has  decreased from nine per cent to four per cent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Seventy-one per cent of sterilisations are  conducted by government services. Only 13.1 per cent of women seeking  contraception in the private sector opt for female sterilisation and 8.9 per  cent choose male sterilisation, suggesting that sterilisation is not a method  of people's choice. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences. National Family Health Survey. 1998-99 (NFHS-2), 2000, Mumbai, India" id="2">(2)</a> The median age at female sterilisation is 25.7 years.  Eighty-two per cent of women undergoing sterilisation had never used any other  contraceptive method. One in four sterilised women reported chronic health  problems following sterilisation <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Institute for Population Sciences. National Family Health Survey. 1998-99 (NFHS-2), 2000, Mumbai, India" id="2">(2)</a>. It is in this context that the medical  profession should root its discussion of issues such as sex selection and the  government's population policy. In a patriarchal society, population control  policies in conjunction with sex selection techniques may reduce childbearing  but at the cost of women's health and the health of the next generation.
				</p>
				<p>
					What about the medical profession's responsibility  to improve people's health and welfare? What about its responsibility to enable  women to gain more control over their lives and their health? What about its  responsibility to enable women to give birth to, and raise, healthy children?
				</p>
				<p>
					Promoting female sterilisation without giving women  access to other contraceptives; sterilising young women when one in four of  them will develop life-long health problems, promoting sex selection technology  as a medical solution for son preference - in these ways, medical professionals  further oppress women, instead of empowering them, instead of responding to  their concerns. They will further distance themselves from people's needs,  driven by personal profit and a belief in the sanctity of their goals.
