				<h4>Sponsored conferences</h4>
				<p>
					In India drug companies are the major sponsors of local, state and national  medical conferences, paying speakers and their travel and accommodation costs,  as well as individual registration fees for certain doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					We approached a chemist's shop and obtained the prescriptions written over one  month by four physicians in this area. Three of the four, who are known to be  sponsored by a particular drug company on various tours, turned out to be major  prescribers of this company's products. The fourth physician, who prescribed  cheaper products, is not invited to such functions at all. Further, this doctor  has been ostracised by his own colleagues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Few doctors raise their voices against sponsorship by drug companies.  Sponsorship is flourishing like a disease, particularly in cities. The industry  must have its wings clipped.
