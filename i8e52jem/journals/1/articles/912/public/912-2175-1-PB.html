				<h4>Corruption in health systems: view from Peru</h4>
				<p>
					Corruption is defined as the misuse or betrayal of public trust,  													in order to achieve a personal or private goal, instead of seeking  													the best for the community or country <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T.

This is a serious  													problem for health systems in many places <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nishtar S.

					I would like to point out some similarities regarding corruption  													in healthcare, between India and Peru, two middle-income  													countries in different continents. According to Transparency  													International, India and Peru have a Corruption Perception  													Index of 3.1 and 3.4, respectively (<a href="http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013" target="_blank">http://www.transparency.org/country</a>). This same entity provides the Global Corruption  													Barometer, in which statistics show that 85% of surveyed  													Peruvians assess as "ineffective" the current government's  													actions in the fight against corruption; whereas in India, this  													opinion is held by 44% of surveyed Indians. In both countries,  													many cases of corruption are due to overcharging for supplies,  													infrastructure and new equipment, and to favours that benefit  													only a few.
				</p>
				<p>
					Statistics from the Global Corruption Barometer (<a href="http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013" target="_blank">http://gcb.transparency.org/gcb201011/</a>) indicate that in India, 21% of  													people have come into contact with medical services, and 26%  													of them have paid a bribe in this kind of institution in the last  													twelve months; on the other hand, for Peru it is reported that  													72% of people have come into contact with medical services,  													and of them only 4% have paid a bribe, These differences are  													perhaps a clear indication that, where there is more corruption,  													less people may have the willingness to go to a health facility.  													However, this hypothesis should be further explored in  													different contexts, in order to arrive to a solid conclusion.
				</p>
				<p>
					Corruption is a global problem, and definitely affects a  													population's health <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nishtar S. Corruption in health systems. Lancet. 2010 Sep;376(9744):874." id="3">(3)</a>, no matter where. Therefore, it should  													be included as a research topic worldwide, and among global  													health researchers, in order to fully understand the relationship  													between corruption and health, and its determinants <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Hanf M, Van-Melle A, Fraisse F, Roger A, Carme B, Nacher M. Corruption kills: estimating the global impact of corruption on children deaths. PLoS ONE. 2011;6(11):e26990." id="4">(4)</a>.
				</p>

					The key is to develop strong programmes and strategies  													created to address the characteristics of corruption in a country,  													and that will prevent problems within the health care system,  													in matters of access, inequity and outcomes <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T. Review of corruption in the health sector: theory, methods and interventions. Health Policy Plan. 2008 Mar;23(2):83-94." id="1">(1</a>, <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Huss R, Green A, Sudarshan H, Karpagam S, Ramani K, Tomson G, Gerein N. Good governance and corruption in the health sector: lessons from the Karnataka experience. Health Policy Plan. 2011 Nov;26(6):471-84." id="2">2)</a>. These anticorruption  													strategies should be based on theory, developed  													according to the evidence and adapted to suit the specific  													contexts where they are to be applied <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vian T.
