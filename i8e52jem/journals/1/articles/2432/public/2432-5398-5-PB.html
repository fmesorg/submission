				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The Government of India came out with a slew of notifications to streamline clinical research in the beginning of 2013 in response to the Supreme Court's orders and a Parliamentary Standing Committee's report. The notifications greatly influenced the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of ethics committees across India. In this study, we attempted to objectively evaluate the impact of these notifications on our institutional ethics committee's (IEC) structure, review process, outcomes and administration. The results revealed that though the number of regulatory studies reviewed by our IEC remained the same, the number of studies actually approved decreased with an increase in the turnover time. The number of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported also fell, although the number of meetings held to discuss these SAEs increased significantly. The administrative workload rose with increased documentation. Though the annual income of the IEC fell marginally, the expenses shot up. We believe that the notifications definitely had an impact on the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of our IEC, although it remains to be seen whether they had a real impact on the research participants' safety and well-being.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Schedule Y, first introduced in 1988 as the 8th Amendment of The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, described the requirements for and guidelines on clinical trials in India for the import and manufacture of a new drug. The first applicant for marketing a drug already approved/marketed in other countries had to conduct a clinical trial in at least 100 patients at 3&ndash;4 centres in India before marketing permission was granted. Global studies could be initiated at one phase behind that in the global development cycle (<a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Statutory Rules (GSR) 944 (E) 1988 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://dbtbiosafety.nic.in/Files/CD_IBSC/Files/Cosmetic.pdf" id="1">1</a>). The Indian Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines (<a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, CDSCO, 2001 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://rgcb.res.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Good-Clinical-Practice-Guideline.pdf" id="2">2</a>) were introduced in 2001, and got regulatory standing with the amendment of Schedule Y in 2005 (<a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Statutory Rules (GSR 32) (E). Schedule Y 2005 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://dbtbiosafety.nic.in/act/schedule_y.pdf" id="3">3</a>). Apart from providing comprehensive and pragmatic definitions and setting out the responsibilities of all stakeholders, this amendment also laid down detailed requirements for the conduct of clinical trials. Importantly, the amended Schedule Y (2005) allowed clinical trials in India, parallel to the global development phase. This led to a boom in clinical research in India, and the number of trials registered on <em>clinicaltrials.gov</em> increased from a mere 145 in 2005 to more than 359 in 2010 (<a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Number of clinical trials in India 2005, 2010 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results" id="4">4</a>).

Available from: http://164.100.47.5/newcommittee/reports/englishcommittees" id="8">8</a>) was tabled. The report severely criticised the working of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) (<a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.cdsco.nic.in" id="9">9</a>), the body which is headed by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and is responsible for implementing drug regulations. Public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India (<a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="A Supreme Court Public Interest Litigation (PIL) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/SC%20Order%2030th%20Sept%202013.pdf" id="10">10</a>) gave a further impetus to reforms. In response, the Government of India issued a slew of regulations from early 2013 (Table 1). All stakeholders, including ethics committees, were affected by these notifications. We have two institutional ethics committees, named Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) I and II. Both are registered with the CDSCO and apart from the mandatory compliance with national regulations and guidelines, they are also currently operating according to the international standards set by the Forum for Ethical Review Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific (FERCAP) (<a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Registration of Ethics Committees. GSR72 E, February 8, 2013 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15].

Available from: http://www.fercap-sidcer.org" id="16">16</a>). We felt it was important to assess the impact of these new regulations on the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of our IECs and, therefore, conducted this audit.

				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					This was a retrospective audit. We received administrative approval and an exemption from ethics review from both the IECs (I &amp; II) [EC/OA-95/20/3]. The confidentiality of all documents and stakeholders was maintained strictly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following documents were used as source data: standard operating procedures (SOPs Version 3.1, 4) (<a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Standard Operating Procedures of Institutional ethics Committee (Version 3.1, 4), Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.kem.edu/institutional-ethics-committee/" id="17">17</a>), project registers, project files (whichever needed) and minutes of meetings. The data were collected from June 2011 to September 2014.
				</p>
				<p>
					The variables recorded were:
				</p>
				<ol type="I">
					<li>
						<em><strong>Structure:</strong></em> constitution of the IEC &ndash; number of members, qualifications required, training received by members.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em><strong>Review process:</strong></em> changes in standard operating procedures (SOPs), changes in the review process &ndash; number of queries/comments raised in informed consent document, clinical trial agreement and insurance that pertained to regulatory notifications.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em><strong>Outcomes:</strong></em> number of studies approved and turnover time in days for approval, number of serious adverse events (SAEs) reported, number of SAE sub-committee meetings, number of participants to whom compensation was provided.
					</li>
					<li>
						<em><strong>Administration:</strong></em> office infrastructure, staff, budget, number of documents sent and received.

PLoS One. 2014;9(11):e113356. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113356" id="18">18</a>): our IEC had 23 SOPs in place before the new regulations came into force. After that, two new SOPs were added and two underwent major revision. One of the new SOPs was for the protection of the vulnerable population and the other for constituting a subcommittee to review SAEs. This had earlier been a part of another SOP. The SOPs that underwent major revision pertained to the review of SAE reports and the format for the informed consent document. The authorities to whom SAEs are to be reported, along with the respective timelines, were specified in the revised version, as was the method for review of the SAE report (including the relatedness of the injury to the clinical trial and the need for and quantum of compensation). Regarding the format of the informed consent document, it was now mandatory to include clauses stating compensation for SAEs, relatedness to the clinical trial and details of the nominee in case of payment of compensation for death.

				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Starting from January 2013, the Indian regulators introduced a slew of new rules to streamline the conduct of clinical research in the country. IECs also came under the purview of these new regulatory notifications (<a class="reference" href="#seventeen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Standard Operating Procedures of Institutional ethics Committee (Version 3.1, 4), Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.kem.edu/institutional-ethics-committee/" id="17">17</a>). Our audit indicated that these regulatory notifications on clinical trials had a significant impact on the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of our IECs.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this study, we have, for the first time, attempted to assess the impact of the regulatory notifications on the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of ethics committees by using various indicators as variables. The quality of discussion and the time spent on discussion would have been more robust indicators of the functioning of an IEC, but these were not available to us for analysis. Also, it would have been difficult to grade the quality of discussions even if we studied the minutes. Hence, we took the outcomes of the discussions as indicators. Similar metrics have been used as a self-assessment tool to improve IRB outcomes (<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Adams P, Kaewkungwal J, Limphattharacharoen C, Prakobtham S, Pengsaa K, Khusmith S. Is Your Ethics Committee Efficient? Using &quot;IRB Metrics&quot; as a Self-Assessment Tool for Continuous Improvement at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand. PLoS One. 2014;9(11):e113356. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113356" id="18">18</a>). We have used the same metrics but have observed the impact of the regulatory guidelines made mandatory by the Government of India for regulating research in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					The desired composition of an IEC is described variably in different guidelines. Thus, the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guidelines (Good Clinical Practice; ICHGCP) (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline. Guideline for Good Clinical Practice June 10, 1996 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf" id="19">19</a>) does not mention in detail the exact composition of an IEC, while the ICMR's ethical guidelines (<a class="reference" href="#twenty" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council for Medical Research. Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research on Human Participants [Internet] 2006 [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.icmr.nic.in/bioethics/cc_biothics/index.html" id="20">20</a>) state that the committee should have at least one independent, one non-institutional member, apart from stating that there should be a minimum of seven &ndash; nine and a maximum of 12&ndash;15 members for optimal functioning. The new regulation insisted that an IEC should have at least seven members and 15 at the most. Both our IECs had to be pruned to have only 15 and since our IECs oversee at least 60&ndash;80 regulatory projects, apart from around 350 academic projects annually, this cap on the maximum number of members meant that each member had to review more projects. This regulation put a burden on IECs like ours that reviewed a large number of research projects, necessitating either an increase in the frequency of meetings or the formation of another IEC in the institute. Considering that there are no separate bioethics departments in India (by and large), the workload on the Secretariat, especially the Member Secretaries, increases.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ICMR guidelines clearly state that IEC members must be regularly trained (<a class="reference" href="#nineteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline. Guideline for Good Clinical Practice June 10, 1996 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf" id="19">19</a>). However, there have been reports that IEC members were either not trained or their training was not regularly updated or adequate (<a class="reference" href="#twentyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kuyare MS, Taur SR, Thatte UM.

The importance of the training of Ethics Committee members. Med Law 2009;28(4):649-59." id="25">25</a>). Since our IECs are recognised by the Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Review (SIDCER) (<a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Forum for Ethical Review Committees in Asia and the Western Pacific (FERCAP), SIDCER (Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in Ethical Review) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.fercap-sidcer.org" id="16">16</a>), our IEC members are trained regularly. However, there is a need to formulate guidelines on the frequency of training, content of training (SOP, ethical review, GCP, SAE review, etc), and customised training for medical and non-medical members to increase the IEC's competence to review and approve research. In fact, laying down standards for such training is the need of the hour so that the training is uniform and of a particular level to enable a person to serve on an IEC, especially in view of the norms specified by the Quality Council of India for accreditation of IECs.
				</p>
				<p>
					As per GSR 72 dated February 8, 2013 (<a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Registration of Ethics Committees. GSR72 E, February 8, 2013 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/G.S.R%2072(E)%20dated%2008.02.2013.pdf" id="13">13</a>), the IECs should function according to written SOPs. We have a separate SOP on "Preparation of SOPs for Ethics Committee" SOP01/version 01 dated 14.11.2008. It also mentions the circumstances under which SOPs are to be revised and the procedures to be followed for the same. We had already made a few revisions since 2008. However, the current revision version 4 dated August 22, 2013 was needed to comply with the regulatory guideline.
				</p>
				<p>

The Forum for Ethics Review Committees of India (<a class="reference" href="#thirtyone" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Forum for Ethics Review Committees in India (FERCI) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://ferci.org/" id="31">31</a>) has put up standard SOPs on its website and these could be used by IECs to develop their own SOPs. The government needs to declare what would be considered acceptable SOPs so that the IECs can all function according to one standard.
				</p>
				<p>
					The requirement for soft as well as hard copies of all study related documents and the need for IEC documents to be archived for a minimum of five years have increased the workload of the IEC secretariat, and also created a need for space. This has been challenging.
				</p>
				<p>
					The GSR 53(E) dated January 30, 2013 (<a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="SAE reporting and Compensation. GSR 53E, January 30, 2013 [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.cdsco.nic.in/writereaddata/GSR%2053(E).pdf" id="11">11</a>) mandated that free medical treatment and compensation for research-related injury be provided by the sponsor. The documents reflecting that the sponsor is abiding by this notification are the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) and insurance policy, which need to be critically reviewed by the IEC, especially by the legal expert. After the rules changed, the review of these documents by the IECs and legal experts became more intense, leading to an increased number of queries regarding the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) and Insurance and therefore increased turnover time.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is interesting to note that although the number of projects submitted to our IEC for review before and after the notification remained the same, the number of projects approved by our IEC decreased substantially after the notification. The turnover time increased because the IEC reviewed the Informed Consent Document (ICD), Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA), and insurance policy in greater detail to ensure that they complied with the changed notifications. Revised documents were re-reviewed by the IEC. This, too, increased the turnover time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Surprisingly, there was a decrease in the number of SAEs reported to the IEC. The reason for this could not be ascertained from our study, although personal communication with the investigators indicated that they were being more vigilant towards patients to prevent SAEs. There was underreporting of SAEs, the reasons for which are explained below. We reiterate that the number of SAEs is an indicator of the outcome of the IEC processes, which is mentioned in the revised version now.
				</p>
				<p>
					Adams et al (<a class="reference" href="#eighteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Adams P, Kaewkungwal J, Limphattharacharoen C, Prakobtham S, Pengsaa K, Khusmith S. Is Your Ethics Committee Efficient? Using &quot;IRB Metrics&quot; as a Self-Assessment Tool for Continuous Improvement at the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand. PLoS One. 2014;9(11):e113356. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113356" id="18">18</a>) also reported a similar reduction in the number of SAEs reported. They attributed this to the fact that fewer studies were completed during that period. It is very likely that fewer studies were active during the AFTER period, as the studies which had been approved in the BEFORE period would be recruiting participants and the studies in the AFTER period were still in the process of approval. Moreover, due to these notifications, the investigators and sponsors had to amend their legal documents, such as insurance, the CTA and ICDs. This not only prolonged the turnover time for approvals, but was also reflected in fewer approvals being issued during this period of time. However, the workload of the SAE subcommittee doubled in terms of increase in the frequency of meetings, increased documentation, and more direct communication with the DCGI. The SAE subcommittee as well as the IEC faced many challenges while determining the relatedness of injuries to clinical trials and, therefore, compensation. Although the IEC plays an important role in this activity, it works on secondary information. It is necessary both for the principal investigator and the sponsor to provide complete and clear documentation of the events that led to an SAE, as well as the various associated risk factors, for an accurate determination of the relatedness. Also, there is a need to train IEC members in the methods of determining relatedness. India has shown great originality in making the compensation notification, which is more stringent than that mentioned by the Council for International Organisation of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) (<a class="reference" href="#thirtytwo" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.cioms.ch/" id="32">32</a>) of US-FDA (<a class="reference" href="#thirtythree" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United State-Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) [Internet] [cited 2015 Sep 15]. Available from: http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm" id="33">33</a>). However, it entails several challenges for IECs and appropriate training programmes must be held to empower IECs to perform this duty in a standard manner.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our study revealed a tremendous increase in the workload. To cope with this, our expenditure also increased, but the income did not rise proportionately. There is a need for better institutional funding of IECs, to provide for enough office space and full-time employees. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of the new regulations on the structure, process, outcomes and administration of the IEC. For this reason, we looked at indicators before and after the rules came in. There were no other interventions at that time to explain the change. This is the first attempt to develop indicators to study the effect of the regulations. Our paper is limited by the fact that the findings are borne out only by detailed document analysis.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					To conclude, our study showed that the new notifications had an impact on the structure, review process, outcomes and administration of our IECs. Compliance with the new regulations is a challenge. It is crucial to study how these regulations have affected the participants. There is a need to develop the metrics for assessing the safety and efficacy of research participants as this will make the regulatory changes meaningful in the true sense.
