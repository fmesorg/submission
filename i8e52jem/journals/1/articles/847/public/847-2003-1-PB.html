				<h4>Treating patients with HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Your issue on treating  people with HIV discusses a very important subject. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Health professionals and HIV. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 79-95." id="1">(1)</a> I started my medical  career around the time that HIV was first detected. My first personal encounter  with the disease was some years ago, when a fellow physician and personal friend  was diagnosed as HIV positive. The problems in treating a HIV positive patient  were becoming clear at the time. Unfortunately, they remain the same today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even well-off people  with HIV find it difficult to continue treatment in the long term. For others,  it is just impossible. This is true even after the costs of drugs has come  down. Only one of the 300 or so patients I have treated could afford HAART  therapy (three drugs including a protease inhibitor). Therapy must often be  administered to an entire family. Monitoring tests are also expensive. Add to  this the loss of pay for patient and attendants. Other problems: the family is  stigmatised, immunodeficient people in the hospital are at risk of infection  from nearby patients and passing resistant infections to others, and health  professionals are given inadequate protection against infections of all sorts.

				<h4>What  about the mother?</h4>
				<p>
					This refers to your  article on concerns regarding the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission  (PMTCT) trials. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajalakshami TK. Programme to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV: Some concerns. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 92-93." id="2">(1)</a> NACO's programme to prevent mother to child transmission of  HIV, although ambitious, was awaited by obstetricians all over the country,  particularly in the high prevalence states, for five-six years. Many institutes  have evidence that seropositivity of HIV amongst women who come in for prenatal  care is above 1%, sometimes as high as 4-7%.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is recommended  internationally that all pregnant women should be counselled about the risk  of perinatal transmission of HIV, the effect on the foetus, clinical  manifestations of HIV infection, preventive measures, the availability of  screening tests, the non-availability of curative drugs and vaccines, and the  existence of antiretroviral drugs. After this, they should be offered testing.  This can be described as the most reasonable and effective approach to prevent  transmission of HIV from mother to foetus. (2)
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the primary aims  of counselling pregnant women on HIV is to inform them about the disease, its  mode of transmission and means of prevention. This will lead to primary  prevention of the disease. Such counselling is given in antenatal clinics where  more than 90% of patients receive universal counselling.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another aim of the PMTCT  Programme is to improve antenatal care. This is also being done, and social  workers, nursing staff and counsellors are now counselling women on nutrition,  immunisation, contraception and breast feeding, besides HIV-AIDS. This is a  welcome change. Antenatal waiting rooms are also getting a face-lift, thanks to  the PMTCT programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, though the  programme is well conceived, the choice of intervention, particularly the  ante-retroviral therapy, cannot be justified.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a pregnant woman is  found to be HIV positive (sometimes this is known as early as in the  first trimester) she is not supported with any intervention till the onset of  labour. The drug Nevirapine is offered when a patient has received no antenatal  care and has come to the hospital at the onset of labour. In the PMTCT  programme, except for emergency admissions, most women are supposed to be aware  of their sero-status during the antenatal period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why should women not be  given the advantage of better antiretroviral therapy, a safer mode of delivery  and good infant feeding options? The short course ante-retroviral therapy with  Zidovudine has been successfully tried in Thailand as well as by NACO in their  initial feasibility trials. It is surprising that NACO recommends Nevirapine as  a final intervention programme saying that this the most it can give pregnant  women who are HIV positive. The amount spent on training, workshops and  meetings could be better utilised by giving the target beneficiary the best  treatment rather than the poor compromise chosen by NACO.

				<h4>Everybody  does it</h4>
				<p>
					The case study 'Cross  subsidy in public hospitals' <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sreejit EM. Cross-subsidy in public hospitals. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 100-101." id="3">(1)</a> refers to an everyday practice. We have  regularly called for more than one lumbar puncture needle, more than a few  disposable needles, and more than one endotracheal tube, so that we can use  these on 'poor' patients. I had not thought about the implications of such  practices as the writer has expressed them. I am trying to hold together a  system which is falling apart, while serving my patients. I should challenge  the system. Instead, what I am doing is bailing it out.

				<h4>Questionable  ethics and confused regulation</h4>
				<p>
					Citalopram, an  anti-depressant, was administered by Sun Pharma, on daily labourers as part of  bioequivalence studies demanded by an importer. Some patients developed  complications; one of them developed gangrene as well as renal complications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bioequivalence studies  are done establish the therapeutic equivalence of a branded product and its  generic (non-branded) version. In India there are no guidelines for  bioequivalence studies. Guidelines of the WHO, USFDA and National Institutes of  Health say that such studies should involve, in principle, adult, healthy  volunteers. To what extent underfed volunteers can be called healthy is a moot  question. Worse, it is not clear if they were adequately informed about what  they were getting into.
				</p>
				<p>
					A monograph on Citalopram  says, "The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in depression and  may persist until remission occurs. Therefore, high-risk patients should be  closely supervised throughout therapy with Citalopram hydrobromide and  consideration should be given to the possible need for hospitalisation. In  order to minimise the opportunity for overdose, prescription for Citalopram  should be written for the smallest quantity of drug consistent with good  patient management." Clearly giving Citalopram to 'healthy' people seems  to present a risk. Giving it to underfed, poor people, seems to be an even  worse choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Sun Pharma company  says the trial was part of Phase IV post-marketing surveillance (PMS). However,  PMS is done on patients who have been prescribed the drug for the said  condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					The same monograph on  Citalopram says that, "to date, no information is available on the  pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram in patients with  severely reduced renal function." Did the patients have a history of renal  dysfunction? Did the company check?
				</p>
				<p>
					A WHO guideline on  bioequivalence studies reads, "Health monitoring, before, during and after  the study must be carried out under the supervision of a qualified medical  practitioner licensed in the jurisdiction in which the study is  conducted." The Sun Pharma medical director is quoted in the papers as  saying 'How can we be held responsible?'
				</p>
				<p>
					The researchers claim to  have taken informed consent. This is meaningless when the research subject is  non-literate, poor and otherwise weak in bargaining power.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sun Pharma claims to be  subjecting every batch or export consignment to bioequivalence studies, albeit  at the insistence of the importer. The guidelines do not mention such a  practice which is both absurd and fraught with dangers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soon after this  controversy, Sun Pharma advertised in the newspapers asking for volunteers for  trials. Is the public entitled to know what these trials are for and which  ethical guidelines are followed? If they are for bioequivalence will the Drug  Controller explain why we need bioequivalence studies for every export  consignment? If Parliament could pass a law for the right to information  in public affairs for the country, what about the right of the public at large  to know what kind of trials are going on, on whom and for what purpose?
				</p>
				<p>
					The recent  post-liberalisation hype is to project India as a favored destination for  clinical trials. But our very advantages - a large population, genetic  diversity and low costs - are compounded by poor or no regulatory laws and  ignorance on research ethics and law among the public and even health  professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					The application fee for  phase I clinical trials will be Rs 50,000 and the fees for both phase II and  phase III trials are just Rs 25,000 each. Many companies will of course get  'informed consent' from illiterate poor people who will be targeted with  drugs known and unknown. Citalopram is just an indicator.

				<h4>Ethical use of animals in scientific research</h4>
				<p>
					A number of articles  have appeared in the press recently regarding a visit to the National Institute  of Immunology (NII), New Delhi, by an inspection team of the Committee for the  Prevention of Cruelty in Scientific Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The  articles were extremely critical of the condition of the monkeys kept in the  NII and its use of animals in scientific research. One article stated that the  CPCSEA had recommended closure of the primate house at the NII, in effect  terminating all research at the Institute involving these animals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Delhi Science Forum (DSF),  a non-profit public interest organisation of scientists, technologists and  social scientists working in areas of science and technology policy, is  extremely concerned at these developments at NII which are but the latest of a  series of similar actions by CPCSEA in different institutions. These actions  reveal disturbing trends in the structure and functioning of CPCSEA and also  have serious implications for the future of scientific research in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					DSF designated a  three-member team to visit NII and examine the issue covering not only the  conditions and use of animals at NII but also the functioning of the CPCSEA.  DSF spoke with CPCSEA team members and sought their views but was unable to  obtain a copy of the team's report from either the team or CPCSEA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Contrary to the  allegation that animals are kept in overcrowded enclosures, DSF found that the  207 primates at NII are kept in 13 large outdoor enclosures (5 more are under  construction) and additional indoor enclosures for observations and rotation, with  small chambers in some outdoor enclosures with provision for heating or cooling  depending on season. Enclosures are cleaned four times a day, about an hour  after each feeding period. NII also has operating theatres and three full-time  veterinarians. Therefore, the animal facilities at NII provide ample space, are  in good condition, and are well-maintained.
				</p>
				<p>
					Against the allegation  that over 90% of the monkeys are infected with TB, NII records and DSF's  observations show that only 2 adult monkeys out of 207 have TB, and these,  along with one female's infant, are in quarantine, under observation and  treatment. NII records show that all incoming monkeys are quarantined and  tested for TB, such testing also being conducted regularly for all the monkeys,  with infected monkeys being treated and painlessly put to sleep as per approved  procedure if not cured.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the more  sensational allegations was that the monkeys at NII were undernourished. DSF  examined the monkeys' dietary and nutritional status besides feeding practices  at NII. Monkeys at NII are fed four times a day, with special pelletised feeds,  channa, bread with vitamin and other nutritional supplements (both additional  for pregnant and lactating animals), fruits and vegetables. Monkeys at NII thus  obtain more than the internationally recommended standard of 70-100 kCal/kg of  bodyweight per day.
				</p>
				<p>
					NII has Standard  Operating Procedures for care of animals and their use in experiments which are  monitored and overseen by NII's Ethics Committee. DSF found not only that  conditions and treatment of animals at NII were satisfactory but also that  records were basically sound, properly maintained and procedures broadly  conforming to international standards were being followed. Of course, there is  always room for improvement and NII scientists and managers appeared open and  willing to discuss any measures that may be recommended in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not all the CPCSEA team  members agree with the opinions as reflected in sections of the press and  reiterated by some members to DSF. This makes the non-availability of the team  report all the more serious and, if action is being taken or contemplated based  on such unsubstantiated individual opinions, this raises grave concerns about  pre-determined, motivated and biased functioning of CPCSEA.
				</p>
				<p>
					DSF explicitly  recognises the necessity for regulation of use of animals in scientific  research to ensure ethical and proper treatment of animals and pursuit of  research in accordance with clearly prescribed rules. The fact that the CPCSEA  is a statutory body, with rules governed by law, is a positive aspect not only  ensuring compliance but also benefiting scientific research and practice. The  rules under the relevant Act are also broadly as endorsed by the scientific  community in India and abroad.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the CPCSEA as  constituted gives representation to scientific departments and the research  community, apart from animal rights activists, in practice and in the manner it  functions, the latter have virtually taken over the CPCSEA and its various  bodies, and have subverted the statutory body. CPCSEA today appears to act not  to regulate the use of animals in scientific research but to completely stop it  now and prevent it in future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some fundamental defects  in the constitution of the CPCSEA under the relevant Act urgently require to be  addressed. The NII episode, as well as previous ones at JNU, Indian Institute  of Science, AIIMS, National Institute of Nutrition and other research  institutions in both the public and private sectors, brings out sharply that  the CPCSEA now appears to be functioning as police, prosecutor, judge and  hangman, resulting in arbitrariness and lack of transparency and  accountability.
				</p>
				<p>
					The CPCSEA should be  overhauled, and its advisory, inspection and other bodies completely  reconstituted, with due representation of the scientific community apart from  those with concerns for animal welfare. Inspection reports should be shared  with the concerned institution for greater transparency, to enable peer review  and full participation of research institutions in the regulatory process
				</p>
				<p>
					CPCSEA should be brought  under the ministry of science and technology with proper structures and  mechanisms for transparency and accountability
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of NII, no  action should be taken on the basis of this inspection team's report since the  entire process has been deeply flawed and vitiated.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, DSF calls upon  the scientific community to vigorously debate these issues, evolve a consensus  and work towards a thorough overhaul and reform of this important regulatory  body.

				<h4>Abortion pill or murder marketed?</h4>
				<p>
					I draw your attention to  the distribution and marketing of Mifepristone and Misoprostol by Sun, Cipla  and Zydus Alidac Pharmaceuticals. These drugs for abortion are supplied to  practising gynaecologists to be given to patients after obtaining their  consent. The money is to be collected from the patient by the physician, who in  turn turns it over to the drug representative. This is highly irregular,  unethical and illegal and cannot be equated with drug dispensing by primary  physicians at their dispensary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, the drug is  meant for the medical termination of pregnancy (MTP). This must be done  according to the MTP Act, 1971, only by an approved physician, in an approved  centre and for approved conditions (threat to mother's life, congenital  anomalies, rape-induced pregnancy and pregnancy due to contraceptive failure,  the last only in the case of married women).
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the  promotional literature, the pill is to be distributed for abortion at home.  This is contrary to the provisions of the MTP Act. It makes no difference  that in the consent form circulated by drug companies and to be signed by the  patient, the patient agrees to take the pill in the physician's clinic. According  to the MTP Act, a gynaecologist's consulting chamber is not recognised for the  purpose of MTP. In any case, the abortion takes place at home and is not in  conformity with the MTP Act. The possibility of failure and profuse bleeding is  substantial. This would expose the patient to grave risks, especially in rural  settings. The risk is greater for unwed women for whom pregnancy is looked down  upon, and who may therefore not contact proper services and may abort and bleed  at home. Besides, the pill is being distributed through qualified and  unqualified medical practitioners in the country, though under the MTP Act only  a practitioner registered with the appropriate Medical Council can terminate a  pregnancy. This is virtually marketing murder for paltry monetary gains with  the open connivance of medical professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, the distribution  of full-text articles reproduced from the New England Journal of Medicine,  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Journal of American  Medical Women's Association as promotional material, with or without the  permission of the journals and the authors, is unethical. It amounts to lending  the name by authors for promotion of a brand/drug and amounts to 'association'  under the MCI Act.
				</p>
				<p>
					This marketing strategy  to promote the abortion pill as an 'in-house' abortion method is dangerous and  will claim hundreds of lives in the prevalent health care scenario in India.  Unsafe abortion under the garb of MTP is already claiming many lives in the  country.
