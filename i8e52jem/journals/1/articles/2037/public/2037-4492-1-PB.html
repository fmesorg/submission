				<h4>What  about the mother?</h4>
				<p>
					This refers to your  article on concerns regarding the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission  (PMTCT) trials. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rajalakshami TK. Programme to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV: Some concerns. Issues in Medical Ethics 2002; 10: 92-93." id="1">(1)</a> NACO's programme to prevent mother to child transmission of  HIV, although ambitious, was awaited by obstetricians all over the country,  particularly in the high prevalence states, for five-six years. Many institutes  have evidence that seropositivity of HIV amongst women who come in for prenatal  care is above 1%, sometimes as high as 4-7%.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is recommended  internationally that all pregnant women should be counselled about the risk  of perinatal transmission of HIV, the effect on the foetus, clinical  manifestations of HIV infection, preventive measures, the availability of  screening tests, the non-availability of curative drugs and vaccines, and the  existence of antiretroviral drugs. After this, they should be offered testing.  This can be described as the most reasonable and effective approach to prevent  transmission of HIV from mother to foetus. (2)
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the primary aims  of counselling pregnant women on HIV is to inform them about the disease, its  mode of transmission and means of prevention. This will lead to primary  prevention of the disease. Such counselling is given in antenatal clinics where  more than 90% of patients receive universal counselling.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another aim of the PMTCT  Programme is to improve antenatal care. This is also being done, and social  workers, nursing staff and counsellors are now counselling women on nutrition,  immunisation, contraception and breast feeding, besides HIV-AIDS. This is a  welcome change. Antenatal waiting rooms are also getting a face-lift, thanks to  the PMTCT programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, though the  programme is well conceived, the choice of intervention, particularly the  ante-retroviral therapy, cannot be justified.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a pregnant woman is  found to be HIV positive (sometimes this is known as early as in the  first trimester) she is not supported with any intervention till the onset of  labour. The drug Nevirapine is offered when a patient has received no antenatal  care and has come to the hospital at the onset of labour. In the PMTCT  programme, except for emergency admissions, most women are supposed to be aware  of their sero-status during the antenatal period.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why should women not be  given the advantage of better antiretroviral therapy, a safer mode of delivery  and good infant feeding options? The short course ante-retroviral therapy with  Zidovudine has been successfully tried in Thailand as well as by NACO in their  initial feasibility trials. It is surprising that NACO recommends Nevirapine as  a final intervention programme saying that this the most it can give pregnant  women who are HIV positive. The amount spent on training, workshops and  meetings could be better utilised by giving the target beneficiary the best  treatment rather than the poor compromise chosen by NACO.
