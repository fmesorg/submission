					The  promotion of any irrational drug combination is bound to be unethical. It is  also unethical to promote an irrational claim. The need of determining an  ethical code of promotion of medicine is important. The following codes were  available for study:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						IFPMA code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices- updated in 1994
					</li>
					<li>
						Criteria for medicinal drug promotion-prepared by WHO in 1988
					</li>
					<li>
						Guidelines on IFPMA Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices-prepared by OPPI, downloaded from their       web page in August 2003
					</li>
					<li>
						International Code on Pharmaceuticals-prepared by Health Action International (HAI)
					</li>
					<li>
						This is an attempt to compare different codes towards developing a suitable code for India.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Objectives  of the codes</h4>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA code says, 'The international pharmaceutical industry is committed to the  improvement of the health of the mankind through research and development of  new medicines and production and marketing of pharmaceutical products of  reliable quality, in accordance with internationally defined standards of good  practice.'
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  a new medicine? Many new drugs do not have any significant advantage over  existing drugs. Many are produced with mere molecular manipulation to overcome  a competitive edge and medicines with the same effect are sold at higher  prices.
				</p>
				<p>
					The WHO  code states: 'The main objective of ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion  is to support and encourage the improvement of health care through the rational  use of medicinal drugs.' The ethical criteria start from the validity of the  drug itself: is the drug or combination of drugs rational?
				</p>
				<p>
					Today  another important question is that of the price of medicines. In this context,  the HAI code is explicit: 'The aim of this code is to enable consumers,  particularly those from the developing countries, to procure safe and effective  pharmaceuticals essential to their real health needs, at a cost they can  afford.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Another  question arising from IFPMA's code is that of 'internationally defined  standards of good practice'. Is it possible to have such a standard when so  many codes exist, all for voluntary implementation?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Applicability  of the codes</h4>
				<p>
					While  IFPMA confines the applicability of its code to its member organisations and  affiliates in the industry, WHO expanded its scope to people in all walks of  life:&nbsp; governments; the pharmaceutical industry (manufac-turers and  distributors); the promotion industry (adver-tising agencies, market research  organisations and the like); health personnel involved in the prescription,  dispensing, supply and distribution of drugs; universities and other teaching  institutions; professional associations; patients and consumer groups; and the  professional and general media (including publishers and editors of medical  journals and related publications). This definition of applicability is widest  of all the codes. However, as things stand, it is a futile statement and does  not enable corrective measures for violation of the code.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Scope  of the codes</h4>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA code states that promotional activities within the scope of the code  include direct to-consumer advertising, where this is permitted under local  laws. In many Third World countries, no regulatory law for promotion of  medicines exists. What will be the responsibility of the industry and who will  monitor them?
				</p>
				<p>
					The HAI  code defines the scope in different sectors such as drug registration;  registration of new drugs; pre-registration clinical trials of new drugs;  provision of information; labelling; package inserts and promotional materials;  sales promotion of pharmaceutical products; pricing; sales and distribution;  pharmaceutical technology; and research and development. The HAI code also  explains and defines each of these sectors. In the absence of such definitions,  the scope of the Code become futile-a problem evident in several clauses of the  IFPMA code.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Definition  of promotion in the codes</h4>
				<p>
					The  definition of 'promotion' is vital. WHO has stated, 'In this context, promotion  refers to all informational and persuasive activities by manufacturers and  distributors, the effect of which is to induce the prescription, supply,  purchase and/or use of medicinal drugs.'
				</p>
				<p>
					For  some reason the IFPMA code did not feel the need to provide such a definition.  It states: 'Promotional materials for pharmaceutical products should be  accurate, fair and objective and presented in such a way as to conform not only  to legal requirements but also to high ethical standards and to be in good  taste.' This statement is vague.
				</p>
				<p>
					OPPI  guideline have been more specific regarding promotion, defining it as:  'Promotional material on pharmaceutical products: printed literature (package  inserts, data sheets, detail/visual aids, flip-charts, leave-behinds, mailings  and advertisements); audio-visuals; sponsored symposia/conferences/guest  lectures; gift items; information through medical representative training.'
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  OPPI has ignored advertising through the electronic media, gifts, literature or  display materials given to wholesalers and chemists, the sponsoring of  individuals to attend meetings/conferences, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO has  also defined 11 specific criteria for advertisements. OPPI mentions some four  criteria and the IFPMA code mentions three. IFPMA categorises advertisements as  'all advertisements' and 'full advertisements'. Its code states that  contraindications, side-effects and precautions must be mentioned only in 'full  advertisements'. The HAI code defines advertisements as: 'Any representation  conveyed by any means whatever for the purpose of promoting, directly or  indirectly, the distribution or sale of any drug.'
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Medical  representatives</h4>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA code mentions that medical representatives must be trained with  sufficient medical and technical knowledge. They should also collect  information from professionals about the use of a product.
				</p>
				<p>
					The WHO  criteria state that training must include updated and continuing training. The  training should also include ethical conduct including training on codes. Also,  medical representatives should not offer inducements to prescribers and  dispensers, and prescribers and dispensers should not solicit such inducements.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  OPPI guidelines in this respect are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Adequate training should include  information on basic medical sciences such as anatomy, physiology, microbiology  and pharmacology.
					</li>
					<li>
						Sufficient medical knowledge should be given regarding  aetiopathology and clinical aspects of the disease for which the product is  used.
					</li>
					<li>
						The representatives should be properly trained to impart  information in an accurate and scientific manner. There is no reference to the  appropriate conduct of a medical representative (MR). The company may refuse to  take responsibility for the claims or quality of the campaign made by an MR.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The HAI  code adds an important element by stating that the number of MRs 'must not  exceed one representative per promoted pharmaceutical product per 500 registered  physicians or other prescribers.' With the large product ranges of companies in  India, this number would become outrageous. The number of MRs in each company  must be restricted but so should the frequency of visits. The IFPMA only states  that 'the frequency of printed material to healthcare professionals should be  reasonable.'
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Distribution  of free samples</h4>
				<p>
					The  OPPI remains quiet in this respect. The IFPMA states that 'samples may be given  to prescribing professionals to familiarise them with the products, enable them  to gain experience with the products in their practice, or on request.' WHO  guidelines are more lenient, considering that free samples may be used by the  weaker sections of society. However, in India, samples of old drugs are  regularly distributed in large quantities. In some instances sale packs are  also used as samples and these packs do not even contain the words 'free  sample'. There is no regulation on the giving of samples. Some companies use  the strategy of providing samples proportionate to the product's sales. This  may lead to violation of ethics since samples should not be considered  saleable.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Symposia  and scientific meetings</h4>
				<p>
					The  WHO code acknowledges the need for such meetings to be sponsored by  manufacturers and distributors, and permits the giving of gifts or hospitality  but they should be 'secondary'. The code states that 'any support to individual  participants should not be conditional upon any obligation to promote any  medical product.' This is absurd because obligation is implicit in such a  relationship. Why else should a company sponsor individuals?
				</p>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA code states: 'payment of reasonable honoraria and reimbursement of  out-of-pocket expenses, including travel, for speakers/prescribers are  customary and proper,' but 'companies should not pay travel costs of persons  accompanying invited members of the medical and allied professionals.'
				</p>
				<p>
					In  India, virtually no professional meetings are possible without the sponsorship  of drug companies. In most of these meetings the main events are sparsely  attended but the funfair sponsored by drug companies are always crowded. There  is no limit to the money spent here and no sign of modesty. Companies compete  with each other to sponsor in more and more exotic ways.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Gifts</h4>
				<p>
					Gifts  found in professionals' offices vary from trifles to expensive items, and most  are unrelated to their work. Quoting the IFPMA code, OPPI states: 'Promotional  items of insignificant value, provided free of charge, are permissible as long  as they are related to the healthcare provider's work and/or entail a benefit  to patients.' Gift items should bear the brand names of the product and the  generic name, only if possible. The value of the gift should not be so high as  to oblige doctors to prescribe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though  simple gifts may not directly influence prescription practices, they would not  be distributed unless they had some related impact. It has been pointed out  that a policy of limiting gift size is unlikely to eliminate bias, because  'even small gifts can subtly bias how arguments are evaluated, they can be  surprisingly influential.'
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Other issues</h4>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA code does not provide guidelines on pre-registration of a drug which is  left to the regulation of the respective countries. Similarly, there is no  mention of the procedure to be followed in post-marketing surveillance.  However, WHO discusses both these issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the  WHO code dates back to 1988, it has not addressed problems related to  advertising in the electronic media. The IFPMA code deals with both the  electronic media and advertisements on the Internet, but is vague and has  nothing to say on web pages created by drug companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  IFPMA has many details on complaints regarding the code's violation but global  experience shows that few complaints have been entertained and there is almost  no redressal.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Regulations  in India</h4>
				<p>
					The  less said about this the better. We have a Magic Remedies (Objectionable  Advertisement) Act, 1954. It has only one relevant clause, Clause 4, on  misleading advertisements which: directly or indirectly gives false impression  regarding the true character of the drug; makes a false claim for the drug, or  is otherwise false or misleading in any particular material. After almost 50  years, surely it is time to develop a code on pharmaceutical promotional  practices that is suitable for India, and the appropriate legislation to  enforce it.
