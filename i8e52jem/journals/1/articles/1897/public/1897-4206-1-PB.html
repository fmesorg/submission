				<h4>Sabnis phenomenon, bystanders and role models</h4>
				<p>
					The 'Sabnis phenomenon" <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Murlidhar V: The Sabnis episode - the final act in the corruption of university examinations in the medical sciences. Medical ethics 1994;2(2):6-7" id="1">(1)</a> is a glaring example of the selfishness and greed that has overtaken the medical profession. The profession has changed from being 'merciful' to being 'mercenary'. But then, nepotism and corruption have invaded all sections and all levels of our society and the medical profession is only a part of it.

					Recently I came to know that these days the internee student need not attend his 'posting'. A completion certificate can be obtained by paying the medical officer (at the rate of Rs. 10 per day of absence). I know of an instance when a medical officer collected, at the end of a three-month posting of a batch, around a thousand rupees. The Dean and many others are aware that such a practice prevails but they feel that any action for changing the situation will be futile as it will be overwhelmed by the system. So all (including myself) prefer to play a 'bystander role' <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pilgaokar A: Bystander role of professionals: ethical considerations beyond medical practice. Medical Ethics 1994; 2(2): 3-4." id="2">(2)</a>.

					Changing the morals of a society is a Herculean task. The change cannot be imposed from outside - it must come from within the individual. It is impossible - even for a dedicated reformist to reverse the gear suddenly. Any attempt at doing so will cause a breakdown of the system. The reformist is then doomed to frustration. The direction has to be changed gradually and many of us can help by being ethical role models. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nagral S: Wanted: ethical role models.
