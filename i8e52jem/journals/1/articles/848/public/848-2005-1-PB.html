					'What difference      does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad      destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name      of liberty or democracy?' <em>Non-violence in peace and war</em> &mdash; Mahatma Gandhi      (1869-1948)

					Another war in Iraq is sadly under way and in these early days, it is      already apparent that the hopes of a short surgical conflict a.k.a. Kosovo      or a blitzkrieg like the last Gulf war, were wildly misplaced. Those      expecting the Iraqi military and the populace to rapidly capitulate in the      face of 'shock and awe' tactics of massive air-strikes, are 'surprised' by      the resilience of an opposition facing certain defeat. To others who      remember the tenacity of the people of Viet Nam and Afghanistan, this is      hardly surprising and portends a long bruising campaign ahead. In any      event, unprecedented dust storms in the region and steadily growing list of      civilian casualties serve to remind us that despite modern technology, war      is indeed a dirty affair. The sad fact remains that global superpowers have      yet again chosen to spend billions on destroying infrastructure and lives      for gains that are both debatable and unpredictable.

					It is not the      purpose of this article to debate the genesis of the Iraq conflict, nor the      issue of whether a ruthless tyrant like Saddam Hussain deserves any slack.      The issue in question is whether the end justifies the means and if it is      ethical to impose such a price on a nation that has suffered long at the      hand of a brutal domestic regime and global sanctions. Even though one may      not have witnessed human suffering as a direct result of conflict and war      injuries, such as that witnessed in Afghanistan <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bhutta ZA.

					The land of Iraq, or      Mesopotamia of old, is no stranger to conflict and brutality. The simmering      strife and conflicts between successive generations of Assyrians, Greeks      and Suljuks paled in comparison to the savage destruction of Baghdad by the      Mongols in 1258. The Mongols not only destroyed all forms of art and      culture and scholarship in Iraq, but also the canal head works, leading to      the relegation of Iraq to economic wasteland for almost six centuries. It      is interesting to note that the British were the first among the western      states to invade Iraq in 1914 to protect their interest against the      perceived pro-German policies of the Ottoman Empire. The decades of      conflict that followed eventually saw the emergence of Iraq as a sovereign      state in 1932 followed by the first military coup of the modern Arab world      in 1936. The subsequent emergence of the Baath party posed a direct      challenge to the monarchy and the promotion of pan-Arabism. The emergence      of Ahmad Hasan al Bakr and eventually Saddam Hussain by early 1979,      followed a series of brutal internal conflicts with the Kurds as well a      series of border disputes with Iran and Kuwait <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Khadduri M. The role of the military in Iraqi society. In: Fisher SN (ed). The military in the Middle East. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1963:41-51." id="4">(4)</a>. The outbreak of the      Iran-Iraq war in September 1980 led to unprecedented loss of life and      property and severe economic misery for the people of Iran and Iraq. Saddam      Hussain's reprehensible decision to invade Iran was akin to the acts of the      ancient rulers of Mesopotamia who, fearing internal strife and foreign      conquest, also engaged in frequent battles with the peoples of the      highlands. The folly of the invasion of Iran by Saddam pales in the wake of      the invasion of Kuwait in 1989 and the consequences of the Gulf War that      followed. It is highly debatable if the common man in the street in Iraq      has had any meaningful input in the affairs of the state. As reprehensible      as it may be, the current Iraqi regime, and the weaponry it possesses, is a      direct product of vested interests by western powers. When confronted with      the choice during the Iran-Iraq war, most western states blatantly      supported Saddam Hussain and steadily poured in military technology and      hardware. Even the horrors of chemical and possibly biological warfare      perpetrated by Saddam Hussain were conveniently ignored. It is only when      'the devil of their own creation' turned upon Kuwait with the consequent      threat to global oil supplies that the West woke up to confront Saddam.      However, in an interesting choice of tactics, once faced with the choice of      eliminating Saddam and his government after a clear military victory, the      military command led by General Colin Powell chose not to do so. Instead, a      draconian and incomprehensible decade of economic sanctions followed, which      hit the most vulnerable in Iraqi society, especially its women and      children. To illustrate, immediately following the Gulf war it was      estimated that under-5 mortality in Iraq had increased three-fold <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ascherio A, Chase R, Cote T, Dehaes G, Hoskins E, Laaouej J, et al. Effect of the Gulf war on infant and child mortality in Iraq. N Engl J Med 1992;327:931-6." id="5">(5)</a> and      subsequently the rates of malnutrition were estimated to have doubled <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Central Statistical Organisations.

					Today as the world      once again sets upon to impose war on the region, precious little thought      is being given to the collateral effects and consequences of war. In a      series of assessments Medact estimates that the number of casualties during      and immediately following the invasion of Iraq could range from      48,000-260,000, with an estimated 200,000 deaths from post-war adverse      effects due to a breakdown of the health system <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Medact. Collateral damage: The health and environmental costs of war on Iraq. [http://www.medact.org]" id="7">(7)</a>. Despite the widespread      claims of a short, sharp decisive conflict, an internal confidential      document by the United Nations predicts several hundred thousand deaths and      a health and nutritional crisis of epidemic proportions <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations. Likely humanitarian scenarios. Available from the Campaign Against Sanctions on Iraq [http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/casi]" id="8">(8)</a>. In the      words of Jean Paul-Sartre (1905-80), 'when the rich wage war, it's the poor      who die'. In an increasingly unipolar world, none of these issues, or the      likely regional and global political fallout of the Iraq war, seem to be      making much headway. The protests by the millions marching in the streets      of Europe and Asia are rejected out of hand, while blatant and unethical      attempts at economic coercion and political blackmail to swing the vote in      the Security Council continue unabated. Few realize that while the      perpetrators of the Iraq war might achieve their short-term goals of regime      change, few have the stomach to oversee long-term development objectives      and the region may be left to fend for itself. It is sobering to note that      the same powers that spent over US$ 10 billion on dislodging the Taliban in      Afghanistan, have not been able to fulfil even a third of the promised      commitments for economic assistance to the country. Today the world is      again poised to spend over US$ 85 billion on the most expensive war of the      new millennium, yet the Global Fund languishes for a fraction of the funds      and the floundering global maternal and child health intervention      programmes can be rejuvenated for a fiftieth of the amount! Not to protest      against this madness would be unconscionable. To offer war as the only      solution to 'help' the people of Iraq is an affront to justice and      humanity.
