				<h4>NATIONAL BIOETHICS CONFERENCE - 3</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Theme : Governance of healthcare - ethics, equity and justice</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dates: November 17, 18, 19 and 20, 2010</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Venue: New Delhi</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					For the last 17 years, <em>Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME)</em> has been involved in promoting ethics in healthcare: in clinical practice, public health and research; in institutional functioning and health policy. In this process it has also helped in the development of bioethics in India, as a discipline as well as a movement for healthcare reforms.
				</p>
				<p>
					IJME provides a platform for the publication of peer-reviewed, evidence- and experienced-based bioethics literature. In addition, since 2005, the <em>IJME</em> National Bioethics Conference (NBC) has provided an opportunity for collaboration among organisations and institutions from biomedicine, public health, social sciences, law and the non-governmental sector. This collaboration brings together practitioners and scholars for reflection and debate on the ethical issues that confront our healthcare system.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first NBC was organised in Mumbai in November 2005, by 20 collaborating organisations. The second NBC was organised in Bangalore in December 2007, by 38 collaborating organisations. Participation in the NBCs has been highly encouraging the first attracted over 300 and the second over 600 participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the organisation of the NBC, while <em>IJME</em> provides a platform, sets the theme and assists in running the secretariat and in logistics, the conference programme is drawn up and the conference is conducted through the democratic participation of representatives of the collaborating organisations who constitute the National Organising Committee (NOC).
				</p>
				<p>
					The NBC is also partly financed through a collective process. Each collaborating organisation bears the cost of sending one representative to the NOC and sponsors the registration, travel, accommodation, and other expenses of six participants of its choice. Other participants are required to register and bear the cost of participation. IJME and the Centre for Studies in Ethics and Rights mobilise funds for the main event, the expenses of plenary speakers and fellowships for some of the paper writers and participants. The scientific committee of the NOC reviews and selects papers for presentation in scient ific sessions and proposals for the organisation of workshops and other events.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please contact the national secretariat of the third NBC for more information and to join as a collaborating organisation.
