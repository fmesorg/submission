			<h3>A brief note on THE FORUM FOR MEDICAL ETHICS (FME)</h3>

			<!-- Horizontal Line -->

			<div class="section">
				<p>
					Alarmed  by the current state of affairs, a group of concerned doctors have formed the  FME to focus attention on the need for ethical norms and practices in our  profession. The FME fielded a team for election to the Maharashtra Medical  Council. (Dr. Kamath narrates this story in our opening essay.) It seeks to  form a cohesive organisation of doctors faithful to the principles of ethical  medicine. Together we can reinforce those who stay true to these principles,at  times against great odds. We also hope to be able to convince those who, for  various reasons, have strayed from the straight and narrow path, of the need to  mend their ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  forum will provide the stage for discussions on ticklish situations (such as  the one on page 5) and help evolve a consensus on actions consistent with  ethical practice. In time, it hopes to be able to create panels of experts who  can produce guidelines and white papers on such topics as renal transplants  using unrelated donors, the role of public and private clinics in the treatment  of patients with AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome), brain death and  what constitutes adequate fee for a given medical or surgical procedure.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  also hope to increase awareness of patients on what they should expect from  their doctors as a matter of right as well as what the doctor has a right to  expect of them. Highlighting rights and responsibilities may be a potent means  of ensuring strong public opinion in favour of ethical practices and, at the  same time, easing the task of the honest and truthful doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  hope you will find this endeavour worthy of your participation. We are well  aware of the pressures of your schedule but hope you will find the necessary  time in view of the urgency of the situation and crying need for all of us to  put our profession in order.

				<h4>WHY IS THIS NEWSLETTER NECESSARY?</h4>
				<p>
					Whilst the FME is in the process of organising periodic activities such as  meetings (perhaps on a monthly basis) of study groups on specific subjects,  seminars and lectures on relevant topics and burning issues, it is felt that a  regular channel of communication between all members will help in furthering  our goals. The newsletter will also carry details of proceedings of such  meetings for the benefit of those who could not attend and as a permanent  record.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  newsletter will not only provide essays, results of surveys and reviews that  provide food for thought but will also feature a correspondence column where we  can carry on meaningful dialogues, air our grievances, pose problems for which  our colleagues may have answers and focus attention on vital issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such  an effort can only succeed if there is active participation by many. Please  contribute your thoughts and experiences. These could be of help to us and to  others.
