				<h4>Flaunting our 'honours'</h4>
				<p>
					We, medicos, are known to be vain peacocks strutting around, spreading our  qualifications and professional feathers. There was a time when a cardiologist  in Mumbai sported degrees and honours totalling a record 65 alphabetical  characters, topped by the then popular 'SEM'. In desperation, Bombay Telephones  ruled that henceforth it would refrain from printing degrees and  qualifications!
				</p>
				<p>
					We often wonder to whose good such display is  directed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternative medicine is a movement geared  towards weaning patients away from the glamour and glitter of allopathy. Alas!  There too, overkill is achieved by prefixing and suffixing names of leading  lights in a manner that, unhelpably, betrays vanity.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an example in point, we quote from <em>Holistic  Mediscan</em>, July 1996. Therein,  a dignitary is introduced as "Lord Pandit Professor Dr. Sir Anton Jayasuriya,  Chancellor OICUM". It may be that this has some rationale in our age, governed  as it is by imports from Madison Avenue - not only should drugs sell, but so  should doctors!
