                The disposal of medical wastes has assumed critical
                proportions especially in cities. The system in India
                whereby there are numerous private nursing homes
                located all over the city, in both residential and commercial
                areas, has meant that the wastes are widespread. The current
                practice is to dump the wastes in the public bins or to bribe
                the municipal sanitary staff to clear it along with other wastes.
                One can therefore see blood-soaked bandages, sharps and
                sometimes even human parts in public dumping grounds.

                The government of India had notified norms for the
                disposal of medical wastes, but up till now, at least in Chennai,
                they have not been effectively implemented. Recently, a new
                secretary, Ms. Sheela Rani Chunkath, was appointed to the
                Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. It looks as if she is
                determined to change the situation. All hospitals, both public
                and private have been told to establish medical waste
                disposal systems in accordance with the law or face penal
                action. An association of private hospitals pleaded for some
                time, and they have been given till the beginning of 2001.

                Simultaneously, steps have also been taken to improve the
                air quality in Chennai. The TNPCB has said that it will be
                making random emission checks on vehicles from January
                2001. Quarterly emission checks had been made mandatory
                two years ago, but after the initial fanfare, had not been
                implemented. Many checking centres closed down for want
                of patronage. The two major vehicular pollutants had been
                identified as the buses of the Metropolitan Transport
                Corporation, and lorries. An attempt by the TNPCB to bring
                to book the errant lorries, led to an assault on the staff of the
                TNPCB. But 2001 may see them falling in line if the
                government backs its secretary.

                The TNPCB has begun to publish weekly data on air quality
                in Chennai. This is extremely useful because informal data
                have suggested that respiratory diseases are on the increase
                in Chennai. The data may force the government and citizens
                to improve the situation before conditions deteriorate to
                what is currently prevalent in Delhi.
                </p>

                Amidst all these attempts to check pollution in Chennai, it
                was strange to see the government's move to locate a bus
                stand in the Hospital for Thoracic Medicine in Tambaram.
                This hospital was set up by the British and is popularly
                known as the TB Sanatorium. In fact, the suburban railway
                station is called TB Sanatorium. In the last few years it has
                become a haven for patients with Acquired Immuno-
                Deficiency Syndrome. The director, Dr. CN Devainayagam,
                who retired at the end of November 2000, made it a policy to
                admit all patients with AIDS. This is in marked contrast to
                the situation in most other hospitals where every attempt is
                made to get rid of these patients. Since anti-retroviral therapy
                is not available, a trial of Siddha preparations is underway.
                Importantly, these people, most of whom have been abandoned by their families, are given shelter and food. It is
                tragic, therefore, that an attempt is being made to reduce the
                size of this hospital's sylvan surroundings by putting a busstand
                in it. There is a hope that the government may review
                its decision in light of the protests that have been made.
                Meanwhile, one must wait and see if the new director will be
                as aggressive as Dr. Deivanayagam in protecting the interests of the patients.

                For the last three years the Royal College of Surgeons of
                Edinburgh has been conducting examinations in Chennai.
                The situation is rather strange because the government of
                India does not recognise the qualification. There is no doubt,
                however, that the medical community &mdash; and perhaps the
                general public &mdash; feels that the qualification is prestigious.
                This is why, although the examination fees are high, there
                are enough candidates to make it worthwhile for the Royal
                College to fly in examiners. It is worth analysing why a full
                half century after independence, many Indians feel that a
                foreign qualification is better than an Indian one. The
                derecognition of the Fellowship of the Royal College came
                about, if I remember correctly, as a knee-jerk reaction to the
                General Medical Council of the UK having withdrawn the
                recognition of Indian medical degrees. Of course the reaction
                of the Indian government had purely symbolic value, because
                many Indian doctors still yearn to possess this qualification,
                not least because it ensures better money in the Gulf
                countries, and is also helpful in private practice in this country.
                The policy-makers in the Medical Council of India should
                explain why Indian qualifications have not been able to
                inspire the same confidence as a foreign one.
