				<h4>National workshop on accreditation of private hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					<em>The Journal of the  Qualified Private Medical Practitioners' Association</em>, Kerala, carries a short  report of a national workshop organised by WHO, the government of India and the  Medical Council of India, to finalise the minimum standards for registration  and accreditation of private hospitals in the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need for regulation  of hospitals of all types was endorsed by the workshop, though it is necessary  to categorise hospitals according to services provided on location, with  separate guidelines. Every state shall have an assessment and accreditation council  authorised to draw up minimum standards to be adopted by all hospitals in each  state; to inspect and recommend to the government regarding accreditation, and  draw optional higher standards for grading of hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Proposals prepared  during an earlier workshop were discussed, and the position in each state was  described. The Medical Council of India was authorised to nominate a  sub-committee of doctors and legal experts to draft rules for the  implementation of minimum standards for private hospitals, to be submitted to  the central governemnt, which in turn may present this in the form of a bill at  the next parliamentary session. The WHO has offered technical and financial  assistance to develop packages for information, communication and training, as  well as funding some pilot projects.
