				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					Education in ethics is now a formal part of the undergraduate
					medical curriculum. However, most courses are structured around
					principles and case studies more appropriate to western countries.
					The cultures and practices of countries like India differ from those
					of western countries. It is, therefore, essential that our teaching
					should address the issues which are the most relevant to our
					setting. An anonymised, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional
					survey of medical students was carried out to get a picture of
					the ethical problems faced by students in India. The data were
					categorised into issues related to professional behaviour and
					ethical dilemmas. Unprofessional behaviour was among the
					issues reported as a matter of concern by a majority of the medical
					students. The survey highlights the need to design the curriculum
					in a way that reflects the structure of medical education in India,
					where patients are not always considered socio-culturally equal
					by students or the medical staff. This perspective must underpin
					any further efforts to address education in ethics in India.

				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					Preparing physicians-in-training to become independent
					decision-makers dedicated to the well-being of their patients
					is the focus of clinical education <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ginsburg S, Regehr G, Lingard L. The disavowed curriculum: understanding student's reasoning in professionally challenging situations. J Gen Intern Med. 2003 Dec;18(12):1015-22. " id="1">(1)</a>. Formal medical training
					often emphasises the acquisition of knowledge and skills.
					However, these achievements, while necessary, are not the only
					attributes of a good doctor <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Wallace AG. Educating tomorrow's doctors: the thing that really matters is that we care. Acad Med. 1997 Apr;72(4):253-8." id="2">(2)</a>. Traditionally, medical learning is
					based on an apprenticeship model, in which more experienced
					physicians provide mentoring and transmit essential
					knowledge, skills and attitudes relating to clinical practice by
					serving as role models for behaviour <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Farnsworth WE. Training physicians to be doctors-teachers and healers, problem-solvers and decision-makers. J Am Osteopath Assoc. 1991Oct;91(10):1005-18." id="3">(3)</a>. In recent years, there
					has been a growing conviction that medical education should
					include formal ethics curricula with the aim of inculcating the
					clinical and ethical decision-making skills and professional
					values, which good doctors need to possess <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Eckles RE, Meslin EM, Gaffney M, Helft PR.

The importance of including bio-medical ethics in the curriculum of health education institutes. Educ Health (Abingdon). 2004 Mar;17(1):93-6." id="6">6</a>). Many

					curricula for their students, and the Indian Council for Medical
					Research (ICMR) has introduced certificate courses in ethics,
					aimed mainly at faculty and researchers <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravindran GD. Medical ethics education in India. Indian J Med Ethics. 2008 Jan-Mar;5(1):18-19. " id="7">(7)</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Topics such as "Principles of medical ethics" and "History of
					ethics", though interesting, do not address the issues faced by
					students and physicians on a day-to-day basis. Furthermore,
					the curricula tend to be based on western literature and
					experiences. Studies have shown that effective education in
					medical ethics must be driven by the participants and should
					be specific to the stage of development <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goldie J, Schwartz L, Morrison J. A process evaluation of medical ethics education in the first year of a new medical curriculum. Med Educ. 2000 Jun;34(6):468-73." id="8">(8)</a>. India needs to
					develop curricula appropriate to the needs of the medical students in our cultural setting. A curriculum which addresses
					the different ethical issues faced by students in the various
					phases of their education is likely to be relevant and, therefore,
					more acceptable to Indian medical students.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this article, we report the results of a survey of the ethical
					issues faced by medical students during the clinical years of
					their MBBS training at a medical college in south India. At
					present, the students receive training in ethics through lectures,
					role plays and small group discussions during the foundation
					course, Community Orientation Programme (COP) and the first
					clinical year, during specific postings such as medicine and
					obstetrics, and during their internship. However, training in
					ethics is imparted in accordance with the needs of the relevant
					faculty and the ethics curriculum is not formally structured as
					a separate entity. This was among the activities undertaken to
					help redesign the curriculum.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Methods</h4>
				<p>
					<em>Design and setting:</em> The survey was conducted in 2012 at a
					medical college in south India that has an annual intake of 60
					students. A semi-structured, anonymous questionnaire was
					distributed to students in the four clinical years (Appendix 1).
					The questionnaire was developed after discussions with the
					faculty teaching undergraduate students. Since this was a
					preliminary survey, the scale was not validated, but there are
					plans to do so for future assessments. The questionnaire had
					eight questions with subdivisions. The basic demographic data
					on gender and year of college were collected. Questions on
					teaching and learning ethics were graded on a five-point Likert
					scale. Open-ended questions sought information on the ethical
					issues encountered by the students in the last year.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Participants:</em> Students from the four clinical years (n=242) were
					requested to participate. This survey was part of a series of
					larger surveys on the quality of our medical curriculum and was
					conducted to improve our present curriculum and teaching.
					It was not planned as a research study and was, therefore,
					not submitted to the Institutional Review Board for approval.
					Consent was obtained for the survey from the institutional
					administration, as well as for the publication of the anonymised
					results of the data analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Analysis:</em> The data were entered on Epidata and basic analysis
					was done with SPSS v15. The open-ended questions were
					analysed and coded into those causing distress/discomfort and
					those causing dilemmas, and further coded into those relating
					to professional behaviour and those relating to ethical issues.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>
					Of the 242 students contacted, 189 (78%) responded. Of the
					respondents, 38% were men and 60% women. Thus, women
					had a better response rate than men (Tables 1 and 2).
				</p>
				<p>
					Fifty-five per cent of the participants reported facing ethical
					issues during their student period. A total of 358 reported
					instances of coming up against ethical issues (Table 3), with
					70% of the final year students and 14% of the first clinical year
					students reporting one or more issues. A similar trend was
					noticed in the responses related to questions about whether
					the students had witnessed ethical issues in the past year -
					20% of the first clinical year students reported that they had,
					whereas the corresponding figures for pre-final and final year
					students were 60% and 44%, respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					Among the 358 reported ethical issues, a majority (297/358,
					83%) were issues that caused distress or discomfort to the
					student. The responses were categorised into those reflecting
					problems with professional behaviour and those involving
					ethical issues. In the former category (Table 4), a large number
					of responses pertained to the rudeness with which doctors
					spoke to patients. Other respondents mentioned inappropriate
					behaviour on the part of students in the presence of patients.
					This included talking in a language the patient did not
					understand, laughing when he/she did not share the joke and
					placing their knee on his/her bed, etc., all of which caused
					distress or discomfort to the patient. Two respondents reported
					facing a dilemma over the boundaries that should govern the
					relationship between the doctor and the patient's relatives. The
					students seemed to be clear on the issue of the boundaries to
					be maintained between patients and physicians, but not on the
					relationship between patients' relatives and physicians.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the issues related to medical ethics (Table 5), one issue
					that gave rise to distress and dilemmas among a majority
					of students concerned the ethical use of patients to learn
					medicine. The distress stemmed from the discomfort, including
					pain and the inability to sleep, faced by patients when
					examined by students. Inconvenience, too, was a cause of
					distress, as the students' participation in teaching clinics, etc,
					made them late for other appointments. The subjective feeling
					of 28 students was that the consent obtained from the patient
					was inadequate. The students also felt it was improbable that
					confidentiality and privacy were maintained during clinics.
					Twenty-six students were uncertain about the purpose and
					ethics of obtaining a sexual history from patients with medical
					conditions the diagnosis and further management of which
					may not strictly require a sexual history.
				</p>
				<p>
					Abortion and euthanasia were issues that caused a dilemma
					and required greater clarity. As expected, while issues relating
					to patient care, such as abortion, euthanasia and confidentiality,
					were brought up more often by students in the pre-final and
					final years, the first clinical year students more frequently
					reported issues relating to showing disrespect towards
					cadavers for dissection, copying records and cheating during
					examinations, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					The students reported that they had learnt and thought
					about ethics during other activities, such as those under the
					Community Orientation Programme (COP), the Community
					Health Programmes (CHP) and the Secondary Hospital
					Programme (SHP). In the COP, the students live in a village for
					three weeks, with access only to the facilities available in the
					village. This helps them understand the problems faced by
					the rural people, in terms of the social determinants of health.
					In the CHP, the students are given two weeks to plan and
					implement a health programme, and are exposed to issues
					such as healthcare rationing, prioritising among the different
					health needs of populations, when resources are limited and
					setting limits to care within budgetary constraints. In the SHP,
					the students visit and spend time in secondary hospitals across
					the country.
				</p>
				<p>
					Approximately 83% of the students agreed that ethics
					education is as important as clinical training. Interestingly,
					65% disagreed with the statement that doctors are inherently
					ethical and 60% disagreed with the statement that being
					religious makes for sufficient ethical training. Only 42% of the
					students agreed that ethics could be taught (Appendix 1).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Discussion</h4>
				<p>
					Medical education is a combination of didactic and practical
					training, in which students learn through exposure to the
					practice of clinical medicine, predominantly in a hospital
					setting associated with an academic institution. Every
					encounter in the medical care setting has an ethical dimension.
					In most situations in medical education, the art and science of
					ethics are implied rather than considered formally.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this survey, we identified that a subset of our medical
					students was uncomfortable with the professional behaviour
					of some of their teachers and colleagues. Some doctors
					and students were reported to have treated patients with
					disrespect, spoken rudely, shouted at them and made
					inappropriate jokes reflecting the sociocultural divide that
					exists between some patients and doctors/ doctors-in-training.
					These findings are similar to those of student surveys from
					other colleges <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Johnston C, Haughton P. Medical students' perceptions of their ethics teaching. J Med Ethics. 2007 Jul;33(7):418-22.
					" id="9">(9)</a>. This study did not specifically take into
					account the circumstances under which these issues were
					encountered - eg, whether doctors were working under highstress
					conditions due to large patient numbers, - but this is an
					area that can be explored in future studies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other findings related to issues common to all students.
					These included cheating or copying, reported by 5% of the
					students, marking proxy attendance (6%), and other issues
					specific to medical students at different stages of training.
					Complex ethical issues faced by the doctors, such as those
					related to transplants, assisted reproduction and experimental
					therapies, were encountered by the students less frequently.
					This suggests that issues concerning "everyday ethics", such
					as abortion and withdrawal of care, which the students
					face and consider, should form part of a new curriculum for
					undergraduate medical students, rather than more complex
					issues that they rarely encounter. A study by Goldie et al reported that students seem to value ethics curricula that are
					contextual rather than theoretical <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goldie J, Schwartz L, Morrison J. A process evaluation of medical ethics education in the first year of a new medical curriculum. Med Educ. 2000 Jun;34(6):468-73." id="8">(8)</a>.

				<p>
					A consideration of what should be taught begins with what is
					already being taught. There is substantial variation in the time
					allotted for and the quality of the medical bioethics curriculum.
					The need for more formal education in ethics has been
					recognised, but the concept of imparting education in medical
					ethics is fairly new and there is a dearth of funding. There is also
					a belief that ethics is best taught through role modelling rather
					than formal teaching <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paice E, Heard S, Moss F. How important are role models in making good doctors? BMJ. 2002 September 28;325(7366):707-10. " id="10">(10)</a>. Few colleges have a department
					of bioethics with a faculty that is trained in bioethics and
					dedicated to teaching medical students. Hardly any college
					is engaged in the development and evaluation of an ethics
					curriculum and staff. Very little effort has been expended
					in developing programmes for education in bioethics.
					Consequently, bioethics courses are often poorly developed
					and meagre in content, and contain mainly case studies and
					modules borrowed or adapted from western literature.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another barrier is that most institutions merely pay lip service
					to the cause of education in bioethics and their efforts lack in
					substance. Institutions with ethics programmes may only satisfy
					the minimum requirement of accrediting agencies and do not
					have adequate services to ensure ethical care of patients. The
					students were very clear about the need for training in ethics,
					in addition to clinical training. Since most medical education
					is imparted through practical teaching, the ethics curriculum
					should play a role in determining the format of all interactions
					with other professionals and patients, as well as treatment
					choices. Physicians who are mentors and teachers must
					indicate to students and trainees that ethics is a crucial part of
					what they are learning. In addition to the development of an
					"everyday ethics" teaching curriculum, two key complementary
					aspects must also be considered.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, a knowledge of the humanities and social sciences is of
					key importance in caring for patients as persons <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ousager J, Johannessen H. Humanities in undergraduate medical education: a literature review. Acad Med. 2010 Jun;85(6):988-98. doi: 10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181dd226b " id="11">(11)</a> Reading
					poetry or fiction that explores aspects of human illness and
					suffering gives a physician exposure to the human element
					of healthcare, which may be lost in the daily practice of
					technologically-driven medicine. Exposure to the humanities
					may thus enrich both the patient's and physician's experiences.
					Second, it is essential for students and physicians to understand
					law and the legal system <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Preston-Shoot M, McKimm J, Kong WM, Smith S. Readiness for legally literate medical practice? Student perceptions of their undergraduate medico-legal education. J Med Ethics. 2011 Oct;37(10):616-22. doi: 10.1136/jme.2010.041566. Epub 2011 May 16." id="12">(12)</a> A knowledge of the law has
					profound ethical implications when it comes to the care and
					well-being of patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most critical barriers to the provision of good-quality
					education in bioethics in India are the lack of commitment to
					developing an appropriate curriculum and financial constraints.
					Most institutions do not have separate budgets or dedicated
					support staff to run an ethics department. To develop an appropriate curriculum, specific strategies must be formulated
					to address ethical issues that are locally and universally
					important, using empirical data from India. Informing faculty
					members of the findings of surveys conducted among
					students could induce the former to teach students about the
					relevant problems more frequently. Other strategies might
					include encouraging faculty members to explicitly share their
					knowledge and experiences as a formalised teaching tool.
					Faculty or staff members could also be asked to keep a log
					of cases related to everyday ethics and share these with the
					"ethics faculty"', who, in turn, could teach students about these
					issues or discuss them in designated sessions. Finally, it would
					be useful to develop an model of teaching that helps teachers
					and trainers to address and balance the multiple concerns
					and agendas which arise in a complex and demanding field
					such as medicine. The findings of this study are limited by the
					small number of students covered and the fact that they are
					from a single medical college. Additionally, the questionnaire
					did not address the circumstances under which the reported
					ethical issues arose. The issues were reported in an openended
					section, and issues that were not perceived by the data
					collection team as being ethical issues were not taken up for
					further analysis.

					This survey is a part of the institution's effort to develop an
					ethics curriculum that would be best suited for its students. The
					findings will be used to develop and match the topics to be
					considered, and decide upon the training stage during which
					they are to be taught. We hope that aligning the teaching of
					ethics to the students' clinical postings will make the ethics
					curriculum more relevant and interesting. We plan to evaluate
					it after its introduction.

				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<p>
					Medical students face issues related to ethics and professional
					behaviour throughout their training, as is evident from their
					responses to the questionnaire. Several of the problems
					reported do not have a place in the traditionally structured
					modules on the teaching of ethics since they fall between the
					areas of ethics and professionalism. The survey shows that
					there is much to be desired as far as meeting the training
					needs of students is concerned, and similar surveys should be
					conducted with an eye to making the curriculum relevant to
					their needs in different phases of training.
