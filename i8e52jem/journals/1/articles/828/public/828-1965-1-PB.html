					Mental  disorders account for nearly 12.3% of the global disease burden, estimated to  increase to 15% by the year 2020 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Murray CJL, Lopez AD (eds). The global burden of disease: a comprehensive assessment of mortality and disability from diseases, injuries and risk factors in 1990 projected to 2020. Cambridge, MA: Havard School of Public Health on behalf of the World Health Organization and World Bank, 1996." id="1">(1)</a>. Much of this increase is likely to happen  in developing countries that are least prepared to deal with it. Due to paucity  of financial resources and the time taken to train professionals, developing  countries are unlikely to see substantial short-term increases in the number of  mental health professionals. Although effective interventions for many mental  disorders are available, only a minority receive treatment from mental health  services <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. The mental health context (Mental health policy and service guidance package). Geneva: World Health Organization, 2003." id="2">(2)</a>. The World Health Organization therefore recommends integration of  mental health services into primary health care as a strategy for increasing  access to mental health care <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="World Health Organization. Organisation of services for mental health (Mental health policy and service guidance package). Geneva: World Health Organization, 2003." id="3">(3)</a>. Training primary health care staff in mental  health care is both a challenge and an opportunity.

					<em>Where  there is no psychiatrist</em> attempts to address this training issue and is likely to be  of greatest use in the developing world. It draws inspiration from <em>Where there is no doctor</em> by David Werner and other books  of this genre. As the author says in the preface, there are no practical,  clinically oriented mental health care manuals designed for general health  workers. He correctly identifies the increasingly complex and technical  language of psychiatry as an important obstacle to improving access to mental  health care. This book attempts to break down the wall that psychiatry has  built around itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					The manual is divided into four parts. The first part provides an overview of  mental illness with guidelines for assessment and treatment. The second deals  with clinical problems using a problem-oriented approach as opposed to the  traditional diagnostic-based approach. The third provides guidance on  integrating mental health, including addressing the mental health needs of  vulnerable populations such as refugees and persons with HIV/AIDS, and guidance  on promotion and advocacy. The final part contains reference information for  common problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					This comprehensive manual uses illustrations and case studies liberally. It is  easy to understand and is interesting without being simplistic or too lengthy.  It covers the usual behavioural problems along with neglected topics such as  domestic violence, and sexual and psychological abuse. I was, however,  disappointed to see little coverage of psychotropic medications, which if used  appropriately, are a cost-effective intervention for many common mental  disorders. Primary-care clinicians are either unaware or wary of modern psychotropic  drugs and continue to prescribe older ones, which generally have more  side-effects that affect patient adherence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The presentation could be improved. Bulleted lists make it easier for the  reader to understand but several such lists actually worsen comprehension. I  would have liked to see some training lectures and presentations. Those  training primary-care staff would probably appreciate ready-made presentation  materials&mdash;an outline of a training programme, necessary slides and work  exercises.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  sheer comprehensiveness of the manual and the presentation format used may  leave the manual sitting on library shelves. That would be a shame because even  with all its shortcomings, the book is extremely well written and probably the  only such resource book on this subject. The review copy I received did not  mention the price. I hope that it is affordably priced for the average  primary-care worker in a developing country to own his/her own copy.
