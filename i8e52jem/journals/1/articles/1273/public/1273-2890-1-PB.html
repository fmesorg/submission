				<h4>C-sections save time</h4>
				<p>
					In 1997, Chile had the highest rate of Caesarean section
					in Latin America (40 per cent), though the procedure should
					not account for more than 15 per cent of births, according to
					the World Health Organisation. To look at the association
					between private health insurance and the high rate of Csections
					(women covered by the national health fund are
					much less likely to undergo C-sections) the authors
					conducted in-depth interviews with obstetricians and
					pregnant women and also analysed 540 interviews with
					women post-natally, and reviewed their medical notes.
					Private health insurance requires an obstetrician's care.
					"Conflicting demands arise from complex peripatetic work
					schedules and the need to provide personalised care for
					private patients. These are resolved by liberal use of
					caesarean section, which permits maximum efficiency in use
					of time. The prevailing business ethos in health care
					encourages such pragmatism among those doctors who do
					not have a moral objection to non-medical caesarean
					section."

				<h4>Morality in international research</h4>
				<p>
					In this contribution to the current international debate
					on the 'standard of care' for testing new interventions in
					medical research, the authors reject as simplistic the idea
					that this standard must mean the best proven treatment &mdash;
					this may be both unachievable and insufficient. The real
					question is: what are the researcher's moral responsibilities,
					given the context in which research is conducted? It is
					proposed that research must actively address the "social,
					political and economic forces that widen global inequities in
					health". This approach to research ethics gives less weight
					to international research guidelines, and more to the
					development of a 'broad moral agenda' which will come from
					recognising the potentially exploitative nature of research,
					and insight into economic policies which increase disparity
					and affect people's health. Among the requirements for
					"moral progress in international health research" are:
					ensuring that researchers understand the social, economic
					and political context in which they work; ensuring that trials
					are directly relevant to &mdash; and benefit &mdash; the researched
					country's needs, evaluating in advance whether the study
					finding can and will be incorporated into the local health
					system; and ensuring that the research does not deepen
					existing disparities.

				<h4>Gene research and India</h4>
				<p>
					What does the draft sequence of the human genome
					mean to India? This editorial describes the scientific
					milestones of this project, the different approaches of
					privately and publicly funded groups in the collaboration, and some implications in terms of possible drugs and
					diagnostics. In India, one area of research has been inherited
					diseases. "The vast diversity of India with its relatively
					reproductively isolated populations is a storehouse for
					studying the genetic determinants of biological response."
					Work is also ongoing in agriculture, parasite research, and
					so on. "India is scientifically well placed to benefit from the
					developments of the HGP, especially with the help of
					bioinformatics and the private sector. However, it remains to
					be seen how much of this capability will be harvested in a
					way that benefits society."

				<h4>When a hysterectomy is warranted</h4>
				<p>
					Hysterectomy is too often seen as the only answer to
					a variety of gynaecological problems, despite improvements
					in imaging, and the existence of other surgical and medical
					alternatives. This article describes the procedure's risks in
					terms of mortality and morbidity, its limited indications,
					conservative alternatives, and when it is not warranted. "As
					hysterectomy carries significant risks and can have a
					markedly negative impact on quality of life, the patient must
					be given the most complete and objective information
					possible, and her preferences must be taken into account in
					the therapeutic decision."

				<h4>Lessons from the Iceland database</h4>
				<p>
					The rich genetic variation in Indian society suggests
					that there is great scope for genetic research in this country.
					While some of this research could benefit the local
					community, the commercial possibilities of such work will
					bring for-profit companies into the picture. In 1998, the
					government of Iceland signed an agreement with a private
					company, deCODE, giving the company permission to use
					the medical records of this population valued for its
					genetic homogeneity. The project has been opposed on the
					grounds that it has not been debated publicly, that it denies
					access to academic researchers, that measures to protect
					privacy are inadequate, and individual discretion to opt out
					is an inadequate substitute for individual consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the agreement relates to the use of medical records,
					DeCODE's primary purpose is to collect and analyse DNA
					samples for commercial purposes, and the author discusses
					issues related to genetic research in detail. Some points:
					medical-records research is different from DNA-based
					research, community consent is needed but may not be a
					sufficient ethical requirement, and international standards
					for consent to research should apply to genetic research.
