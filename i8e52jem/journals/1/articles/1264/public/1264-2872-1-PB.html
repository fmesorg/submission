				<h4>Innocent till proven
				guilty</h4>
				<p>
					Dr. Arun Bal in his editorial has made a few fundamental blunders Income tax raids and unaccounted wealth do not contravene criminal laws. At most they constitute breach of civil laws.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India the judiciary maintains that a person is assumed to be innocent till proven guilty. Till the president of the Medical Council of India is convicted of his crimes, it is unjust to launch a frontal attack on him.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I agree that medical councils have failed utterly in their regulatory function, so have the government bodies and the public at large.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only saving grace as far as the regulation of medical practice &mdash; or match fixing &mdash; is the judiciary and I suppose that consumer protection can never be replaced by any medical council, however credible it may be. After all the credibility of a police enquiry is far less than that of a judicial inquiry where crimes related to police excesses are concerned. The portrayal of modern medicine as techno-savvy and yearning for the old human touch seems to be the passionate theme of modern writers on medical ethics. I wish to maintain that both are not mutually exclusive.
				</p>
				<p>
					A practitioner of complex modern medicine with all its and technological complexities can be humane and considerate
				</p>
				<p>
					This also does not mean that the human and considerate doctor of yesteryears could not be utterly incompetent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Later then Buddha said, there has to be a middle path, a fusion of gently humanness and tough scientific rigour to give the best to our patients.
