					<strong>Don't single out private colleges</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Itake strong exception to  your statement in the editorial <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bal Arun: A doctor's murder. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 39." id="1">(1)</a>. You have written, "As medical  education became commercialised, the alliance between corrupt medical council  members and politician owners of capitation fee-based private medical colleges destroyed  the profession's ethical fabric."
				</p>
				<p>
					This sort of  generalisation and lumping of all private medical colleges under one wide  umbrella is distasteful. While I accept that many private colleges have a lot  of scope for improvement and leave a lot to be desired, there are other private  colleges who are making genuine efforts to maintain standards, and it is not  fair to tar them with the same brush. And what about government colleges? Are  they above corrupt practices?
				</p>
				<p>
					To me, the decline of  self-regulation started a long time ago, in the fair city of Mumbai, where the  cut-practice racket started, spreading to other cities and towns. The decline  started when specialists began treating patients according to the dictates of  the referring general practitioner. It continued when unnecessary admissions  and operations began to be done because "If I don't do it someone else will."  With so much turmoil within us it is not fair to single out private colleges  for censure.
				</p>
				<p>
					Having been a  surgeon, a teacher and having spent some time on the State Medical Council as a  university representative, I have seen how ineffective our internal policing is.
				</p>
				<p>
					The practice of  medicine is no longer a profession but a commercial venture, with most  practitioners, either singly or in groups, investing in costly  diagnostic/therapeutic equipment and trying to recoup the investment by fair  means or foul.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 'because it is  there' syndrome is a major ailment affecting our profession. Remove the  appendix because it is there. The USG shows a simple ovarian cyst, take it out.  CT/MRI facilities are available, use them to impress the patient. Who is  bothered about medical justification and patient safety?
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many more  problems which have to be faced and rooted out. Unless like-minded people get  together and form a strong and effective lobby the trend will not change. It is  encouraging to see some new entrants into the profession, who want to practise  ethically. Maybe it is up to them to cleanse the profession and bring back the  dignity and prestige that was once associated with the words 'medical doctor'.
