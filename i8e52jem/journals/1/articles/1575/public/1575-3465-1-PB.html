				<h4>Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					In 1903 the Wright  brothers flew for the first time in a machine heavier than air. They soared 30  metres above land for 12 seconds. No one would have imagined that this  technology would one day lead to the manufacture of aircraft which would cross  the sound barrier and transport hundreds of people across the world. Today,  another earthshattering scientific achievement has been made which will  revolutionise biotechnology: man has been able to clone a mammal from an adult  cell in the laboratory. In addition, it is now possible to replace or introduce  new genes into a cell in the progress of an individual. This has been possible  because of the tremendous progress made in molecular and cellular biology and  our ability to study the genetic material - DNA - more closely.

				<h4>Recombinant DNA technology</h4>
				<p>
					DNA is a long, double  stranded chain of nucleotides on which are located functional units called  genes. The discovery of enzymes called restriction endonucleases has provided a  powerful tool to cut DNA into smaller fragments at specific sites and join them  with any other DNA fragment cut with the same enzyme, thus making recombinant  DNA molecules. A major change in biotechnology came about along with this  discovery when the molecular biology of microbes was unraveled. Bacteria carry  plasmids which are autonomous, extra- chromosomal DNA molecules in the microbes  which can be purified in the laboratory. Genes (DNA) from any organism can be  introduced into bacteria via plasmids and expressed in a simple, inexpensive  bacterial system. Human genes can now be joined to regulatory DNA sequences of  bacterial genes and expressed in bacteria. A number of pharmaceutical companies  are producing substances such as insulin by using this technology instead of  from animal or human tissues. Such proteins are called recombinant proteins.

				<p>
					During  the last two decades techniques in molecular biology have added immensely to  our knowledge of the molecular make- up of the cell. It is not only conceivable  to identify any gene from our 50,000 to 100,000 genes which we carry in every  cell, but it is possible to isolate a specific gene from a few blood cells  drawn from our body. With the help of this technology it is feasible to clone  the isolated gene and grow it on a large scale, analyse it by sequencing its  nucleotides and express it either in bacteria or in mammalian cells in culture  to produce large quantities of the protein.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  function of a gene can be elucidated by studying the protein it makes.  Mutations in certain genes result in defective protein synthesis, thus  resulting in a diseased condition. With the help of molecular biology  techniques it is possible to diagnose some of the diseases by molecular  analysis of the patient's DNA. Diagnosis of some of the diseases including  genetic disorders, cancer and infections has become swift and sensitive using  this modern technology. Individuals at an increased risk for a particular  disease can be diagnosed at a very early stage in life. Prophylactic treatment  can be given to some such individuals.

				<h4>Gene transfer in mammals in vivo</h4>
				<p>
					In addition to expressing  foreign genes in bacteria and mammalian cells in culture, genes can be  expressed in whole animals by transgenic technology. Genes, in the form of  purified DNA carrying appropriate regulatory sequences, can be introduced into  fertilised eggs before they start dividing. These manipulated eggs are then  reintroduced into the uterus of recipient, foster females and allowed to  develop to term. The young ones born from the foster mother are then screened  for the presence of the transgene. Transgene animals carry the transgene in all  their cells including germ line cells. They can be bred to obtain a colony of  genetically modified animals, since the transgene can be passed on to the  progeny. This has limitless applications in animal husbandry and farming, medicine,  production of recombinant proteins from animals and in basic research. Many  different species have been considered for the production of medicinal products  and transgenes have been expressed in body fluids such as blood or milk as well  as other tissues. The pharmaceutical industry worldwide has recognised the  potential benefits of using transgenic technology in production of  pharmaceutical material as well as in the understanding of human diseases and  exploring newer therapies.

				<h4>Gene transfer in humans</h4>
				<p>
					The next obvious step  was to introduce foreign genes into human cells in viva. A large number of  genetic diseases are caused by the presence of a single defective gene. It has  been the dream of mankind to correct single gene defects by replacing them by normal  genes. This dream has now come true with the help of recombinant DNA  technology. Gene therapy, where genetic material or DNA is used in therapy, has  become a. reality. At present gene transfer in viva in human somatic cells is  permitted after obtaining clearance from regulatory bodies. Germ- line gene  transfer into humans has yet to be approved.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  first clinical trial for human somatic cell gene therapy was carried out in  1990 by a group of scientists and clinicians in the USA for a disease called severe  combined immuno- deficiency syndrome (SCID). Two young girls, suffering from  SCID due to defect in their gene coding for an enzyme, adenosine deaminase,  received the normal gene thereby overcoming the enzyme deficiency. Today there  are a large number of ongoing clinical trials in the West for genetic diseases  as well as cancer. Clinical trials are carried out on a select group of  patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the gene therapy strategy. We  learn and improve on existing strategies from these clinical trials. We still  have a long way to go before gene therapy becomes a routine practice but there  is optimism that it will.

				<h4>Ethical issues in using recombinant DNA  technology in medicine</h4>
				<p>
					As mentioned earlier,  advances in molecular biology have made diagnosis of some of the diseases very  sensitive, accurate and rapid. Diagnosis of genetic disorders associated with  chromosomal alterations often helps in deciding the course of treatment for the  patient. However, these tests are expensive as they involve costly molecular  biology reagents and should be recommended only if it is absolutely essential  for patient management and care. Unfortunately, very often, a plethora of tests  is recommended only to recover the cost of the expensive equipment purchased to  carry out the test. Is this ethical?
				</p>
				<p>
					With  the discovery of genes involved in the etiology of various diseases it is now  possible to identify those which confer susceptibility to the disease.  Individuals carrying the susceptibility gene may be at a higher risk of  contracting the disease. On learning that a person is carrying the  susceptibility gene, can one stop or prevent progression of the disease?  Prophylactic treatment can be given to some such individuals. Environmental  factors which trigger the disease could be avoided. Could the knowledge that  one is carrying the susceptibility gene lead to more problems than benefits?  Will it lead to discrimination in employment, insurance policies, social life?  Very often when screening families with familial cancers for susceptibility  genes, it is difficult to convince unaffected, young, unmarried females to  provide a sample of blood for genetic analysis. They fear that if they were  found to carry susceptibility gene/s they would be stigmatised. Such information  therefore has to be kept strictly confidential. Informed consent has to be  obtained from the participants after explaining the risks and benefits of the  research or treatment.

				<h4>Ethical issues in somatic and germline gene  therapy in humans</h4>
				<p>
					Somatic cell gene  therapy is only a small step forward as the DNA is not passed on to the  offspring. The only problem that one envisages from somatic gene therapy for  genetic disorders is that this may significantly enhance the proportion of  abnormal genes in the population. Individuals with defective genes will be able  to survive, reach maturity and pass these genes to their offspring. This can be  avoided by introducing the therapeutic DNA into the germline cells. Such  genetic manipulations would offer considerable hope to individuals with genetic  disorders. However, the technology for germline gene transfer in humans needs  to be improved to be sure that abnormal foetuses are not formed due to the  manipulations. But the major question is - is it ethical? Are we justified in  changing the genetic make- up of a human being? One may argue that it should be  permissible to rectify a genetic defect. But would it lead to selecting 'good'  genes for physical appearance, intelligence etc? Will there be another Hitler  who will try to change the human race with these powerful tools in hand?

					Cloning  of a sheep from an adult cell, closely followed by cloning of a monkey, has  caused quite a furor worldwide. This technological feat has a tremendous  potential in our understanding o'f genetics and reproduction, in improving the  process of breeding where farm animals are considered. Whether this would lead  to man making numerous copies of himself/ herself; whether this abnormal way of  reproduction should be permitted, are some ethical, moral and spiritual  questions.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The recent advances in  biotechnology present both benefits and risks. They have revolutionised the  process of drug manufacture, diagnosis and treatment and the production of  animal models for human diseases. There is a tremendous potential for creating  new drugs and treatment. This technology raises important ethical issues in the  social structures including families, preventive medicine, employment, health  insurance etc. We must interact with the general public, to educate them, and  prepare them better for the impact of biotechnology. The scientific and medical  communities and the public, in general, have to use these powerful tools  responsibly, for the maximum benefit of mankind.

				<h4>Where the mind is without fear</h4>
				<p>
					Where the mind is  without fear and the head is held high;
					<br />
					Where knowledge is free;
					<br />
					Where the world has not  been broken up into fragments
					<br />
					by narrow domestic  walls;
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the words come out  from the depth of truth;
					<br />
					Where tireless striving  stretches its arms toward perfection;
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the clean stream  of reason has not lost its way
					<br />
					into the dreary desert  sand of dead habit;
					<br />
					Where the mind is led  forward by Thee
					<br />
					into ever widening  thought and action
					<br />
					Into  that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
