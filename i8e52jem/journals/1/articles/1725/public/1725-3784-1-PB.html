					There is an outcry  against the commercialisation, rampant profiteering and exploitation in  hospitals by doctors and others in the medical profession under the weight of  which it has become almost impossible for the poor, middle class and the white  collar fraternity in the country in general, particularly in Bombay and Delhi,  to get medical assistance and relief within their means.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once a patient enters a  hospital for medical aid and treatment, he is treated as a guinea- pig and  without knowing why, he is pushed on to several diagnostic and research  machines and is made to pay fancy fees and charges which, in many cases, breaks  the back of the patient and his relatives.
				</p>
				<p>
					The fees of the  specialists for visiting a patient at his house are fantastic. Large hospitals  have become 5- star hotels and patients are fleeced in several ways. No wonder  the people have realised that it is cheaper to die at home than to pay hospital  bills and the highly exhorbitant fees of the doctors.
				</p>
				<p>
					The need for a forum to  save the patients from these excesses of the medical profession and to make  efforts to secure the provision of cheap medical and hospitalisation services  for the common man continues to be voiced from several quarters. Patients and  their relatives are afraid to agitate against these malpractices apprehending  vindictiveness on the part of doctors and hospitals when they need help.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is in this context  that genuinely motivated and dedicated social organisations like the Medico-  Friends Circle,
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical and Hospital  Users' Welfare Association and Forum for Medical Ethics have to take leading  parts in alleviating the suffering of patients-
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						to check medical  malpractices in various forms by doctors and hospitals;
					</li>
					<li>
						to help and guide the  unfortunate victims - patients and their relatives - to seek QUICK and FAIR  redressal at the district and national Consumer Redressal Forums under the  Consumer Protection Act 1986 for legitimate compensation and financial relief.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Indictments and censure  by the Indian Medical Council, state medical councils, other governmental  organisations
				</p>
				<p>
					or the FDA have been few  and leave the doctors unfazed. The doctor- patient relationship has become very  bitter and controversial over the last few years. The introduction of the Act  to cover the medical profession and give protection to the consumers or  patients has come as a rude shock to the medical fraternity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Consumers'  Protection Act would cleanse the medical profession and truly make it a noble  calling in the service of humanity.

					(Editor's note: Similar  sentiments are often to be found in the correspondence columns of our dailies.  These do no credit to our profession. It is in our own interest that we root  out practices that bring us disrepute.
				</p>
				<p>
					Failure to do so will  only further worsen the relationship so vital to success in our work - that  between the patient and the doctor.)
