				<h4>Doctor-doctor ethics</h4>
				<p>
					In reference to your article on the ethical relationship between doctors <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chinoy, RF: Medical ethics: relationship between doctor and patient. Issues in Medical Ethics, 1997; 5: 105-109." id="1">(1)</a>, I would like to make some comments: Regarding the professional services physicians provide to each other, the fact is that when a doctor approaches a specialist for himself or his family, the specialist assumes he must treat his colleague free of charge or at a reduced charge. Either incorrect or standard treatment is given as a result. The fees may be recovered indirectly (or through the hospital's 'cut') by ordering unnecessary hospitalisation, even in the ICCU, or other procedures. Perhaps physicians would be wise to conceal their professional identity when seeking medical services.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regarding the ethical question of the 'duty of a physician to the .profession-at large to expose incompetent, corrupt, dishonest, unethical conduct on the part of members of the profession-without fear or favour as these are against the best interests of the patient,' how many of us have done anything towards this goal either singly or collectively, through medical associations, through <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>, a medical journal, or any other means?
				</p>
				<p>
					The medical councils are meant to do exactly this, in the case of all doctors registered with them. Instead, members of these medical councils shield doctors against accusations of obvious medical negligence. Decisions are taken, and cases are closed unilaterally, without conducting a proper enquiry or giving the complainant an opportunity to present the matters personally before the council.
				</p>
				<p>
					Specialists play with the lives of unsuspecting patients by admitting them into hospitals where the registered medical officer is not an allopath, a situation created by hospitals mainly to save a few thousand rupees for the services of qualified doctors. Physicians issue false affidavits to shield their colleagues even in cases of deaths caused by clear-cut medical negligence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients witness 'non-ethics' at all levels of the medical profession. When a doctor becomes a patient there exists no relationship between doctors.
