				<h4>Ethics and medical  students</h4>
				<p>
					Starting an ethical discussion proves to be a difficult task. At the University  of Utrecht, Netherlands, students are introduced to medical ethics during the  second year of medical studies. The objectives of this course are to define  moral problems, to formulate precise arguments and to analyse these arguments.
				</p>
				<p>
					The introductory course consists of three work group sessions and  four lectures. As a student instructor at these sessions I wish to discuss, in  this essay, some common difficulties encountered at the start of a discussion.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to extract a clear view from a variety of opinions. I am  forced to generalise this summary.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h5>Responsibility</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						When posed with a moral dilemma students tend to withdraw. They basically don't  feel responsible to deal with this problem. Moreover, some students think their  task is only restricted to the medical treatment, so they won't respond. Other  students will say: "I am a doctor and it's my duty to treat patients but  not to argue with them." In the work group sessions the students are shown  their responsibility and are motivated to face it. A distinction is made  between pure professional responsibility which covers your knowledge of the  medical skill, and moral responsibility, which is related to your own personal  view, in which the physician is 'equal' to the patient. Students are challenged  to act the actual doctor and to formulate decisions without fear or favour.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Relativism</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						In any discussion the  diversity of opinions is evident. Mostly there is strong opposition between  deontological and utilitarian argumentation. At an almost predictable point  some students respond by saying: "It's no use discussing this matter, for  we will never agree," thereby actually killing the discussion, or (another  sledge-hammer argument): "I don't mind that he doesn't agree, he may say  so." This relativistic approach to moral pluralism is opposed in the  sessions by emphasising certain aspects of the dilemma which they can't  possibly tolerate. In addition, students are encouraged to convince each other  of their own opinion. Motivating proves to be a powerful drug, though it  unfortunately doesn't always succeed.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Authorities</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						In argumentation, students tend to refer to authorities such as lawyers and  doctors. For example. "In the Netherlands abortion is accepted by law (if  several conditions are met), this makes it morally correct to abort a  child." Or: "In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is a common treatment in  medical practice so it's ethically correct." However, authorities can be  ignored by posing a counter example like: "Slavery has also been a  practice but do you approve of this?" Physicians and lawyers, students are  taught, may be authorities in the social context, but from the moral point of  view they are all equal to other people, they only express their personal  views.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Abstraction</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Often students try to  escape a moral decision by claiming lack of information. Throughout medical  studies, students are taught to approach a dilemma scientifically. A general  difference between a moral debate and scientific debate is that a scientific  debate is ruled by facts, whereas a moral debate is ruled by arguments.  Therefore a moral dilemma requires a different approach. It's difficult for  them to argue on abstract information. The problem of abstraction is very  instructive. If you ask students which information they lack, they mostly  answer medical information. They ask for precise percentages of success of  medical treatment, the risks etc. But when offered exact information such as,  for example, "The rate of success is 30% and the risk of operation is lung  emboli," they still don't know what to do. This is a very essential point.  Students are clearly shown that a practical situation does not clarify an  ethical problem. Moreover, practice often troubles the doctor's vision. Doctors  may think they decide on medical grounds but actually it is a moral decision.
					</p>
					<li>
						<h5>Misconceptions</h5>
					</li>
					<p>
						Students usually think ethics have to do with some imperatives stating right  from wrong. Therefore they often give answers which, they think, are ethically  correct rather than their own opinion. Throughout the course misconceptions  about ethics are removed. In a debate students are reminded that they have to  express their personal view and they shouldn't adhere to standards or rules.

				<h4>Reluctance to exercise  moral faculties</h4>
				<p>
					All these factors have, more or less, one thing in common, which one could call  a flight reaction. Moral dilemmas are difficult personal dilemmas.  Participation requires some courage for no one likes to take a vulnerable position  by expressing one's personal views. This may be a common psychological  phenomenon. In spite of the fact that these factors may paralyse the discussion  and create a blockade in the student by alleviating these difficulties, they  may create important learning points. I hope I've demonstrated sufficiently  that even in a society as liberal as the Dutch, education on medical ethics is  an essential element of medical education. In defending ethical standards of  the medical profession one can not solely trust the conscience of the  physician. This physician must be challenged as well, to defend his or her  decision. I refer to the twofold interpretation of the principle of respect for  autonomy: a decision must not only be respected but challenged too. A moral  attitude is often thought to be an inborn consciousness which some people have  and other people have not. I do not agree. Communication is, in my belief, the  basis for the development of your moral attitude. Discussion broadens and, even  more, sharpens your personal opinion. One could ask: "Why do you need  education for this attitude?" My answer is because of the flight reaction  I experienced. In the sessions I observed that students tend to tolerate all  too soon each other's arguments, just because they don't want to offend each  other. Moreover in my opinion it's very essential that in the preparation for  the medical profession, students are taught to acknowledge both their  professional and moral responsibility.

				<h4>The art of medicine...</h4>
				<p>
					The practice of medicine combines both science and art. The role  of science in medicine is clear. Technology based on science is the foundation  for the solution to many problems; the dazzling advances in biochemical  methodology and in biophysical imaging techniques that allow us access to the  remotest recesses of the body are the products of science. So too are the  therapeutic manoeuvres which increasingly are a major part of medical practice.  Yet skill in the most sophisticated application of laboratory technology or the  use of the latest therapeutic modality alone does not make one a good  physician. This ability to extract from a mass of contradictory physical signs  and from the crowded computer printouts of laboratory data those items which  are of crucial significance, to know in a difficult case whether to 'treat' or  to 'watch', to determine when a clinical clue is worth pursuing or when to  dismiss it as a 'red herring', and to estimate in any given patient whether a  proposed treatment entails a greater risk than the disease are all involved in  the decisions which the clinician, skilled in the practice of medicine, must  make many times each day. This combination of medical knowledge, intuition, and  judgement is the art of medicine. It is as necessary to the practice of  medicine as is a sound scientific base.
				</p>
				<h4>To be a physician...</h4>
				<p>
					No greater opportunity, responsibility, or obligation can fall to  the lot of a human being than to become a physician. In the care of the  suffering he needs technical skill, scientific knowledge, and human  understanding. He who uses these with courage, with humility, and with wisdom  will provide a unique service for his fellow man, and will build an enduring  edifice of character within himself. The physician should ask of his destiny no  more than this; he should be content with no less.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tact, sympathy and understanding are expected of the physician,  for the patient is no mere collection of symptoms, signs, disordered functions,  damaged organs, and disturbed emotions. He is human, fearful, and hopeful,  seeking relief, help and reassurance. To the physician, as to the anthropologist,  nothing human is strange or repulsive. The misanthrope may become a smart  diagnostician of organic disease, but he can scarcely hope to succeed as a  physician. The true physician has a Shakespearean breadth of interest in the  wise and the foolish, the proud and the humble, the stoic hero and the whining  rogue. He cares for people.
