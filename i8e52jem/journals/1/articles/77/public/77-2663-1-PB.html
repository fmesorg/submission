				<h4>Abstract</h4>
				<p>
					The author conducted a voluntary Medical Humanities (MH) module  at Pokhara, Nepal, in 2007 as a curriculum innovation project for a  fellowship in health sciences education. He conducted a module for  faculty members at KIST Medical College (KISTMC), Lalitpur, Nepal, in  2008. The modules used literature excerpts, case scenarios, role-plays,  paintings and group activities to explore different aspects of MH. The  module for faculty members had the objectives of introducing faculty to  MH and also creating facilitators for the student modules. For the last  four years the author has been facilitating an MH module for first-year  medical students at KISTMC.
				</p>
				<p>
					The activity-based modules were conducted in small groups.  Participant views about the modules were positive. MH has a number of  benefits in medical education and should be strongly considered for  inclusion by medical schools in developing countries. MH modules should  be creative, fun and taken forward by interested faculty members.

				<h4>What are the medical humanities?</h4>
				<p>
					The medical humanities (MH) have been defined as 'an  interdisciplinary, and increasingly international endeavor that draws on  the creative and intellectual strengths of diverse disciplines,  including literature, art, creative writing, drama, film, music,  philosophy, ethical decision making, anthropology and history in pursuit  of medical educational goals' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kirklin D. The Centre for Medical Humanities, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, England. Acad Med. 2003;78:1048-53" id="1">(1)</a>. In MH, subjects traditionally known  as the humanities are used for medical educational purposes. Many  reviews have highlighted the importance and usefulness of MH in medical  education <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Macnaughton J.

				<h4>A voluntary MH module at Pokhara</h4>
				<p>
					In early January 2007, I was selected for a two-year, part-time  fellowship in health professions education and educational leadership at  the PSG-FAIMER (PSG Foundation for Advancement of International Medical  Education and Research) Regional Institute in Coimbatore, India, while  working as a faculty member at Manipal College of Medical Sciences  (MCOMS), Pokhara, Nepal. As part of the application process, candidates  have to submit the outline of a curriculum innovation project (CIP) to  be carried out at their home institution. I have a keen interest in  creative writing and photography and thought of using these interests to  develop an MH module as my CIP. The module was further refined during  the first on-site session at PSG-FAIMER in April 2007 <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR.

				<h4>Module for faculty members at KISTMC:</h4>
				<p>
					I joined KIST Medical College (KISTMC), a new medical school in  November 2007 and explored the possibility of conducting an MH module at  the institution. Dr Piryani, a faculty member in the department of  Medicine, was interested in being a co-facilitator and we conducted a  module for faculty members during March-August 2008 <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM, Karki BMS. A medical humanities module for faculty members at KIST Medical College, Imadol, Lalitpur [Internet]. J Clin Diagn Res 2011 Nov[cited 2012 Dec 30](Suppl 2);5(7):1489-92.

Literature  excerpts, paintings, case scenarios, small group work and role-plays  were used. The sessions covered were <em>Empathy, The patient, The  family, The caregiver, The doctor-patient relationship, Breaking bad  news and euthanasia, Obtaining informed consent, Abortion, Patient  participation in clinical research, Dealing with the HIV-positive  patient, Dealing with the mentally ill, and Women and medicine.</em> Participant feedback about the module was positive but certain problems were noted <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM, Karki BMS.

				<h4>Challenges faced during the first two modules</h4>
				<p>
					The major challenge faced during the inaugural module at MCOMS was  creating and sustaining participant interest and involvement <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR. Creating and maintaining participant interest in the medical humanities. 2009 Oct 28 [cited 2013 Jan 9]. In: Literature, arts and medicine blog [Internet]. New York: University of New York. C2007-2010. [about 5 screens]. Available from: http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/blog/?p=215" id="7">(7)</a>. Students sometimes found it difficult to participate due to the pressure  of other subjects and assessments. The module was held in the evening  and social and other activities occasionally prevented participation. A  group of 10 sixth semester students started participating regularly in  the module and their interest and enthusiasm played an important role in  driving the module forward. There were students of different  nationalities and the language of the module was English. The literature  excerpts used were in English and participants felt certain excerpts  were difficult to understand <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM. English as the language of medical humanities learning in Nepal: Our experiences. 2009 Apr 22 [cited 2013 Jan9]. In: Literature, arts and medicine blog [Internet]. New York: University of New York.c2007-2010. [about 3 screens]. Available from: http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/blog/?p=175" id="8">(8)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The participants in the faculty module at KISTMC had problems with  discussing sexual and reproductive issues openly. They had problems  with the level of English used in certain literature excerpts and were  reluctant to enact particular role-plays.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Module for first-year medical students at KISTMC:</h4>
				<p>
					KISTMC emphasises excellence in education, healthcare and research  and the principal and the Director (Academics) were keen to have an MH  module for all first year students <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM, Thapa TP, Karki BMS. Our experiences with 'Sparshanam', a medical humanities module for medical students at KIST Medical College, Nepal. J Clin Diagn Res.2010:4:2158-62." id="9">(9)</a>.Students are posted in the  hospital for early clinical exposure once a week and we (Dr Piryani and  I) decided to conduct the module during this period. Six teachers who  had attended the faculty module were selected as co-facilitators for the  student module. Participants had problems with literature excerpts  during the first two modules (at MCOMS and the faculty module) and we  decided not to use these during the student module <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM. Four years of medical humanities in Nepal: What worked and what did not. 2010 Sept12 [cited 2013 Jan 9]. In: Literature, arts and medicine blog [Internet]. New York: University of New York.c2007-2010[about 5 screens]. Available from: http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/blog/?p=854" id="10">(10)</a>. Small group  activities, case scenarios and role-plays, and the flexibility afforded  by the use of flip charts and flip boards were the strengths of the  sessions and we continued these during the student module.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first task was preparing an outline of topics to be covered in  the module. Among the topics stressed was empathy, the doctor, the  patient, the doctor-patient relationship, the caregiver, the family,  dealing with HIV-positive patients, the medical student and what it  means to be sick in Nepal. The module was held in the college  auditorium, a room which could be arranged according to session  requirements. The students were divided into six small groups and an LCD  projector, flip charts, flip boards and microphones were made  available. A place for conducting role-plays was also created. The  scenarios were created by the author in consultation with other  facilitators after a lot of thought and debate and reflected the  socio-cultural milieu of Nepal. Some of these scenarios have been  described elsewhere <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR. Using case scenarios and role plays to explore issues of human sexuality. Educ Health. 2008 Dec;21 (3):108." id="11">(11)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the next academic year (2009-2010), we had 100 students. This  created a different set of challenges. The major problem was how to  divide 100 students into six small groups. Students were divided into  two batches of 50 students each. Each batch was then subdivided into six  small groups. Sessions were conducted on alternate Thursdays for a  particular batch. Each topic was subdivided into two sections and the  number of topics was reduced. The author's experiences with three years  of MH has been discussed in a recent article where the topics covered  during the modules conducted in 2008, 2009 and 2010 are listed <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM. Three years of medical humanities at a new Nepalese medical school. Educ Health. 2011 Apr;24(1):535." id="12">(12)</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The module uses facilitator presentations, facilitator inputs,  audience elicitation sessions, interpretation of paintings, case  scenarios, group work and other activities to explore different aspects  of MH. The paintings used during the module and their annotations are  mainly obtained from the literature, arts and medicine database <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Literature, arts and medicine database [Internet]. New York: University of New York. 1993-What's new?; [cited 2013 Jan 9]; [about 2 screens]. Available from: http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Main?action=new" id="13">(13)</a>. Recently we have also used some paintings and sketches by our students.  Detailed participant feedback about the paintings used in the module has  been recently obtained <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shankar PR, Piryani RM, Upadhyay-Dhungel K. Student feedback on the use of paintings in Sparshanam, the medical humanities module at KIST Medical College, Nepal. BMC Med Educ. 2011;11:9." id="14">(14)</a>. Paintings were better able to bridge the  cultural and social divide compared to literature.

				<h4>How students perceive the module</h4>
				<p>
					Informal feedback about the module is obtained during discussion  with students. Detailed written feedback is also obtained at the end of  each session. Feedback is again obtained at the conclusion of the  module. Students' perception about the module is positive. The module is  not assessed and is not a 'formal' part of the curriculum. Student  attendance is good and is about 75 % to 80% even on days preceding  internal examinations. Students feel the module offers a different  perspective, is entertaining and 'fun', and will be useful in their  future practice. They also feel proud that KISTMC is one of the few  institutions conducting an MH module in Nepal and South Asia.

				<h4>My own evaluation of the modules</h4>
				<p>
					I have now been conducting MH modules for over six years. When I  first started the voluntary module at MCOMS I did not think I would be  able to sustain MH for long, and contribute to the development of the  discipline in Nepal and even other countries. At KISTMC I feel the  module has progressed well. The basic framework of the module is now  well defined. Its strength is its activity-based nature conducted in  small groups. Students enjoy participating in the module and learn while  enjoying themselves. The sessions are lively and a variety of issues  are explored.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Possible future directions of the module</h4>
				<p>
					Recently three "young" faculty members joined the module as  co-facilitators and now actively contribute to its design and  implementation. The basic framework of the module should, I feel remain  the same in the future. The module may change depending on consensus  among the young facilitators and their vision of MH and may become more  "localised" in the sense that more art and paintings and literature  excerpts from Nepal may be included. The module will remain  activity-based and be conducted in small groups using team-based  learning principles.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Advice for other medical schools considering an MH programme</h4>
				<p>
					In the present scenario MH remains largely confined to medical  schools in the West. In Asia, the discipline is only now beginning to  generate interest. In South Asia isolated programmes have been conducted  in medical schools. In New Delhi, India, regular lectures on topics  related to MH are conducted <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gupta R, Singh S, Kotru M. Reaching people through medical humanities: an initiative. J Educ Eval Health Prof. 2011;8:5." id="15">(15)</a>. The major challenge according to me is  that MH is regarded as yet another "subject" in an already overloaded  medical curriculum. Finding time for MH in the busy teaching schedule is  another problem. In KISTMC, the MH module is conducted from 8 am  onwards and the early hour creates difficulties for faculty members.
				</p>
				<p>
					My advice is: before starting MH training, each medical school  should chalk out the learning objectives of the module. I am not in  favor of a uniform, didactic module imposed by an external authority. I  feel MH should spring from the creativity of the faculty in each  institution. Faculty interested in the humanities could play a key role  in driving MH forward. The sessions should be activity-based and  conducted in small groups. A voluntary module can be initially offered  and later schools may explore a module for all students. I feel it is  extremely important to preserve the "fun" nature of the module and  create a protected and friendly environment. Faculty involved should be  familiar with small group dynamics and facilitating activity-based  learning. Sharing of experiences between medical educators involved in  MH in the region is important and a mechanism for this should be worked out.
