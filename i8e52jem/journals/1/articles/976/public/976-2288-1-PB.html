				<h4>Ranbaxy pleads guilty to adulteration charges</h4>
				<p>
					In a blow to India's growing reputation as the "pharmacy of
					the world", the US Department of Justice has imposed fines
					in civil and criminal cases, up to a total of $500 million, on
					Ranbaxy USA Inc, a subsidiary of the Indian pharma major,
					Ranbaxy Laboratories. The company pleaded guilty to charges
					of adulteration of drugs produced at its plants in Paonta Sahib
					and Dewas in India. The Department of Justice has stated that
					the company admitted that inspections of the Dewas facility
					by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and
					2008 found evidence of incomplete testing records, and an
					inadequate stability programme and manufacturing practices,
					in breach of regulations. The company also pleaded guilty to
					making fraudulent statements to the FDA about how it tested
					drugs at two of its Indian plants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Daiichi Sankhyo, which purchased the company
					from the Singh family, has also filed a complaint against the
					former owners for non-disclosure of the details of the US
					investigation before its purchase of the company. To those
					concerned with access to affordable healthcare for all, this
					seems a prophecy foretold. If a big drug manufacturer like
					Ranbaxy can be so negligent in the US market, known for its
					stringent quality control, one can only imagine the quality
					of the generic drugs in the Indian market. Also, the silence of
					the Indian health authorities on the subject is deafening. It is
					reported that the government has asked the Drugs Controller
					General's office to re-examine the documents based on which
					approvals have so far been granted to the company.

				<h4>Central scheme for free generic medicines shelved</h4>
				<p>
					The much-hyped plan to supply free generic medicines at
					government health centres and hospitals for one year has been
					shelved by the health ministry. The scheme, with a planned
					budget of Rs 6000 crore per year, has been discarded due
					to financial constraints and the failure to put in place a drug
					procurement policy over the past 18 months. The states have
					now been asked to formulate their own schemes for the supply
					of free drugs and seek funds under the National Rural Health
					Mission.
				</p>
				<p>
					The move to make it mandatory for doctors to prescribe drugs
					by their generic rather than brand names also seems to have
					fizzled out. The only step taken in that direction so far has been a circular issued by the Medical Council of India to government medical colleges and hospitals earlier this year, but it had little effect.
				</p>
				<p>
					The plan to provide free generic drugs was recommended in
					the report of the high-level expert group (HLEG) appointed in
					2011 to look into the Universal Health Coverage plan. The HLEG
					had found that medicines accounted for 76% of out-of-pocket
					expenditure on health.
				</p>
				<p>
					A government official said, "We have neither the kind of
					resources that a nationwide free drugs scheme requires, nor
					the infrastructure to ensure glitch-free procurement and
					distribution of drugs. Attempting something so ambitious
					without the infrastructure would amount to courting trouble,
					and even possible litigations. At this moment we can only
					support states if they formulate their schemes and come to
					us with adequate facilities for warehousing and an IT-enabled
					supply chain. Many states have started giving free drugs too."

				<h4>Free medicine scheme in Rajasthan sees more girls
				getting treatment</h4>
				<p>
					A study of the scheme for free medicines being implemented
					in Rajasthan has revealed that there has been a twofold to
					threefold increase in the treatment of girl children (0-6 years
					of age) in the six months since October 2012, when the scheme
					became operational. The highest increase has been in Jhalawar
					district, where there has been a threefold rise in the number of
					girl children in this age group being brought for treatment. In
					Barmer district, the increase has been 90%-100%. The report
					says, "In simple terms, now that the medicines are 'free', people
					are finally flocking to hospitals to avail treatment for their girl children, implying they were not being treated whenever it
					implied a financial cost."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Hemant Acharya from the organisation, Save the Child, said,
					"With the government initiative of free medicine, free medical
					tests, and schemes like the Shubh Laxmi Yojna, people are now
					willing to bring their girl child for medical attention, which will be a boon to save the female child." Around 10 crore people
					in the state are reported to have benefited from the scheme in
					the seven months since its inception.

				<h4>Women health activists hounded</h4>
				<p>
					A five-year-old case has been revived against Madhuri
					Krishnaswami, a health activist working with tribal communities
					in the district of Barwani, Madhya Pradesh. The court ordered
					her arrest in connection with a case registered against her
					and others in 2008 for their protests against corruption in
					the healthcare facilities of the state. The activist works with
					the Jagrit Adivasi Dalit Sanghatan and had exposed several
					instances of corruption in programmes implemented under
					the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee
					Act. The report mentions that the local officials tried to have
					her externed from the area, but failed due to the protests of
					the citizens. The judge suggested that Krishnaswami apply for
					bail and when she refused to do so, sent her to jail on 14 days
					judicial remand. Residents of the area have been staging sit in
					protests at six police stations in the district, demanding the
					immediate release of the activist.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Soni Sori, an adivasi teacher and activist, has been
					in jail for over 17 months. She has complained that she was
					subjected to brutal sexual torture, including having stones
					forced into her private parts, by the Chattisgarh police in
					October 2011. Her complaints were reportedly dismissed by
					the Raipur medical authorities, which claimed that she was
					"malingering" or feigning illness. It was only after the Supreme
					Court's intervention that she was re-examined by doctors in
					Kolkata and treated for her injuries. To add insult to injury, the
					government of Chattisgarh has now announced that she will
					be made to undergo a "psychiatric examination".
				</p>
				<p>
					Groups of women activists nationwide have protested against
					this as being a malafide move to declare her of unsound mind,
					thus paving the way for the dismissal of her allegations of
					police brutality. They have also condemned the statement of
					a member of the team of the National Commission of Women
					which visited the activist that Sori was doing fine and only
					needed psychological counselling. This remark is said to have
					been the basis of the state government's plan to put Sori
					through a psychiatric examination.

					The Medical Council of India (MCI) is to be reconstituted,

					Governors.
				</p>
				<p>
					The medical regulator will have a seven-member board,
					approved by health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, and will serve
					for a term of six months, within which elections will be held
					and the MCI's original democratic structure restored.
				</p>
				<p>
					A bill to this effect will have to be passed in Parliament. The government has issued an ordinance for the formation of
					the new MCI Board of Governors which is to run the medical
					regulatory body.
				</p>
				<p>
					The term of the last Board of Governors expired on May 13,
					making it necessary for the government to issue an ordinance
					for the formation of a new board to run the MCI until
					Parliament passes the new Indian Medical Council Amendment
					Act. The latter provides for the restoration of an elected MCI
					and fixes the tenure of its president to root out corruption.

				<h4>Quinvaxem vaccination suspended in Viet Nam</h4>
				<p>
					The use of Quinvaxem, a vaccine meant to prevent five
					common, potentially fatal childhood diseases-diphtheria
					(D), tetanus (T), pertussis (P, whooping cough), hepatitis
					B (HepB), and haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), was
					suspended by the Viet Nam ministry of health on May 4.
					This followed reports of at least nine deaths of vaccinated
					infants and numerous cases of serious allergic reactions
					over the preceding six months. The infants had reportedly
					been in good health before being vaccinated, but suffered
					convulsions and died soon after vaccination. Several tests
					were conducted to investigate the matter, but the vaccine
					was not found to be directly linked with either the deaths
					or the allergic reactions. Nor was there any evidence to
					exclude the vaccine as a cause of the adverse effects. The
					reports say that the cases were from different provinces,
					and the batches of vaccine were of good quality and met all
					the requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to a government spokesperson, 20 out of 42 batches
					of the vaccine were followed by minor to severe allergic
					reactions. The spokesman said whole-cell pertussis vaccines,
					like Quinvaxem, were among those that gave rise to the
					maximum number of allergic reactions. Now that a decision
					has been taken to stop using Quinvaxem, the government has
					to decide on which substitutes can be used to avoid a gap in
					the immunisation of infants.

				<h4>Patients' right to refuse information</h4>
				<p>
					The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
					(ACMG) recently recommended that during genetic
					sequencing for any medical reason, 57 other specific genes
					must also be examined for incidental findings, and both the
					doctor concerned and the patient must be informed of the
					results. Further, the ACMG clarified that failure to report the
					information would be considered unethical. The only way a
					patient can avoid having 57 genes tested is by refusing the
					gene sequencing altogether.
				</p>
				<p>
					This step has led to a huge controversy, with Megan Alysse
					and Marsha Michie of the Stanford University of Biomedical
					Ethics arguing that while patients have the right to be given
					information on their health, no one has the right to force
					information on them if they do not wish to receive it. The
					ACMG's recommendation has also been attacked on the
					ground that such testing is very expensive.
				</p>
				<p>
					"No one should be able to interfere with your ability to accept
					or decline access. We think that's where these recommendations
					are problematic, because they do suggest that your physician
					should interfere in that decision by essentially saying, 'You have
					to accept this information.' And there is certainly evidence that
					some people do not want information about long-term health
					risks, especially in children," say the two researchers.

				<h4>Spinning money from new technologies</h4>
				<p>
					A comment in the <em>Economic and Political Weekly</em> advises a
					cautious approach to the media hype about the double
					mastectomy which the Hollywood actress, Angelina Jolie, opted for, apparently as a precaution against the threat posed
					by a genetic predisposition to breast cancer. Media reports
					have been applauding this step as a brave one and one which
					will encourage other women to deal with the threat of breast
					cancer. The writer expresses "an instinctive mistrust of the
					manner in which modern technology in the last few decades
					has invaded and displaced all other forms of medical care,
					creating simultaneously a kind of pseudo-scientific common
					sense".
				</p>
				<p>
					Applying this to the Jolie case, she says "the liberal references
					to percentages", as in the percentage risk of cancer, "without
					ever clarifying sample sizes, racial or national contexts, or age
					profiles, is a classic instance of the misuse of statistics. Most
					reports mention hitherto unheard of genes (except presumably
					in medical circles) and within a mere 48 hours or so the BRCA
					gene has achieved a resounding degree of notoriety. The
					combination of math and science in this fashion, needless
					to say, is a noxious cocktail. And as a marketing strategy, not
					entirely unfamiliar." The writer expresses her increasing mistrust of a medical industry that rakes in huge profits by creating anxiety about the possibility of potential health risks. This is discussed in the context of the proliferation of two proven "money spinners": preventive hysterectomies and assisted
					reproductive technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The comment asserts that while women in particular must be
					encouraged to take charge of their own bodies, this "cannot
					happen in the absence of a demand for greater accountability
					and transparency from the medical scientific empire, whose
					solutions are invariably industry-driven." It also stresses the
					need to press governments and the medical establishment
					to invest in projects aimed at understanding the relationship
					between food, lifestyle, environment and changing global
					health trends, and to conduct research in this area.
