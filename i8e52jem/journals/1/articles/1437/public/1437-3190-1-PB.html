				<h4>A deadline to wait for</h4>
				<p>
					The  Delhi government has constituted a committee to review existing free treatment  facilities extended by charitable and other hospitals allotted land on  concessional terms by the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  committee will suggest suitable policy guidelines for free treatment facilities  for needy and deserving patients uniformly in the beneficiary institutions. It  will also recommend a proper referral system for optimum utilisation of free  treatment by needy patients and a suitable enforcement and monitoring mechanism  for this, including a legal framework.
				</p>
				<p>
					It  should submit its recommendations within three months.

					A  public interest litigation in the Supreme Court calls for action to stop  clinics from offering sex-selection with in-vitro fertilisation. Sabu George  (co-petitioners include CEHAT, Mumbai and MASUM, Pune) has called for a move to  ban this effort to bypass the law preventing prenatal sex selection.

				<h4>Remember the oath you took?</h4>
				<p>
					The chairperson of the  Indian National Human Rights Commission urged members of the medical profession  to adhere strictly to the Hippocratic oath to protect the human rights of  patients and of people as a whole. Speaking at a seminar in Bhopal on human rights  and the medical profession, Mr Justice JS Verma called the medical profession  one of the noblest of vocations since it deals directly with the right to life  and physical and mental security. Referring to the report of an AIDS patient  who was turned away by hospital authorities in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, the  chairperson said that doctors had a great responsibility to appreciate the  human rights of AIDS patients.

				<h4>The guardians of our health</h4>
				<p>
					A drunk government  doctor created havoc in a primary health centre at Mahim near Palghar,  Maharashtra. Dr VV Patil, newly transferred from Talasari, used to be drunk all  day. On one occasion, he entered the PHC, threw papers around and abused staff.  After the incident was reported the police took a blood tests to check his  alcohol level. The district health officer has promised 'stringent action'  against the doctor once the test report is received. The remote location of  this PHC apparently encourages doctors to play truant. More interesting  details: the compounder, Ramesh Pander, on whose complaint the police took  action, apparently did so because he wanted to assert his political clout; he's  known for his 'roving eye'. And another, senior doctor at the PHC, Dr Raut,  passes his time gambling with medical workers while on duty.

					The Indian Medical  Association elections for the post of national president degenerated into  fisticuffs between an impassioned observer and contestant at the Tardeo office  in Mumbai. Some 1,800 members of the IMA were to cast their vote by secret  ballot. However, the three observers authorised by various candidates to ensure  that no unfair practice was followed, were prevented from entering the voting  room. A verbal duel ensued, and the police were called in.

				<h4>Out of stock</h4>

					More than 300 nurses  from the Sassoon hospital in Pune, and part of the Maharashtra Government  Nurses Federation demonstrated outside the hospital to protest the inadequate  supply of basic equipment. Basic items like bed sheets, soaps and life-saving  drugs are in short supply. "When a patient is admitted we can't give them a  clean mattress." Even sterilisation facilities are inadequate, and needles and  saline sets are in short supply. About 5,000 patients visit the hospital on any  given day.

				<h4>Panel for genome research</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian government's  department of biotechnology has set up a National Bioethics Committee to  prepare guidelines for research in genomics. The committee has been set up to  fulfill obligations under the UNESCO Declaration on the Human Genome and Human  Rights, to which India is a signatory.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  panel will be different from the proposed Ethical Review Committee to be set up  by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is currently finalising  a comprehensive set of ethical guidelines to regulate biomedical research  involving human participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					"There  will be some overlap in functioning of the two panels. Probably there could be  some sort of co-operation between them later on", commented an ICMR official .  However, the biotechnology department feels that ICMR will be providing only  broad guidelines and that will apply to all medical research. The panel set up  by the department will focus on genomic research alone and will have powers of  implementation.

				<h4>Doctor versus doctor? Sorry...</h4>
				<p>
					Patients claiming  damages for medical negligence are often unable to prove their allegations  because doctors are unwilling to testify against other doctors. This was one of  the conclusions of a study by the Voluntary Organisation in Interest of  Consumer Education, New Delhi, after examining grievance redressal mechanisms  in 81 large hospitals and small clinics and 86 cases of alleged medical  negligence filed in consumer courts in Delhi, Hyderabad, and Lucknow. The study  was supported by the Indian health ministry and the World Bank.
				</p>
				<p>
					More  than half the hospitals surveyed did not have mechanisms to manage complaints  from patients or their relatives. Patients usually turned to consumer courts  only after trying to resolve their grievances with their doctors or hospitals,  according to the study. Yet doctors refuse to testify, and hospitals refuse to  provide patients their medical records.

				<h4>Infected material kills</h4>
				<p>
					The use of infected,  date expired items in the Gobind Ballabh Pant hospital in Delhi contributed to  the deaths of at least 26 patients in the 1990s, an expert inquiry team has  found.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  team was appointed on the basis of complaints filed in 1998 by the People's  Union of Civil Liberties against the hospital, several of its doctors, and a  former health minister of Delhi. The case refers to major corruption deals  through irregular purchases in the 1990s running into several crores of rupees.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  date expired material implicated in hospital acquired infections and deaths was  purchased in the early 1990s and used on patients until around 1998.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  expert committee said that hospital records demonstrated an organised attempt  by the hospital administration, through orders and circulars, to use the  expired materials, which included catheters and heart valves, many of which  were more than five years old. There was damage, discoloration, visible fungal  growth, and overall contamination of these items.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hospital  records showed that some non-expired materials also had growth of  Staphylococcus aureus. Date expired materials were sterilised again but still  tested positive for contamination and were used anyway.

				<h4>Rules for hospitals at last!</h4>
				<p>
					Country-wide guidelines  for minimum standards in hospitals and nursing homes will be the first step  towards regulation of these health facilities, several of which function  without laboratories, technical assistants and the minimum equipment. Out of 23  cities with populations of above one million, only nursing homes in Delhi and  Mumbai are covered under certain municipal laws, says the Voluntary Health  Association of India, and these deal more with the housing facilities than  technical requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  guidelines will need to be adopted by the states and the monitoring authority  will be the state governments. However, they will not cover the conduct of  medical professionals &mdash; an area which the Medical Council of India has to take  up.
				</p>
				<p>
					The guidelines provide a schedule of the basic infrastructure for a hospital  including blood banking facilities, laboratory support, operation theatres and  equipment. If adopted and enforced through adequate regulatory mechanisms,  several hospitals in the country would be forced to either update their  equipment or simply close down.

				<h4>Counseling AIDS patients</h4>
				<p>
					The recent suicide  attempt in Mumbai by an AIDS patient who also poisoned his wife and killed his  two minor children, has raised concern regarding the counselling given to HIV  positive patients in public hospitals.
				</p>
				<p>
					While  counselling is mandatory in all public hospitals, there are not many  professionally qualified counsellors, especially compared to the number of  patients coming to these hospitals every day, and the time spent with each  patient is insufficient to discuss all aspects of the disease and coping with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Counselling  of HIV positive patients requires skilled counsellors and it cannot be done by  the junior-most person in the department, which is the case in hospitals at  present,'' says a senior doctor in a public hospital, adding that the  counselling patients get when the doctor gives them the report is not enough.  Patients should be told they can lead a normal life with proper diet and  exercise, and take charge of their lives..

				<h4>We get it free and charge you...</h4>
				<p>
					Patients in the Jaslok  Hospital cardiology department are being charged Rs 40,000 for coronary stents  that the company supplied free to the doctors for "pre-marketing trials". When  Mr GNV died following treatment by Dr AB Mehta, his son noticed that the  hospital bill included two S-7 coronary stents worth Rs 40,500 each and two  angioplasty balloons worth Rs 15,000 each. The S-7 stent manufactured by  Medtronics Inc is under pre-marketing trials and supplied free to  cardiologists. Dr Mehta claims this was a billing mistake.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why  is the company conducting trials in India for a product which has not yet been  cleared for marketing in the West? Because in the West, clinical trials can  only be conducted with FDA permission or after the hospital ethics committee  examines the proposal in excruciating detail and satisfies itself that proper  safeguards are in place. In India, patients often do not know they are being  treated by trial equipment.

				<h4>The poor pay more</h4>
				<p>
					The Rajkumar kidnapping  has overshadowed a prolonged agitation launched by various organisations in  Mysore to protest the hike in consultation, treatment and ward charges at  government-run hospitals. Dalit leader Govindaraju said, "Although the state  government feels it has calculated the new rates scientifically, and the lower  middle class may not feel the effect, just think of the community below that  line." He alleged that hospital staff collect double the amount of fees  prescribed from the poor. S.O. Palekar, chief secretary of Health and family  planning department, medical education, claims the government has implemented  the decision only after talking to all sections of people besides considering  the hi-tech services provided at the hospital and increase in the cost of  manufacturing medicines.

The IMA's secretary general says, "A mere income tax raid  does not prove anything. If he is prosecuted, then the matter would go to our  ethics committee." The health minister responded to a demand to remove him from  various posts with the comment: "Let the investigations be over then we will  see." Desai said "it was not a tax raid, but a routine survey."

				<h4>Drug deal</h4>
				<p>
					The United States has  offered 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa five-year loans totalling $1billion,  at 7% annual interest, to buy anti-AIDS drugs. The drug would have to be bought  from US manufacturers. The offer has been condemned by Oxfam as "a debt that  tomorrow's AIDS orphans will be forced to pay."
				</p>
				<p>
					"The  deal amounts to a credit-line which locks poor countries into buying expensive  patented drugs, when what they need is help to make or buy low cost generic  equivalents," Oxfam said in a press release.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oxfam  accused the United States of setting up the deal to help the drug companies  fight off competition from generic drugs that can be manufactured locally.  Brazil and India, for example, currently manufacture anti-AIDS drugs at a  fraction of the cost of those marketed by multinational pharmaceutical  companies.

				<h4>Cloning is okay</h4>

				<h4>Advertising or public announcement?</h4>
				<p>
					SmithKline Beecham  Mackwoods is accused of breaking guidelines of Sri Lanka's Cosmetic Devices and  Drugs Authority because television advertisements and hoardings for its drug  Panadol do not mention the drug's generic name, paracetamol. The guidelines are  based on the WHO's ethical criteria for medicinal drug promotion.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  brand name appears hourly on Sri Lanka's national television on a clock face  announcing the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  company claims, however, that neither the clock face nor the name boards are  advertisements since they do not list the product's benefits; the clock face is  a 'public service message'
				</p>
				<p>
					Regulators  suspect that SmithKline Beecham, which is forced to include generic names in  advertisements worldwide, is making an exception in the case of Sri Lanka  because it has limited resources to police the industry.

				<h4>Awkward alliance</h4>
				<p>
					Back to SmithKline.... The  manufacturer of a chickenpox vaccine has linked up with associations of  paediatricians and family physicians in Israel for an ad campaign urging  parents to get their children vaccinated against chickenpox. The health  ministry fears it will be pressurised by parents to include the expensive  vaccine in the state-subsidised immunisation programme despite the high natural  immunity to the disease. The head of the public health service commented that  "any immunisation effort financed by the pharmaceutical company that produces  the vaccine poses ethical problems." Extra money should be spent on a newer  safer vaccine against whooping cough; chickenpox is a low priority. Also, the  public health service favours giving all children a uniform basket of  vaccinations, and not encouraging well-off parents to give their offspring  shots that poor families cannot afford.

				<h4>Unsafe research</h4>
				<p>
					The US government halted  all federally funded human research at the University of Oklahoma College of  Medicine charging that researchers in a melanoma vaccine trial had breached  safety regulations and the university's institutional review board (IRB) failed  to provide adequate supervision.
				</p>
				<p>
					Independent  auditors found personnel producing the vaccine were unqualified; participants  received vaccines improperly tested for viral and bacterial contaminants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though  the trial was stopped following auditors' recommendations, the principal  investigator wrote to patients and investigators that there were no safety  issues. In addition to this misrepresentation, the Office of Human Research  Protections found that the trial's informed-consent documents overstated the  possible benefits of participation in the trial, a phase I safety study. The university's  IRB had not monitored the trial properly, and changes were made to the trial's  protocol without IRB approval.
				</p>
				<p>
					Restructuring  the university's system for protecting human participants would include  "changes in leadership and an enhanced institutional commitment to human  subject protections".

				<h4>The will of God or the law?</h4>
				<p>
					As we go to press, the  dilemma continues on whether conjoined twins can be surgically separated so  that one can survive resulting in the certain death of the other twin.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  August, a UK high court judge ruled that the twins can be separated against  their parents' wishes to save the life of the stronger baby, even though the  operation will kill the weaker twin. The parents have appealed the ruling and  further consultations are now on.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  twins &mdash; "Mary" and "Jodie" are the names assigned for the public &mdash; were born to  Roman Catholic parents in southern Europe who came to Britain for the birth  after it was realised that the foetuses were conjoined.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both  twins will die within six months unless separated. With an operation, Jodie is  likely to live with some disability, but Mary will die, because she relies on  Jodie's heart and lungs for her blood supply.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  babies' parents asked that no operation should be carried out and that "God's  will" should prevail. They said that their community did not have the  facilities to cope with Jodie's disabilities and they would have to leave her  in Britain.
				</p>
				<p>
					A  key issue in the case is whether it would be lawful to end Mary's life to save  Jodie or whether this would amount to unlawful killing. It could come down to  whether Mary, who has a primitive brain, a useless heart, and non-functioning  lungs and relies on Jodie as her life support system, is a person in her own  right.
