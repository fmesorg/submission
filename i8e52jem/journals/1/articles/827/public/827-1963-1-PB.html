					The  Supreme Court declared on August 4, 2004, in Dr Suresh Gupta's Criminal Appeal  [Appeal (crl.) 778 of 2004] that to sustain a prosecution for the offence under  S. 304A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and to fix criminal liability on a  doctor or surgeon, the standard of negligence required to be proved should be  so high that it can be described as 'gross negligence' or 'recklessness', not  merely lack of necessary care. On those premises it quashed the criminal  proceedings against Dr Gupta before they reached trial in the Magistrate's  Court.
				</p>
				<p>
					Until  this judgment came out, a precedent was set by the decision of the Supreme  Court dated February 4, 2004, in Mohanan v. Prabha G Nair and another (2004)  CPJ 21(SC). In this case, a woman in the seventh month of pregnancy underwent  medical intervention and delivered a dead child on the next day. She passed  away three days later, while under medical care. The husband alleged in his  police complaint that though he repeatedly asked for permission to remove his  wife to a medical college hospital, the doctor advised against the shift saying  that the patient had no serious problem and that everything would turn out all  right. Subsequent events obviously proved otherwise.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based  on the opinion of the radiologist and the doctor who conducted the autopsy, the  Criminal Court took cognisance of the offence punishable under S.304A of the  IPC. The doctor petitioned to quash the proceedings invoking S. 482 of the  Criminal Procedure Code, on the ground that there was no prima facie case. The  concerned High Court held that the mere fact that a patient dies in a hospital  does not lead to the presumption that the death occurred due to the doctor's  negligence. To hold a doctor criminally responsible for a patient's death, it  must be established that there was negligence or incompetence on the doctor's  part, which went beyond civil liability. Criminal liability would arise only if  the doctor did something in disregard to the patient's life and safety.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Supreme Court, however, set aside the said High Court decision holding that the  doctor's negligence could be ascertained only by scanning all material and  expert evidence that might be adduced during the trial. The High Court was held  not justified in quashing the complaint at the threshold invoking the special  power under S. 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code as that would do away with a  full-fledged criminal trial necessary for fixing criminal liability.

				<h4>Relevant  legal provisions</h4>
				<p>
					According to S. 304A of the IPC, whoever causes the death of any person by a  rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide shall be punished by  imprisonment for up to two years, or by fine, or both.
				</p>
				<p>
					According  to S. 80 of the IPC, 'nothing is an offence which is done by accident or  misfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a  lawful act, in a lawful manner, by lawful means and with proper care and  caution.' In other words, if a person commits an act by accident or misfortune  without a criminal intention, using lawful means and with proper care and  caution, his action cannot be labelled a criminal offence.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again,  S. 88 of the IPC provides that nothing which is not intended to cause death, is  an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer  to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for  whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether  express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm. In  other words, an act, not intended to cause death, and done in good faith and  with the consent of the other party, cannot be labelled an offence even if it  leads to the other party's death or disability. It may also be mentioned here  that the word 'good faith' used here has a special meaning. It means an act  done wih due care and attention.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let us  analyse the recent Supreme Court decision in the light of the legal positions  stated above.
				</p>
				<p>
					On  April 18, 1994, Dr Suresh Gupta, a plastic surgeon, operated on his patient for  removing a nasal deformity. Allegedly, he made an incorrect incision as a  result of which blood seeped into the patient's respiratory passage leading to  his immediate collapse and death. A case was filed against the doctor under S.  304A of the IPC. The anaesthetist who assisted Dr Gupta in the operation was  also made co-accused; but he died while the trial was pending. The criminal  proceedings therefore continued against Dr Gupta alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rejecting  Dr Gupta's plea for discharge without trial, the magistrate noted that  according to the post-mortem report, the cause of death was 'blockage of  respiratory passage by aspirated blood consequent upon surgically incised  margin of nasal septum'; that the medical experts constituting the Special  Medical Board set up for the investigation had opined that the blockage and  aspiration of blood from the wound were not likely to arise if a cuffed  endotracheal tube of proper size had been introduced before the operation and  kept intact, and that the negligence in not taking this precaution justified  further trial proceedings.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Supreme Court did not agree to this. It has now held that to fix criminal  liability on a doctor or surgeon, the standard of negligence required to be  proved should be so high that it can be described as gross negligence or  recklessness and not merely lack of necessary care, attention and skill. Every  careless act of a medical person cannot be termed 'criminal'. It can be termed  'criminal' only when doctors exhibit gross lack of competence or inaction, and  wanton indifference to their patients' safety, as a result of gross ignorance  or gross negligence. When a patient's death results merely from an error of  judgment or an accident, no criminal liability should be attached to it. Mere  inadvertence or some degree of want of adequate care and caution might create  civil liability; but not criminal liability. It was held that but for this  approach, the hazards in the medical profession which include civil liability  would also unreasonably extend to criminal liability, and doctors would then be  at the risk of landing up in prison, a result that would shake the mutual  confidence between doctor and patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based  on these facts, the Supreme Court held that though the patient was a young man  with no history of any heart ailment, the operation to be performed for nasal  deformity was not so complicated or serious; and that the alleged lapse, i.e.  the failure to introduce a cuffed endotracheal tube of proper size to prevent  aspiration of blood from the wound in the respiratory passage, could not be  described as a reckless or grossly negligent act as to make him criminally  liable. Holding that such evidence was wanting, the doctor was acquitted  without trial.
				</p>
				<p>
					Were  these findings not similar to those held by the High Court concerned, though in  different words in Mohanan's case, but found unsustainable by the Supreme Court  then? If the quashing of the charge with the observation that the doctor's  negligence could be ascertained only by scanning the material and expert  evidence that might be adduced during a prospective trial was not in order in  Mohanan's case, how could the reason given for quashing charges in Dr Suresh  Gupta's case be correct?
				</p>
				<p>
					It  appears that if the decision in Mohanan's case had been followed by the later  Bench that decided Dr Suresh Gupta's case, the ultimate decision might have  been different. Probably the earlier decision was not cited before the new  Bench.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  impact of the judgment, though significant, may be short lived. The reason is  that according to press reports, a Bench consisting of Justice Arijit Pasayat  and CK Thakker, on or about September 9, 2004, has referred the question of  medical negligence for determination by a larger Bench of the Supreme Court  observing that the words 'gross, reckless, competence, indifference' etc. did  not occur anywhere in the definition of 'negligence' under S. 304A of the IPC,  and hence, they could not agree with the judgment delivered in the case of Dr  Suresh Gupta. Thus the matter will come up for review before a larger bench of  the Supreme Court any time now.
