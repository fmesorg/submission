					First,  do no harm. By Lisa Belkin, Simon and Schuster, New  York 1993. ISBN 0-671-68538-4.
				</h4>
				<p>
					Lisa Belkin, a reporter  for the New York Times, spent three years observing the ethics committee in a  large private hospital in the US. The hospital cares for adults and children  but her focus in this book is on the world of the ill children, the difficult  choices their parents and the medical staff face in taking care of these  children and how the ethics committee interacts with both to help them arrive  at decisions.

				<h4>'Difficult dilemmas'</h4>
				<p>
					As Ms  Belkin writes, ethics committees are a recent phenomenon. It is only in the  last two or three decades that medical progress has provided choices to both  patients and doctors. Before that time, medical or surgical treatment could not  prolong life sufficiently to require decisions to continue treatment or not. As  technology now allows premature babies and children with chronic, debilitating  illnesses to live on seemingly forever, we are confronted with difficult  dilemmas. Will the baby have a meaningful quality of life? Who will provide  ongoing care for a completely paralysed young man? Who will bear the cost of  enormously expensive drugs, surgical procedures and hospital stay? What if  patients or caretakers want everything done when the prognosis is hopeless &mdash; or  what if they want to give up too soon?
				</p>
				<p>
					With permission from the  patients and the medical staff, the book describes a few cases in detail. What  come through are the anguish, helplessness, uncertainty and eventually  emotional and physical exhaustion of the parents. The author is equally good at  describing the uncertainties inherent in medical science that doctors face  daily as they make, and help parents make, life and death decisions, and the  toll that this takes on the doctors' and nurses' psyches. It has become  fashionable to blame doctors or hospital administrators for denying care that  some patients see as their fundamental right. This book shows how society has  left these people to take the heat while the policymakers, legislators, and  insurers move ever so slowly to keep up with the complexities of today's health  care.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ms Belkin describes how  the first ethics committee was formed at this hospital at the insistence of the  hospital chaplain. Chaired by the chief of nursing, the membership has  gradually expanded to bring in people from different disciplines with an  attempt to provide scientific and emotional balance. The committee also  includes persons outside the hospital staff, in this case, former patients or  patient relatives/friends. The committee has policy meetings and also case  consultations. The last was unusual at the time the book was written but is  fairly standard now at all hospitals that have ethics committees.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyone can ask the  committee to consult on a case where they feel that the patient's care is being  compromised. It could be a doctor, a nurse, a medical social worker, patient or  patient's family. It could even be a rank outsider, though this is very rare.  Once the committee convenes, the person requesting the consultation is asked to  tell the group why she/he feel that the care is less than optimal, either too  little or too much. Usually the family members who have requested the meeting  attend as a group. The patient, too, is welcome but often too sick to  participate. After the information is given, the family leaves the room while  the group deliberates. Privacy allows members of the group to give their  opinions without worry about hurting the family's feelings or fear of  repercussions. Then the family returns to hear the group's decision which is  never binding; it is merely advice that they are free to reject. The opinion of  the group is explained without medical jargon and the family is not under any  pressure to make quick, irrevocable decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite such support and  extensive discussion, the decisions are still very hard. The parties involved  are often in two minds about whether they have made the right decision. It is  therefore not surprising that in the concluding section where Ms Belkin  describes the consequences, several decisions appear in retrospect to have not  produced the desired outcome. Yet she describes how different people cope with  these. Life goes on

				<h4>No saints, no villains</h4>
				<p>
					I  found this book very touching and also very informative. It describes the  complicated interactions that take place in a hospital between the patients,  their caretakers, and the medical staff without trying to ascribe blame. There  are no saints and no villains. Contrary to popular stereotypes, patients and  their caretakers can be manipulative, excessively demanding and just plain  'pain in the ass'; hospital administrators can be caring and strive to bend  rules to benefit patients; medical staff can be so emotionally attached to  their patients as to almost become surrogates for them, while others maintain a  professional but distant attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethics committees are  not common in Indian hospitals. Whether you are already a member of an ethics  committee or are thinking of setting up one, this little book will give you  valuable insight into the establishment and running of an ethics committee in a  general hospital.
