					The  work of medical professionals is perhaps even more intricate than that of many  other professions. It is also more trying because the pain and suffering of ill  people is visible and discomforting not only to the patient but to the people  around. The physician or surgeon has a three-fold responsibility: to be well  versed in the scientific aspects of medicine, to possess adequate clinical  skills and, finally, to have an attitude that is ethical and humane. A  deficiency in any of these three attributes should be considered a professional  deficiency.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, knowledge and skills are more easily measured by objective parameters  than are intangibles like attitude. Is the doctor really listening to the  patient's anxious recounting of aches and pains, or has she/he already made up  her/ his mind? Is "informed consent' taken so that the patient undergoes a  procedure voluntarily with complete knowledge of the risks and benefits &mdash; or to  protect the doctor from legal liability? Such questions evaluate more than  behaviour, they look at the doctor's attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is perhaps one reason doctors being evaluated for their proficiency are  rarely, if ever, assessed for their humaneness. As a result, over time, they  start ignoring the importance of patient empathy and communication. One often  finds practitioners working hard to acquire the latest in medical knowledge, or  honing their clinical skills. One rarely finds them working at developing and  maintaining a humanitarian attitude. It is fair to say that such physicians are  more inclined to be driven to prescribe drugs or therapies for reasons other  than their patients' benefit.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, increasingly dramatic and fascinating (to the surgeon) forms of  therapy are being developed at a dizzy pace. This has led to their mindless  application and to specialisation and super-specialisation as the route to  acquiring deeper insight. The result is a focused pursuit of increasingly  shrinking areas of work for the individual practitioner &mdash; pushing all other  areas out of the scope of interest, including some vital (albeit intangible)  aspects of medical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Yet it is obvious that medical practice cannot be meaningful unless it caters  to the needs of the community within which it operates. A physician's worth  depends on the relevance of his or her work to the people he or she serves.  Physicians' concern for such relevance is, to a large extent, the outcome of  their medical education and nurture. Sadly, it is quite apparent that such  nurture is declining &mdash; to the peril of the community to which the physician  caters.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst behavioural changes can more easily be instilled through training  programmes, attitudinal changes need persistent nurture in medical school as  well as throughout professional practice. Unfortunately, barring a few  exceptions, medical ethics has never been a serious subject in medical  education syllabi in our country. As medical education gets further  commercialised, there is little hope for change in this area.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few isolated efforts to institute hospital ethics committees and  institutional review boards seek to make appropriate behavioral changes in  medical practice. More, evidently, needs to be done to address the question of  subtle positive attitudinal changes from the very beginning of medical  education.
				</p>
				<p>
					Such inputs are difficult to devise but not impossible, evidenced by the  efforts of the St. John's Medical College in Bangalore, which includes ethics  education as an essential component of its syllabus. Likewise, the Halo Medical  Foundation (a product of past students and staff of Aurangabad Medical College)  sends its members to work with students in community work, where debates take  place on ethics and social justice and the role of health care professionals  and institutions. Working within communities helps strengthen empathy; break  cultural barriers and build new relationships between students and the  community. Meaningful medical practice necessitates an awareness of the ground  realities of a community's needs.

					I suggest that there are three types of doctors. The surgeon who boasts of his  or her surgical skills in amputation, or holds that an electronic artificial  foot is a significant achievement and represents the best that science has to  offer, is misleading the community &mdash; and may even be called unethical. The  procedure is expensive, of limited value, can even create its own disabilities,  and is not an adequate response to the problems faced by the people the surgeon  treats. The surgeon who offers the procedure believing that there is no other  option &mdash; but acknowledging its limitations &mdash; can be called "passively ethical'.  But the surgeon who says, "Surely there must be a better solution, one which  the people I treat can afford and use," and develops something like the Jaipur  foot: that is a positively ethical doctor

					This subject is discussed from a number of different perspectives in this issue  of the journal. In what is clearly a cry from the heart, Dr PK Sethi <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sethi PK: Orthopaedics in an unjust world: whither Indian orthopaedics. Issues in medical ethics. 1999: VII (3): 85-88." id="1">(1)</a> describes the decline of truly innovative orthopaedics, and calls for action.  This reflection on and assessment of the field of orthopaedics to the community  of poor, rural Indians identifies numerous areas which specialists could work  in to make useful contributions to their society.

					In another essay, Sarita Agarwal <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Agarwal S: From the other side. Issues in medical ethics. 1999: VII (3): 90-91" id="2">(2)</a> describes her own encounters with the  medical profession and suggests that simple decency, consideration and empathy  could make a world of a difference for people undergoing both physical and  mental stress.
