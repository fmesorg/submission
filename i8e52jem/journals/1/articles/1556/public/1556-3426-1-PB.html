				<h4>Attitude of doctors  towards such patients</h4>
				<p>
					Persons testing positive for infection by HIV or showing evidence of AIDS  provoke revulsion and fear in medical doctors. These reactions stem from the  general knowledge that the diagnosis of AIDS is akin to a death sentence and  the belief that a positive HIV test is, inevitably, followed by the development  of full blown AIDS. The fact that HIV is commonly contracted through sexual  intercourse and anal penetration or addiction to drugs lends added reason for  disgust. There is a close parallel between the behaviour of the doctor faced  with a patient showing evidence of AIDS and that, till very recently, towards a  patient with leprosy.
				</p>
				<p>
					This illogical fear has made doctors lose  sight of some fundamental medical principles:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Contracting an infection from a patient is  the doctor's occupational hazard. The logical step towards avoiding such  infection is to take all the necessary precautions against transfer of  infection. It is not logical to treat the patient as an untouchable.
					</li>
					<li>
						HIV is a very fragile virus, vulnerable to  all the commonly adopted measures for sterilisation and disinfection.
					</li>
					<li>
						Transmission of HIV from patient to doctor  in the course of medical examination and treatment is rare.
					</li>
					<li>
						We are witness to individuals testing  positive to HIV and continuing to lead normal lives without ever showing any  trace of AIDS.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tests for HIV are, at times, known to yield  false positive results.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>A new class of  untouchables</h4>
				<p>
					For many patients, the ward of a public hospital is the last stopping place on  a dismal journey of stigmatisation. Patients with AIDS are driven from their  communities by fearful neighbours, pushed from one hospital to another by  doctors and staff members reluctant to treat them and, finally, approaching  death in the AIDS ward, left virtually to fend for themselves. AIDS patients  have become India's new untouchables to spend their lives being shunned. Like  caste untouchables, patients with AIDS are supposedly protected from discrimination  by laws, but statutes have counted for little. In 1994, a reporter for <em>The Statesman</em>chronicled the death of a 28 year old fruit  seller, Deepak Biswas, in a Calcutta hospital ward. <em>The  Statesman's</em> stories told how  Biswas had been left for days on sheets stained with blood and how food had  been pushed at him from a distance. After he died, weighing 60 pounds,  attendants left his body untouched for eight hours in the tropical heat.  Finally, the hospital superintendent helped a relative lift the body into a van  to be taken to the cremation ground. Later, neighbours pressed Biswas' family  to leave their home, saying they might infect the area. Biswas, typical of many  AIDS patients, had been shuttled through four hospitals before arriving at the  AIDS ward. At the School for Tropical Medicine, the main AIDS advisory centre  for the government of West Bengal, doctors told Biswas' relatives there was,  'no seat' for him. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burns John F: Virus begets wretched new class of untouchables.

				<p>
					They referred him to a doctor specialising in  India's traditional herbal medicine, telling the family that in a case of  incurable disease, 'we can use any drug or any measure'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other cases recounted by AIDS workers include  that of a patient in Madras who was being treated for fever. His doctor  informed his office that he had tested positive for HIV. When he returned to  work, he was kept out by the elevator operator and a door attendant. He went  home and took a near fatal drug overdose.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are also the cases of pregnant women  with HIV who have gone from doctor to doctor seeking somebody to deliver their  children. Here is a recent account of such practice. "A number of  obstetricians will not deliver a HIV patient who comes to their private nursing  home. They are afraid that if everybody comes to know that this is an HIV  infected patient, they will lose their practice. Secondly, they are afraid of  infecting their operation theatre, labour ward and all their staff including  themselves. So they would rather say 'No', because they are going to get the  same amount of money from her (as from other patients) and run the risk  themselves. So also surgeons with private nursing homes." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Merchant Rashid: A matter of life and strength. Humanscape 1996; 3 (13): 21-23" id="2">(2)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					A Calcutta haematologist, Dr. Asha Rao, tells  of a 27 year old who returned home with an HIV infection recently after years  of working in Bombay. As soon as his condition became known he lost his job in  a Calcutta tannery. His girlfriend left him, and his father forced him out of  the family home.

				<h4>Making the diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					We are witness to several unethical practices in checking for the presence of  infection by HIV in our patients:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Doctors and medical institutions refuse to  accept patients for investigation of therapy unless they undergo tests for  infection by HIV.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tests, ELISA, blot tests are ordered  without the patient's informed consent and with no attempt at explaining to the  patient or the family the implications of a positive result. These steps are  blatant violations of ethical norms. The General Medical Council of Great  Britain has, for instance, made a specific ruling: "The Council believes  that the principle (of consent to investigation) should apply generally, but  that it is particularly important in the case of testing for HIV infection, not  because the condition is of a different kind from other infections but because  of the possible serious social and financial consequences which may ensure for  the patient from the mere fact of having been tested for the condition. Only in  the most exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible for the prior  consent of the patient to be obtained, can testing without explicit consent be  justified." <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Medical Council: Statement on HIV infection and AIDS the ethical considerations.

					</li>
					<li>
						The patient showing a positive result on  the test is peremptorily dismissed. If admitted to hospital, he is instantly  discharged. In many instances, he is told that the reason for this dismissal is  the positive HIV report.
					</li>
					<li>
						No attempt is made to break the news  gently.
					</li>
					<li>
						No attempt is made to counsel the patient  and family, confirm the diagnosis by blot tests or other sophisticated means,  identify the route of infection and boost the patient's morale by telling him  that come what may, the doctor is by his side to help as best as he can.
					</li>
					<li>
						On the contrary, the doctor patient  relationship is usually terminated abruptly on receipt of the positive report.
					</li>
					<li>
						Citizens of Mumbai recall vividly the sixty  year old patient at the Bombay Hospital who, when told that he had to leave the  hospital as his test for HIV was positive, leaped to his death from its eighth  floor <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya Sunil K: The patient with AIDS.

				<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
				<h5>Respecting the patient's privacy</h5>
				<p>
					Once the diagnosis of HIV infection is made in a patient admitted to hospital  or nursing home, it is rapidly broadcast to all staff members. The change in  their attitude towards him is immediately obvious to the patient.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some clinics plaster difficult to miss  placards on the patient's bed informing all and sundry of the patient's HIV  status. This is especially tragic when the placard remains in place during the  hours when friends and relatives visit patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other clinics print in bold letters the HIV  status on the cover page of the patient's case notes, at times underlined in  red.
				</p>
				<p>
					When questioned, doctors and administrators  offer the explanation that this measure is taken in order to ensure that  everyone 'takes the necessary precautions when handling the patient'.
				</p>
				<h5>Informing the spouse</h5>
				<p>
					Since the spouse may contract the disease from her infected husband, how is she  to be informed of the very real danger she faces? A recent study makes the  consideration of this issue of vital significance.
				</p>
				<p>
					57% of individuals in rural South Africa would  not tell their wives about their having contracted sexually transmitted  disease. If infected by HIV, 66% would withhold information from their wives.  71% of men would not inform their casual partners about their HIV infection. The  same study showed that a majority of women claimed a right to know if a man is  infected. <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Seidel G, Ntuli N: HIV, confidentiality, gender and support in rural South Africa [letter]. The Lancet 1996; 347: 469." id="6">(6)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					There is every reason to believe that a  comparable study in India would show similar results. How is this problem  tackled in India? There are no clear guidelines on the subject issued by any  authoritative agency. Most doctors do not consider this a matter warranting  their interference. HIV infection has been diagnosed and the patient sent away.  There, for most, the matter ends.
				</p>
				<p>
					A few, concerned groups, notably at the  National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences, have evolved a  policy. They counsel each patient known to be infected by HIV, individually. At  the end of the session where the diagnosis is conveyed and advice offered on  available help and treatment; he is told of the possibility of passing on the  infection to his spouse. He is strongly advised to inform the spouse about his  HIV status and adopt the unfailing use of a condom during every sexual act.  During the next interview he is asked whether the wife has been informed. If  the answer is 'Yes', he is asked to bring the wife along during the next  interview for joint counselling. If the answer is 'No', without any acceptable  reason (such as the wife being out of station), he is once again asked to  inform the wife. This time he is also told that should he fail to do so, the  doctors at the centre will disclose the information to her. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravi V: Personal communication. 1995" id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					This practice has international sanction. As  noted by Bayer and Gostin, 'What is crucial is the underlying ethical principle  that confidentiality, while critical, is not the only ethical value. Indeed,  when vulnerable unsuspecting persons are placed at risk it may be imperative to  breach confidentiality. <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer Ronald, Gostin Lawrence : AIDS and ethics. In Jayasuriya DC. (Editor) HIV: Law, ethics and human rights. UNDP Regional Project on HIV and Development, New Delhi. 1995 p. 420." id="8">(8)</a> They refer to the case Tarasoff v. Regents of the University  of California in America in 1976, where a central legal doctrine emerged. Under  certain circumstances a clinician has an affirmative duty to warn or protect  unsuspecting targets of his patient's violent intentions. Several judges in  America have held it a duty of physicians to warn family members of the  presence of infectious diseases in an individual. "No case to date has  criticised a physician's disclosure to make limited, appropriate disclosures of  a patient's condition under circumstances in which the patient or others were  reasonably at risk but for the disclosure. The legal system appears to  encourage physicians to act responsibly by making more, rather then fewer,  disclosures of patient confidences under the general public policy that the greater  good is served despite intruding upon the patient's privacy." <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Labowitz Kenneth E: Beyond Tarasoff : AIDS and the obligation to breach confidentiality. Saint Louis University Public Law Review 1990; 9: 495-515." id="9">(9)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, in its guidelines, is very specific. 'Patients  who are HIV antibody positive should be instructed on how to inform their  partners and to refer them for counselling and testing. If they are unwilling  to notify their partners or if it cannot be assured that their partners will  seek counselling, physicians or health department personnel should use  confidential procedures to assure that the partners are notified.
				</p>

				<h5>Confidentiality in  recording and reporting test results</h5>
				<p>
					Public health requirements make it necessary for laboratories to maintain  records of positive HIV results. There is no difficulty as long as these  records remain confidential documents. Where reporting (to public health  authorities) is required by law, it is important to shield the identity of  infected individuals from exposure. <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bayer Ronald, Gostin Lawrence : AIDS and ethics.

				<h4>Law lags behind  ethical requirements</h4>
				<p>
					<em>"There is no statutory  provision regarding consent (in India) for testing. A combined application of  the doctrine of unconscionable contracts, Article 14 (Equality Clause) and  Article 21 of the Constitution (no person shall be deprived of his or her  liberty except by procedure established by law) may help in developing the  argument that consent has to be informed and supported by counselling services".</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"There is no specific statute providing for  confidentiality in India. Section 126 of the Evidence Act protects from  disclosure, professional communications between lawyers and their clients. No  such provision exists in the case of doctors."</em> <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Grover Anand: HIV/AIDS related law in India.

				<h4>Treatment of the  patient testing positive for HIV</h4>
				<p>
					Several centres avoid all problems concerning the treatment of such patients by  turning the patient away. <em>"Doctors in India have refused to treat HIV and  AIDS patients in some institutions including the All India Institute of Medical  Sciences, the premier public medical institute in India."</em> <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Labowitz Kenneth E: Beyond Tarasoff : AIDS and the obligation to breach confidentiality.

					Describing the situation, at the largest  public hospital in Madras, Chinai (1996) reports: Patients face discrimination  at every level from ward boy right upto the doctors. Surgeries (on them) are  constantly postponed. She cites the names of three patients, Kavita, Murugesha  and Rajeshwari, who were left outside the hospital gate and transported by the  (municipal) corporation lorry to the dumping ground. Having thrown patients out  of the hospital, nurses would write that the patients are absconding, when they  were not even fit to walk. "We are told to take such patients away, but  where do we take them?" asked the wife of one such patient. Poor patients,  especially women coming from rural areas, are subject to the worst forms of  humiliation and violation. <em>"We have gone to the police and the Tamil media  but none are willing to do anything about it,"</em> one member of the Positive Action Group said. <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chinai Rupa: Workshop on AIDS hit warns against Kerala based quack.The Times of India 15 August 1996 p.9." id="11">(11)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Another report describes similar treatment in  a hospital in Guwahati. Twenty one year old widow, Jahnabai Sharma, and her  daughter,Karishma, were seen at Guwahati Medical College after Jahnabai's  husband died of AIDS. They were then sent to the infectious diseases hospital.  Two weeks later they were discharged. The high court investigating this case  was told that if HIV infection was suspected, the patients were subjected to  tests and if found positive, were 'informally discharged'. In one case, a youth  was discharged in haste with the saline drip attached to him. He died a few  days later. An amount of Rs. 35,00,000 sanctioned by the Government of India to  the hospital for treating patients with AIDS was lying unutilised. <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Anonymous: HC summons officials for ill treating HIV patients. Indian Express 26 August 1996 p.5." id="12">(12)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Where the patient is not turned away, he is  made acutely conscious of the fact that he harbours an illness that is  terrifying. Attendants do their best not to make any physical contact  whatsoever. Sponging of the bed ridden patient is rarely carried out. When  contact is inevitable, the attendant dons gloves, cap, mask and gown. We have  witnessed doctors donning shielded goggles, plastic aprons and other  paraphernalia such that they appear ready for a voyage in outer space.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since doctors display fear and disgust, these  percolate down the line to the humblest attendant who now tosses the patient's  linen and hands his meal to him in such a manner that no contact is made. Snide  remarks implying certain knowledge of the means by which the patient acquired  the infection are made in the presence of the patient and his family.
				</p>
				<p>
					The person handling the patient's bed pan and  urinal does so almost under duress and with extreme disgust. When the patient  needs suction of the larynx and trachea, these are done with the face averted  to avoid infection by spray past the already formidable defences of goggles,  mask, cap and gown. Whilst no one denies the need to take care when handling  the patient's body fluids and when dealing with his person, should we rob the  patient of his dignity in doing so?
				</p>
				<p>
					I am often puzzled by those who are so  diligent in avoiding being infected by the patient. Wearing cap, mask, gown and  gloves they suck the patient's throat. They then stroll to the nurse's table  and plonk themselves on the chair. With the same pair of gloves on, they wipe  the sweat off their own foreheads, write notes on the case paper and then  replace the pen in an inner pocket. They then move on to the next patient known  to have a negative HIV test and minister unto him using the same gloves, cap,  mask and gown!
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to recall the American Medical  Association Code of 1847- an assertion that is representative of prevailing  international sentiment: <em>"And when pestilence prevails, it is their duty  (the duty of doctors) to face the danger and to continue their labours for the  alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives. (emphasis  added)."</em> <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Ravi V: Personal communication. 1995" id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					If contemporary confirmation is required,  consider the words of physician philosopher, Edmund Pellegrino: "To refuse  to care for AIDS patients, even if the danger were greater than it is, is to  abnegate what is essential to being a physician." <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pellegrino E: Altruism, self interest and medical ethics. Journal of the American Medical Association 1987; 258: 1939-1940." id="13">(13)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The General Medical Council of Great Britain  is equally unambiguous: <em>"It is unethical for a registered medical  practitioner to refuse treatment or investigation for which there are  appropriate facilities, on the ground that the patient suffers, or may suffer,  from a condition which could expose the doctor to a personal risk. It is equally  unethical for a doctor to withhold treatment from any patient on the basis of a  moral judgement that the patient's activities or lifestyle might have  contributed to the condition for which treatment was being sought. Unethical  behaviour of this kind might raise a question of serious professional  misconduct."</em> <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="General Medical Council: Statement on HIV infection and AIDS the ethical considerations.

				<h4>Taking advantage of  the diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					I know of examples where the patient testing positive for HIV has been charged  huge sums for therapy because everything that comes in contact with him during  the performance of tests or treatment has to be destroyed. I know of patients  who have been charged the full cost of metallic instruments used during surgery  when the instruments were carefully cleansed, sterilised and re-used on other  patients later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Patients with AIDS, attending a workshop in  Pune, expressed their agony over the dismal state of affairs in the public  hospitals in Madras. The encountered corruption, callousness and denial of  treatment in these institutions. Death certificates were not issued without the  payment of Rs. 500 as a bribe at the largest public hospital in Madras. <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chinai Rupa: Workshop on AIDS hit warns against Kerala based quack.The Times of India 15 August 1996 p.9." id="11">(11)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					When registered doctors refuse to treat  patients testing positive for HIV, quacks take advantage. A workshop in Pune in  August 1996 exposed the hollow claims of Majid, a Kerala based mining engineer  who made extravagant claims about an Ayurvedic potion he had concocted which  was said to cure AIDS. A brochure distributed by Majid claims that his drug has  the sanction of the Indian Council of Medical Research and the World Health  Organisation. People are selling their houses and mangalsutra to pay for  Majid's drug. Tests by the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore showed that  this drug contained corticosteroids. It is ironic that HIV patients had to warn  the media against publishing advertisements of his drug and exposed his  unfounded claims, the medical profession remaining blissfully unconcerned. <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goldenberg Suzanne: Focus/Indian AIDS Scandal : Doctor who preyed on desperation.

				<h4>Some frequently made  arguments and rebuttals</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<em>I must know whether or not a patient has AIDS. If I know that his test for HIV  is positive, I can take appropriate care to ensure that he does not pass his  infection on to others.</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						There can be no argument about the need for a  doctor to know all he can about his patient provided such knowledge is obtained  in the best interests of the patient. When information is sought merely for the  protection of the doctor, or, worse, to the detriment of the interests of the  patient (as when he is thrown out of the consulting room or hospital merely  because his HIV test is positive), the search for information becomes perverse,  unethical and immoral.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>I have a life to  lead and a family to look after. Why should I involve myself in treating a  patient with a fatal, communicable disease?</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						Such an attitude is born of ignorance and  prejudice. HIV is a fragile virus that is easily destroyed. Ordinary  precautions taken in the course of the management of any patient are more than  sufficient to ensure that the treating physician does not get infected. Despite  the hundreds of thousands of documented patients with HIV infection and AIDS  the world over, there are hardly any proven cases of doctors being infected by  the virus when the usual precautions were taken.
					</p>
					<li>
						<em>I have a right to  refuse to treat any patient. What is wrong if I refuse to treat a patient with  AIDS?</em>
					</li>
					<p>
						Refusal to treat on the basis of prejudice or  fear is not expected of the good doctor. The law does permit any doctor to  refuse to treat any patient provided such refusal is not likely to result in  irreversible harm or death. By using this provision of the law, the doctor will  be acting legally but it will be against all ethical and moral norms.
					</p>

				<h4>Some questions that  are never answered by doctors</h4>
				<p>
					Since you demand that each of your patients gets himself tested for infection  by HIV and shows you the result, is it not fair that you get yourself tested  for HIV as well and announce the results to each of your patients?
				</p>
				<p>
					What proof have you that patients can transmit  HIV to you? Can you provide references in the medical literature to such  transmission?
				</p>
				<p>
					Since you insist on wearing cap, mask,  goggles, gown and special protective shoes, could you provide references in the  literature to prove that these are effective in preventing transmission of HIV?
				</p>
				<p>
					When the literature shows that items used in  the care of the patient who tests positive for HIV are easily sterilised by  soaking them in bleach and then autoclaving them or sterilising them by  glutaraldehyde or ethylene oxide, why do you destroy them?
				</p>
				<p>
					Why do you charge patients testing positive  for HIV more than you would other patients? Where surgery is necessary, why do  you charge a patient with HIV more than you do another with diabetic gangrene  or peritonitis?
				</p>

				<h4>Public health strategy  on AIDS</h4>
				<h5>Prevention and treatment</h5>
				<p>
					Drugs effective  against the AIDS virus (such as AZT or zidovudine) are not freely available to  help those infected with HIV. Programmes in India largely consist of advising  people how AIDS is contracted, encouraging blood tests and handing out condoms.  This is especially regrettable as India is a signatory to the Paris AIDS Summit  Declaration (1 December 1994) which rightly states:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"Mindful that HIV/AIDS prevention and care and  support strategies are inseparable, and hence must be an integral component of  an effective and comprehensive approach to combating the pandemic, we declare  our obligation to act with compassion for and in solidarity with those with HIV  or at risk of becoming infected and undertake in our national policies to  protect and promote the rights of individuals, in particular those living with  or most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS through the legal and social environment."</em> <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Paris Aids Summit Declaration 1994: Annexure A in Jayasuriya DC.

				</p>
				<p>
					Special care centres for AIDS sufferers, or  hospices that might allow them to die with dignity, are virtually unknown. As a  result, for many AIDS sufferers, the miseries of death are compounded.
				</p>
				<p>
					The government's failure to set up effective  AIDS programmes means that much of the burden falls on private efforts. Those  attempting to stem the tide of infection by HIV battle against the taboos of a  society that discourages sexual candour, against ancient superstitions that  discourage the use of condom use and against indifference, sometimes even  hostility, from local officials.
				</p>
				<p>
					To take just one vulnerable group, the  seriousness of the AIDS problem among Indian truckers can be gauged from  discussions with them and their ride-along helpers. The drivers have an  average of 150 to 200 sexual encounters a year with women and with girls. <a class="reference" href="#sixteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Burns John F: Denial and taboo blind India to horror of its AIDS scourge.

						We have amidst us  girls and young women who have been lured or kidnapped from neighbouring  countries- Bangla Desh, Nepal, Myanmar. The manner in which we deal with them  once we find that they are infected by HIV needs serious reconsideration.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our current approach has elicited the  following comment from a citzen of Nepal on the internet: <em>"Acting on instructions  from the Bombay High Court, police on 5 February 1996 raided some of the city's  brothels. Four hundred and fifty six girls were rounded up, among them 218  Nepalese. Since there is no law against prostitution in India, it is customary  to deal with the problem by sending the sex workers back to their home regions,  once apprehended. This time, as a large number of Nepalese were also involved,  the Maharashtra government notified the Centre which in turn asked Nepal to  take in the Nepalese girls. But Kathmandu has been in no hurry to comply and  the impasse continues, even as two of the girls have died, presumably through  AIDS complications".</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"The Bombay High Court was well within its  rights when it ordered the police action under the Suppression of Immoral  Traffic of Women and Girls Act. But it was no moral indignation that motivated  the justices. What spurred them was the disclosure by a daily paper that up to  65 percent of Mumbai's prostitutes may be HIV positive. Their solution was  simple: send them back to where they came from. Case closed".</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>"Besides the questionable ethics of such a  move, how could the learned jurists be oblivious of the wider danger of sending  the hapless girls home? If the metropolis of Mumbai feels threatened by their  presence, what would be the repercussions on the rural areas from where a great  majority of these girls come? And how can it be proper that Mumbai (its men and  economy) takes maximum advantage of poor women driven to prostitution, and then  dumps them the moment they are seen as hazards? No one has bothered to ask that  question, least of all the Nepalese government."</em>

				<h4>Infected blood</h4>
				<p>
					A significant number  of commercial blood donors test HIV positive. Although government policy  requires hospitals and blood banks to test blood for HIV infection, surveys  show that at least 30 percent of all blood used is not tested, and that this  may account for as many as 12 percent of HIV infections.
				</p>
				<p>
					The medical profession has failed to take  action to prevent tainted blood from entering the blood banks. It was left to  social organisations such as Common Cause and the Courts to compel the  profession to act.
				</p>
				<p>
					In an attempt to ensure safer blood supply and  lessen malpractice, malfunctioning and corruption in our blood banking system,  the Supreme Court told the government to create a National Council for Blood  Transfusion. The judges advised the government to enact separate legislation  for .regulating the collection, processing, storage, distribution, and  transportation of blood and the operation of blood banks. The order also called  for all of India's blood banks to be licensed within a year. A quarter of them  were unlicensed when the order was passed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other provisions in the judicial order  included the ending of professional sale of blood within 2 years, verifying  that trained drug inspectors check the banks, and allowing 100 percent  exemption on income tax to people donating money to the banks. The court's  directive came in response to a petition filed by Common Cause.
				</p>
				<p>
					The court ruled a long while ago. We have yet  to see the ruling translated into practice.

				<h4>Infected semen</h4>
				<p>
					At the seminar on medical ethics organised by Max Mueller  Bhavan, New Delhi, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on 8 9  October 1995, a call for caution in the use of sperm supplied by private sperm  banks, which have mushroomed in many cities, was sounded. Dr. Lalita Badhwar, a  New Delhi gynaecologist, pointed out that most sperm banks did not test for  HIV. Since semen is one of the most potent means for transmitting the virus,  this lapse is blatant malpractice. During the discussion on this comment, Dr.  Indira Hinduja of Mumbai clarified that her hospital had totally stopped  artificial insemination because it was morally wrong to use untested donor  sperm.

				<h4>Grants for fighting  AIDS: how are they spent?</h4>
				<p>
					The Indian government has sent out conflicting messages. At times it has  described AIDS as a national crisis and at others treating it as a menace that  will go away. The government announced a $100 million five year AIDS programme  in 1992, with $85 million of the money in the form of a loan from the World  Bank. But as we near the end of the programme, only $35 million has been spent.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not just the authorities that are at  fault. Those claiming to work on AIDS are not blameless.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Western experts, much of the  money has gone on expensive conferences, planning sessions and reports. The  sums spent on programmes to improve blood screening, increase AIDS awareness,  promote condom use and create clinics have been pitifully meagre.

				<h4>Research on AIDS: one  unwelcome Indian example <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Goldenberg Suzanne: Focus/Indian AIDS Scandal : Doctor who preyed on desperation. The Guardian 9 December 1995, p 15." id="14">(14)</a></h4>
				<p>
					Desperation will lead people to do almost everything. This is a story about  what happened to 10 people in Mumbai when an American veterinarian came calling  with what he said was a miracle cure for AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					These ten, all HIV positive, became guinea  pigs in a secret test of an experimental vaccine whose effects, according to  international health experts, are still largely unknown. The vaccine based on  Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV) has never been tested on animals and most  scientists doubt whether it could offer any remedy to stricken humans.
				</p>
				<p>
					But ten middle class, educated people in  Bombay were persuaded BIV could save their lives. One of the patients who took  part in the trials recalled the vet's pitch: "He was saying the vaccine  has come and you are very lucky people. He said we will become HIV negative-  100% HIV negative. That's what he told us." After the trial was abandoned,  the patients were left with no medical support.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clandestine drug trials are unethical and  against the law. But it can take years and hundreds of millions of pounds to  carry out an authorised vaccine trial in the West and the American vet was in a  hurry to exploit his patent application.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bhairab Bhattacharya, aged 67, the Calcutta  born inventor and naturalised American who says he has a Ph. D. in veterinary  medicine, has spent several fruitless years trying to persuade the scientific  community of the merits of BIV.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bhattacharya was in correspondence with Dr. I.  S. Gilada. Dr. Gilada and a social worker, Maya Gogte, assembled a list of  trial participants. <em>"As such, our lives are useless,"</em> said one participant. <em>"If something could  come out for humanity, it is good. I have a scientific background and it  sounded logical."</em> Dr.  Bhattacharya delivered a brief lecture in English about the properties of BIV.  Participants were given no printed information about the vaccine and there was  no translation for those who spoke only Hindi or Marathi. They signed consent  forms, on which it was promised that the clinic would give them follow up  medical support.
				</p>
				<p>
					After they received the injection, Dr. Gilada  handed each participant an envelope containing Rs. 1000. According to the  sketchy notes taken by one of those who supervised the first injections, one of  the participants was already in the terminal phases of AIDS, was suffering ftom  diarrhoea and had a temperature of 104 degrees F. The man eventually died of  AIDS-related ailments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Bhattacharya made no attempt to secure  official permission for his experiment. The central government and health  authorities in Bombay and the state of Maharashtra say they were deliberately  kept in the dark. Dr. Bhattacharya argues that the search for a cure for AIDS  is too urgent for him to bother with formalities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trial was abandoned because of a dispute  (between Bhattacharya and Gilada) over money. By the time the second or booster  shot was administered on April 12, 1994, the experiment was effectively over. A  tenth man who could not be present at the clinic was so desperate to get his  shot that he borrowed money for the train fare to New Delhi to track down Dr.  Bhattacharya. He was shocked to find that they had not heard of him at the  addresses Dr. Bhattacharya was supposed to be available. Dr. Bhattacharya  travelled on to Calcutta where he says he injected four prostitutes who have  HIV with the vaccine and distributed milk infected with BIV to several other  women in the red light district.
				</p>
				<p>
					Raju, a designer aged 38, who took part in the  experiment said, <em>"They shouldn't have dumped us. They left us on the streets like  stray dogs. It was completely in human."</em>

				<h4>A draft code to be  adopted by all doctors</h4>
				<p>
					We need to evolve a code of conduct which must be wholeheartedly  subscribed to by all doctors. A draft code is offered. This could form the  basis for the evolution of a definitive document.
				</p>
				<p>
					We recognise the following truths:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a  virus capable of infecting humans.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is a fragile virus that is easily killed by  the standard techniques for sterilisation.
					</li>
					<li>
						It is commonly transmitted by one person to  another through homosexual or heterosexual intercourse, transfusion of infected  blood or blood products, or through unsterile hypodermic needles used for  injection into a person already infected by HIV.
					</li>
					<li>
						Such transmission of the virus can be avoided  by the use of simple measures such as the use of a condom during sexual  intercourse, screening of blood donors for HIV and the use of sterile  hypodermic needles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Infection by HIV produces a chronic,  manageable illness.
					</li>
					<li>
						We support the rights of infected patients to  be treated without prejudice in their workplace, home, and health care.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some individuals infected by HIV may go on to  develop Acquired Immuno deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
					</li>
					<li>
						At present we have no cure for AIDS. The  diagnosis of AIDS is, in most cases, tantamount to a death sentence.
					</li>
					<li>
						Patients with AIDS may suffer a host of  infectious diseases and suffer considerably before they die.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is considerable  prejudice in many minds against persons known to be infected by HIV or  suffering from AIDS. This augments the agony of such individuals.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					As aware and concerned physicians, we therefore  resolve:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						We are morally obliged and bound by duty to  provide the best possible treatment to patients known to harbour HIV or suffer  from AIDS, just as we would to any other patient entrusting himself or herself  to our care.
					</li>
					<li>
						Such care of patients known to harbour HIV or  suffering from AIDS, will be provided under the umbrella of ethical principles,  special care being taken to ensure confidentiality in view of the prevailing  general prejudice against such individuals.
					</li>
					<li>
						Patients will be offered counsel on the best  course of action to prevent transmission of infection to spouses, other sexual  partners and the population at large.
					</li>
					<li>
						Where the patient is seen to act  irresponsibly, we may find it necessary to intervene in the interest of the  spouse or the public at large.
					</li>
					<li>
						The function of the immune system improves  with proper diet, exercise, healthy living and can be assisted by therapeutic  means. We shall do all we can to reduce the possibility of inter current  infection and maintain a state of health in such patients.
					</li>
					<li>
						We shall discuss scientific knowledge on HIV  and AIDS at every forum at our command so as to inform the public, empower it  to take measures at preventing the spread of disease and ensure that those  infected by HIV have access to the best possible medical care.
					</li>
