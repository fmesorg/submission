				<h4>Medicine merchants</h4>
				<p>
					Few US doctors know that  their prescribing practices are available to pharmaceutical manufacturers for a  fee. Drug makers buy information from pharmacies, the government and the  American Medical Association to compile "prescriber profiles", to sway doctors'  prescribing habits. The AMA generates $20 million annually by selling  biographies of every American doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the $13.9 billion  that drug companies spent promoting their products last year, 87 percent was  aimed at the one million doctors, nurse practitioners and physicians'  assistants who can prescribe some medications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Marketers say they use  the reports to help determine which doctors should be offered certain perks.

				<h4>Cross-border trade</h4>
				<p>
					Patients undergoing  dialysis in Germany received a circular from an organisation based in the Czech  Republic offering kidney transplants without waiting lists from live donors. In  Germany, 12,000 of the 50,000 patients receiving dialysis are waiting for a transplant.  The Czech Republic does not yet have a law forbidding organ trade. Since 1997,  German law bans any trade in human organs or attempts to solicit trade.

				<h4>Just an error in paperwork</h4>
				<p>
					A 25-year-old woman admitted to the Sawai Man Singh Hospital, Jaipur, for the  removal of kidney stones ended up losing her uterus when her records were  confused with those of another patient with the same first name. When surgical  staff were asked why their preparations were so elaborate for relatively minor  surgery, they told the patient to shut up, and administered her anaesthesia.  The mix-up was noticed when the woman's husband read the patient slip after she  was brought out of the operating theatre.

				<h4>Pay up or else</h4>
				<p>
					A worker suffers a  stroke in the office and is rushed to a private charitable hospital but dies  shortly after. His relatives cannot claim his body till they paid up Rs 30,000,  borrowing from friends and neighbours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consumer activists say  managements resort to this tactic, harassing grief-stricken relatives to claim  their dues. Hospital authorities say this is a misunderstanding. "There  are emergency tests, despite which the patient dies. Relatives blame the  hospital for the death and refuse to pay." The judge of Mumbai's consumer  court says a consumer court has already ruled that there is nothing legally  wrong with the practice.

				<h4>Radiation overdoses</h4>
				<p>
					A study  by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre measured radiological doses for 12  different examinations in 40 hospitals in the country, and found wide  variations. Children received the same doses as adults, which sometimes meant  they got more than five times the necessary dose.

				<h4>Test new drugs on the  poor</h4>
				<p>
					The  US-based Discovery Laboratories had planned a placebo-controlled study in Latin  America of sinapultide, a new drug for treating idiopathic respiratory distress  syndrome in premature newborn infants. A control group of 325 babies would have  received a placebo instead of available surfactants, as a result of which many  would have died unnecessarily.
				</p>
				<p>
					The trial would have the Helsinki Declaration,  which requires that new treatments be tested against the best current method.
				</p>
				<p>
					The company's Dr R Capetola said the study planned three arms: sinapultide, an  already-approved surfactant drug (beractant), and a placebo. Alternative trial  designs were rejected as likely to increase the length of the study, resulting  in thousands of additional deaths and debilitating lung conditions among  infants. Following public protest, the trial was modified to include an active  control.

				<h4>How did she get that  idea?</h4>
				<p>
					A  50-year-old woman in Puri, Orissa, wrote to the prime minister and the National  Human Rights Commission saying she is ready to sell one of her kidneys to save  her husband who is suffering from cancer. Mustari Biwi begs every day to  provide a meal for her family. Affected by the cyclone last year, she received  no relief. "I wrote to the chief minister and district commissioner  seeking financial help but got no responses, so I decided to sell my kidney and  arrange the money," she said.

				<h4>A rap on the knuckles</h4>
				<p>
					The  Maharashtra Medical Council Act of 1965 gives the council powers to deregister  doctors found guilty of negligence or malpractice. Of the 162 cases registered  against doctors till date, no doctors have been deregistered. A few have been  suspended, and a number are being heard at present.

				<h4>Innovative solutions</h4>
				<p>
					One  year ago, municipal hospitals in Mumbai raised fees for registration and for  minor tests, and imposed new charges for various surgical procedures - as well  as for delivery of a third child. The result: a discernible drop in the  number of patients attending the out-patient department as well as for  in-patient treatment. Some patients slip away before they get discharged.  Instead of seeing this as a symptom of people's desperation, some hospitals  plan to deal with the problem by advancing the time of check-out so it doesn't  coincide with visiting hours.

				<h4>Slow and steady</h4>
				<p>
					On  February 13, six people who underwent cataract surgery at the KJ Somaiya  Hospital in Mumbai lost their eyesight after contracting an infection. A state  government inquiry found infection prevention practices, and records,  inadequate. A senior opthalmologist states that quick action could have saved  some people's sight, but the hospital did not have the facilities, nor did it  refer the patients elsewhere. At a press conference on March 21, the hospital's  dean insisted that the infection must have come "from some extraneous  source", but that the management was considering giving compensation to those  who lost their vision.
