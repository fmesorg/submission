					The decision of the actress, Angelina Jolie (AJ), to undergo
					preventive risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy has elicited
					extreme responses, in support and against. We will discuss
					whether her decision was justified and if there are other
					options available to women. AJ, who is 38 years old, inherited
					the BRCA 1 gene. Because of the lack of randomised trials,
					there is controversy about the overall benefit that various
					risk-reduction strategies offer carriers of the BRCA 1, but some
					of the strategies offer a clear benefit. The decision to opt for
					mastectomy must be driven by the patient's choice, evidence
					on the balance of the risks and benefits, the quality of life after
					surgery and issues relating to body image.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is undoubtedly a level of risk associated with being
					a carrier of the BRCA 1 gene. The facts regarding the risk
					must be presented to patients in such a way that it enables
					them to make an informed choice. The Breast Cancer Linkage
					Consortium has estimated the lifetime risk of the development
					of breast cancer among BRCA 1 carriers as 19% at 40 years of
					age and 85% by the age of 70 years, though the relative risk
					of developing breast cancer goes down with advancing age

					families from which they are drawn had to have at least four
					cases of breast cancer at ages of below 60 years to be included.
					A study which is more representative of the general population
					has estimated the lifetime cumulative risk of the development
					of breast cancer among carriers of the BRCA 1 mutation to be
					46% and 59% at the ages of 70 and 80 years, respectively <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Satagopan JM, Offit K, Foulkes W, Robson ME, Wacholder S, Eng CM, Karp SE, Begg CB.

					These estimates of risk combine the effects of age and genetic
					predisposition, as the contribution of genetic risk is reduced
					with increasing age.

					A prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (PBM), which is what
					AJ underwent, is not a foolproof option and there are other
					less drastic measures available. Some of these are increased

					examination, mammograms and MRI scans) <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sardanelli F, Podo F, Santoro F, Manoukian S, Bergonzi S, Trecate G, Vergnaghi D, Federico M, Cortesi L, Corcione S, Morassut S, Di Maggio C, Cilotti A, Martincich L, Calabrese M, Zuiani C, Preda L, Bonanni B, Carbonaro LA, Contegiacomo A, Panizza P, Di Cesare E, Savarese A, Crecco M, Turchetti D, Tonutti M, Belli P, Maschio AD, High Breast Cancer Risk Italian 1 (HIBCRIT-1) Study.

					breast cancer by about 50%. The downside of PBM followed
					by reconstruction is that it is a highly specialised, complex
					procedure which involves a long recovery period, pain, risk of
					infection and changes in skin sensations. It is also irreversible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Given the facts available, was the decision justified? The
					decision is a very personal one and was possibly driven by
					strong psychological and emotional factors. Women who opt
					for such a strong measure find it difficult to overcome their fear
					and anxiety with regard to the disease. Breast cancer patients
					experience fear following the diagnosis of cancer, and also fear
					disfigurement, recurrence, suffering, death, and the possibility
					their children contracting breast cancer, but they learn to live
					with it, fight it and overcome it. AJ willingly and knowingly
					took the very action that causes the same physical and mental
					trauma that a diagnosis of breast cancer brings. Prevention and
					cure both have to be weighed against the price to be paid. It is
					important to balance the benefits against the financial, physical
					and psychological damage. Often, one even forgoes the cure
					because the damage is greater than the benefit. AJ may have
					beaten the odds for breast cancer, but may yet succumb to
					some other event.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sweeping generic statements on "taking action" in case of
					susceptibility to cancer may promote fear and confusion,
					and possibly direct women to overestimate their risk and opt
					for overtreatment. Those who choose AJ as their role model
					may be especially inclined to adopt such a course. By virtue
					of the fact that AJ is a celebrity, any choice she makes is open
					to debate and discussion, but she is in no way responsible
					or accountable for this. However, when she chooses to
					champion a personal choice on a public platform, she must
					be accountable and open to questioning. Women who do not
					have the requisite knowledge, financial wherewithal or the
					same access to medical expertise, or even those who do not fall
					in the same risk group, may blindly follow AJ's example, without
					being totally aware of the pitfalls associated with it.
				</p>
				<p>
					One may argue that AJ has the right to take her own decision
					since it is her body and her life. What is objectionable is the
					glorification of the whole affair. She has been aided and
					abetted by the media, which has put her on a pedestal and
					implied that this is the way to prevent breast cancer, thus
					devaluing at one go all the efforts to promote early detection
					through inexpensive and non-invasive methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					When personal choices are acclaimed and gain popularity and
					recognition, they need to be assessed in terms of how valuable
					they are to others and whether they can be replicated to suit
					most people. Awareness thus created, if not supported by
					reality, can have dangerous implications for the lives of many
					who may fall prey to such influences and act accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Caution needs to be exercised while raising issues that may
					cause fear and confusion, which, in turn, lead to an undesirable
					eagerness to adopt certain medical practices in situations
					that do not warrant them. Awareness and treatment need
					not be synonymous with over-awareness (anxiety) and overtreatment.
				</p>
				<p>
					All in all, we believe that AJ's choice was too drastic, but it is
					a matter of ethical duty to present the option to patients so
					that they can weigh the pros and cons and make an informed
					decision about not opting for less invasive and effective
					strategies.
