				<h4>The concept of brain death</h4>
				<p>
					In ancient times, before  the realisation of the importance of the action of the heart and circulation of  blood, a person was deemed to have died when he stopped breathing. The  reflecting surface of a mirror was held before the face of the sick person.  Death was diagnosed when the mirror was not fogged by water vapour present in  the breath. Later, irreversible cessation of respiration and of the action of  the heart were established as the criteria for the diagnosis of death. In the  middle of this century, attention was turned to the brain, which required much  more energy than other organs. If its needs were not met for four minutes or  more, irreversible damage to it followed. After a variable interval, the other  organs failed and the person died. In the interim, there was a dead brain in a  dying body.
				</p>
				<p>
					The term 'brain death'  was introduced in 1965 during a report of renal transplantation from a heart-beating,  seemingly brain-dead donor. Following the path-breaking paper by the ad hoc  committee of the Harvard Medical School and international debate on it, the  concept of 'brain death' gained general acceptance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development of the  science of organ transplantation and the availability of drugs that prevented  rejection of transplanted organs by the recipient's body made the concept of  brain death attractive. Given that once the brain is dead, death of the rest of  the person within hours or days is inevitable, should we not use organs from  this person to save other lives? International debates were followed by  acceptance of this proposition. This has enabled transplant units save  innumerable lives that would otherwise have been lost.
				</p>

				<h4>The law in India</h4>
				<p>
					Unlike the United States  of America, India follows the British lead and has chosen irreversible damage  of the brain-stem as being diagnostic of death. The Transplantation of Human  Organs Act, 1994 (Central Act 42 of 1994), lays down the definition of death  thus: 'Deceased person' means a person in whom permanent disappearance of  all evidence of life occurs, by reason of brain-stem death or in a  cardio-pulmonary sense at any time after live birth has taken place. It goes on  to state that 'brain-stem death' means the stage at which all functions of the  brain stem have permanently and irreversibly ceased.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once brain-stem death  has been diagnosed by an authorised committee using specified criteria, the  dead person's organs can be removed for transplantation provided legally valid  consent for this is available.
				</p>

				<h4>Stopping treatment after brain death</h4>
				<p>
					Traditionally, once  there is permanent cessation of breathing and the action of the heart, all  treatment is stopped. Under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, it  stands to reason that once brain death has been diagnosed, there is nothing to  be gained by continuing any treatment. The only rational reason for continuing  treatment after the diagnosis of brain death &ndash; use of the ventilator, drugs to  prop up the blood pressure, antibiotics and intravenous fluids &ndash; is to provide  time for the transplant teams to get their patients in and ready themselves for  the operations to remove organs from the dead to the living.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, as Mr Bumble  observed in Dickens' Oliver Twist, at times 'the law is an ass, an idiot'.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Our present dilemma</h4>
				<p>
					Should we stop all care  once the patient is brain dead?
				</p>
				<p>
					As Lance Stell points  out, to many laypersons (and to some medical professionals too, unfortunately),  the term 'brain death' suggests that there is more than one kind of death  ('brain death' and 'cardio-respiratory death'), or that there is more than one  way to be dead (in a brain-sort-of-way and in a heart-sort-of-way), or that  there are degrees of being dead ('brain-dead' and 'really dead' or  'dead-dead'), or that one might die more than once (first, when one's brain  dies and again later when one's heart stops).
				</p>
				<p>
					He narrates an  experience that most of us have also encountered again and again.  "Recently, I consulted on a case in which an ICU patient's attending  physician, an experienced nephrologist, said the following to her patient's  family: 'I am sorry to tell you that your daughter is brain dead. I will keep  her on life-support for a while longer, I will even order her dialysed again,  if you wish...at least until you decide what you want to do.' Not surprisingly,  the patient's father asked, 'What are her chances of recovery, doctor?'
				</p>
				<p>
					"Needless  misunderstanding had complicated a tragedy. Since the patient had been  diagnosed 'dead' by medically accepted neurological criteria, it was no longer  appropriate to refer to the medical equipment attached to her as 'life  support.' Nor should the attending physician have offered dialysis. After  several hours, the confusion was resolved. All interventions were withdrawn.  The patient was pronounced dead (when her heart stopped!)." This dilemma  stems from three deficiencies in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act:
				</p>
				<p>
					Our legislators  erroneously included the definition of brain death in an act intended to  regulate organ transplantation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst defining brain  death, they specified 'by reason of brain-stem death or in a cardio-pulmonary  sense' thus leaving ambiguity in many minds. It has not been specified that  'brain death' equals 'death' for all purposes. As noted above, it stands to  reason that if I can remove heart, lungs, liver and kidneys from a brain dead  person for transplantation into other living individuals, I should also stop  all medical care if such a person is not a candidate for the donation of organs  for any reason whatsoever. I find hospital administrators unwilling to permit  such a step. They continue to hold fast to the old 'cardio-pulmonary' criterion  for the diagnosis of death when the brain dead person is not a candidate for  donating organs.
				</p>
				<p>
					This has several harmful  consequences. The agony of relations is prolonged for days, weeks or even  up to six months till the heart finally comes to a permanent halt and the  oscilloscope shows a continuous flat line instead of the P-Q-R-S-T squiggles.  In many instances, the family undergoes the severely traumatic experience of  seeking opinion after opinion from several consultants in the hope that someone  will tell them that further treatment is likely to prove fruitful. The family  continues to pay huge sums of money for 'intensive care' of a dead person. A  bed in the intensive care unit is locked up by a dead person. Finally, doctors  and nurses carry out the charade of caring for a person who is dead and spend  time on the corpse that could be spent more fruitfully on other salvageable  patients.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Some ways out under the present law</h4>
				<p>
					Dr M K Mani, senior  nephrologist at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, has a clearly laid down policy.  Once a person is deemed to be brain dead, the relatives are called in and the  diagnosis and its implications are clearly explained to them. After confirming  that they have understood what has been told, they are asked to decide on the  further course of action &ndash; donation of organs or stoppage of all treatment.  Should they opt for the latter, the legal next-of-kin are requested to put this  decision down on the case paper and sign the document. All treatment is now  discontinued and the body is handed over to them. If, however, the family  chooses to continue care in the intensive care unit till breathing and the  action of the heart come to a permanent halt, this is honoured.
				</p>
				<p>
					A senior consultant in  Pune informed delegates attending the annual conference of this Society in that  city some time ago that he proceeds along the same lines as Dr Mani but takes  the additional step of asking the relatives to switch off the ventilator and  stop the intravenous fluids. These are unsatisfactory measures in that they do  not have the clear sanction of the law. Mr. Bumble's observation and the law  enunciated by U S Air Force Captain Edward A Murphy Jr ('If anything can  go wrong, it will.') may yet lead to the prosecution of a doctor by misguided  relatives of a brain dead person. We have been assured by senior judges sitting  on the bench and senior lawyers practising at the Supreme Court that should  such a case be brought before a court, it will, almost certainly, be dismissed.  Even so, the dread of seeing one's name in bold headlines &ndash; 'Doctor ABC accused  of killing patient' &ndash; haunts many minds. Courts are heavily burdened and  judgements often delayed by years. The appearance of the line &ndash; 'Doctor ABC  found not guilty of murder' &ndash; as a footnote at the bottom of an obscure column  years after the event will prove small compensation for the agony suffered by  the doctor and his family.
				</p>

				<h4>The permanent solution to this sorry situation</h4>
				<p>
					We need a separate Act  specifying the new definition of death. This Act should provide details of  neurological criteria for death to be used in making the diagnosis. The Act  must state clearly that this definition supersedes the older definition of  death 'in a cardio-pulmonary sense'. Once diagnosis of death is made under the  new definition, the patient is, for all intents and purposes, dead. The Indian  Society of Critical Care is ideally placed in bringing about this much-needed  change in our law.
