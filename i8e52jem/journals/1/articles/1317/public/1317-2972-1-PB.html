				<h4>Cadaver transplantation</h4>
				<p>
					It has  been correctly pointed out by Harsha Deshmukh inher article Cadaver  transplants: ground realities <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Deshmukh Harsha: cadaver transplant: ground realities. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 53." id="1">(1)</a> that very few cadaver transplants have been  performed even after the Human Organs Act 1994 removed a major legal hurdle by  recognising brain death.
				</p>
				<p>
					As suggested by Ms  Deshmukh, a central body with a transparent protocol for putting patients on a  waiting list and distributing organs would work wonders if help is taken from  the information technology drive sweeping the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this respect I  would like to refer the readers of <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em> to a report by  R.V. Petrov in <em>Me or not me,</em> a book on immunology, in which countries  cooperate and use computer technology to save lives <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Petrov R P: Me or not me. Mir Publishers, Moscow, 1987." id="2">(2)</a>. The selection of the  donor-recipient pair is accomplished not by choosing a donor for a recipient  but by selecting a recipient for a donor.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Van Rood, an  immunologist from the Dutch city of Leiden, describes the functioning of the  international organisation Eurotransplant: Data on patients in need of a renal  graft, their leucocyte and blood groups and other relevant information, are  stored in a computer. Every month printouts listing recipients according to  their blood cell groups are sent to centres affiliated with Eurotransplant. If  one of the centres has a potential donor, it telephones the closest most  suitable recipient. The doctor in charge of the donor contacts the doctor  supervising the patient. Sixty-seven patients have already obtained kidneys  through Eurotransplant's card indices. The organs to be grafted were on an  average two to five times more suitable than those chosen by other means.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course it is  difficult to find a kidney, to say nothing of a heart. But a patch of skin to  cover a burnt surface, bone marrow for treating radiation sickness, or blood,  can be supplied by virtually any healthy person. In these cases success is  based on overall typing. Many countries have started typing antigens vis-a-vis  compatibility among large groups of people. In the not so distant future,  passports will carry, in addition to blood group and Rh sensitivity,  information on the four basic tissue compatibility antigens.
				</p>
				<p>
					To treat radiation  sickness by means of bone marrow transplantation, Professor Good from  Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, uses a card index containing data of  20,000 typed donors. Radiation sickness develops because leukaemia or blood cancer  can be treated only by irradiating a patient with X- or Gamma rays. It can be  cured only by grafting bone marrow compatible in all known antigens. This  requires screening several thousand donors to find a compatible one. However,  bone marrow transplantation does away with the need to suppress immunological  responses with medicines toxic to the entire body.
				</p>
				<p>
					But what is to be  done for heart transplantation? A compatible donor for this cannot be found  even through Eurotransplant. A heart for transplantation can be taken only from  a patient who is dying in a most sophisticated equipped hospital, dying, for  instance, of a cranial-cerebral trauma: the brain is already dead, while  breathing and heart beat are sustained artificially. Transplantation should be effected  immediately. To get a donor under these circumstances is an extremely rare  event.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Petrov's article  was published in 1987. Much has developed in the field of medical technology  since then. In order to tackle a medical problem such as cadaver transplantation,  such approaches could be the subject of serious debate. There is scope for  getting the data required for kidney transplantation centrally located and made  available to needy patients in spite of our social and political problems.
