				<h5>The Hastings Center</h5>
				<p>
					I will take the liberty of putting you on the complimentary mailing list to receive our major publications, the Hastings Center Report and IRB. We hope you find them useful. Second, we will be sending you a collection of back issues of the Hastings Center Report which will give you access to a great many articles of interest in the field of medical ethics. Third, we are including a few other items as well. From time to time we will see if we can send you material.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are most pleased to hear of your interest in biomedical ethics.
