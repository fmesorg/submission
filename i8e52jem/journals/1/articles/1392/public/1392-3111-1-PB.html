					Diabetes is the second  most common chronic disease in childhood (the first being asthma). It is a  disease for which there is no cure as of today. Diabetes in children is usually  of the insulin dependent variety. The condition poses a major challenge to diabetic  children and to their families.
				</p>
				<p>
					Diabetic children must take insulin injections at least two times a day, check  their blood glucose regularly at home and observe several restrictions in diet  and physical activity. They must make major adjustments in their lifestyle, as  must other members of their families. Misconceptions about this disease are  rampant &mdash; even among school and college authorities &mdash; and come in the way of  the child leading a normal life. Further, the cost of managing diabetes is  quite prohibitive. Unfortunately insurance companies in India do not cover this  chronic ailment.
				</p>

				<h4>Need for awareness</h4>
				<p>
					Though the symptoms of diabetes are very typical, the diagnosis is often missed  at an early stage because of a lack of awareness. Diabetes in children is often  misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection, asthma, worms, encephalitis and  appendicitis. Delay in diagnosis can prove to be fatal. Awareness must be  created among the lay public and among family physicians that diabetes can  occur in childhood, infancy and even the newborn period. They must also be  informed of the clinical clues to this diagnosis.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					Many diagnostic tests are only of academic interest. In a child who has the  typical symptoms, the diagnosis can be confirmed by a simple random blood  glucose estimation and urine acetone test. An oral glucose tolerance test is  unnecessary except in very early cases that are asymptomatic or have vague  symptoms. Baseline serum lipids, TSH, anti-thyroid antibodies, urine routine  and culture and fundus examination are essential in all cases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other special and expensive tests (HLA typing, Islet cell antibodies, anti-GAD  antibodies, insulin autoantibodies, viral studies) are often asked for but do  not change the management or prognosis in a given case. They should be  performed only for academic interest in a research setting or in the occasional  case where it is suspected the diabetes may not be of the type 1 variety.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>After diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					Acceptance of the diagnosis by the patient is the first essential step  in successful management. In the initial stages following diagnosis, all  patients are tempted to reject the diagnosis or the treatment (insulin  therapy), or both. Misleading newspaper reports and unscrupulous quacks add to  the problem by suggesting or offering alternatives to insulin therapy. We have  seen many patients omitting insulin and switching over to homoeopathy or  ayurveda only to return in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis. One patient from a  highly educated family repeated this near fatal mistake thrice before finally  falling in line. In our experience the best way to tackle this problem is to  get senior patients to counsel newly diagnosed cases, based on their own early  experiences and misadventures.
				</p>
				<p>
					Good diabetes control rests on four pillars &mdash; insulin therapy, meal planning,  regular planned exercise and therapeutic monitoring. These pillars have to be  supported by a foundation made up of patient education and emotional stability.  If this foundation is weak, the entire edifice will collapse.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctor's role in management of this disease does not end with providing a  prescription. S/he must educate the patient in self management and ensure  emotional stability. This process requires a dedicated team a comprising  paediatric diabetologist, a psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, a dietitian,  a patient educator and a social worker.
				</p>
				<p>
					Diabetic children and their parents/guardians must be educated in all aspects  of diabetes self care (see table 2) so as to make them independent, give them a  sense of control over their disability, help them achieve better diabetes  control and cut down the cost of treatment. Patient education can be achieved  by means of formal lectures and demonstrations or with the help of educational  games, diabetes quiz contests and so on. At the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation  clinic we have a fully trained patient educator in attendance. We also hold  monthly meetings during which patient education is imparted. Once a year during  the Christmas vacation we conduct a four-day residential camp at Khandala  where the stress is on patient education and informal psychotherapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Informal psychotherapy must be given to help the patient overcome the initial  shock at diagnosis, the "why me?" feeling, the sense of guilt and feeling of  hopelessness. This is also the best response to false hopes, anxieties about  the future, any inferiority complex, and financial worries.

				<h4>When to suspect diabetes in a child:</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						classical symptoms: polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia with weakness and weight loss,
					</li>
					<li>
						loss of weight despite excessive
						appetite,
					</li>
					<li>
						secondary enuresis,
					</li>
					<li>
						observation of ants collecting around the urine,
					</li>
					<li>
						respiratory distress without any positive findings in the respiratory or cardiovascular systems,
					</li>
					<li>
						in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, and
					</li>
					<li>
						in the differential diagnosis of
						coma.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Conventional or intensive therapy?</h4>
				<p>
					In conventional therapy patients take two shots of insulin daily, check their  blood glucose once or twice a day and adjust insulin doses every 3-5 days  based on the patterns of blood glucose.
				</p>
				<p>
					In intensive therapy patients either use an insulin pump or take three or more  shots of insulin daily and check their blood glucose 4-5 times a day. Besides  pattern adjustment algorithms they also take insulin supplements whenever  dictated by the prevailing blood glucose or anticipated change in meal  size / physical activity.
				</p>
				<p>
					Intensive therapy, though proven to reduce the risk of micro-vascular  complications of diabetes, should be recommended very selectively, only to  highly motivated and intelligent teenagers. Further, intensified treatment can  only be recommended by those centres which have the facility for 24-hour  patient back-up service on phone.
				</p>

				<h4>Bringing down costs</h4>
				<p>
					All diabetes-related paraphernalia are available in India, but at a price.  While they do cost much less than the same products in developed countries,  they pose a financial burden even for well off patients. For a 30-kg child,  the monthly cost of insulin works out to Rs 450. Blood glucose monitoring once  or twice a day will cost another Rs 600, and even if each syringe is used for  seven days, it would cost Rs 25. The necessary laboratory tests would cost an  average of Rs 200 a month.
				</p>
				<p>
					Insurance companies in  our country do not cover this chronic childhood disease. The JDF helps out all  poor patients by supplying these requirements free of cost or at highly  subsidised rates, and expensive monitoring equipment can be lent by the JDF  centre for needy patients.
				</p>

				<h4>Problems at school</h4>
				<p>
					Schools are reluctant to accept diabetic children. When a diabetic  child joins school, the school authorities must be informed of the fact, and  educated about the condition. They must be told that diabetes is not  contagious, that it will not interfere with the child's academic progress and  that the child can and should participate in all sports activities. At the same  time, the child's teachers must be educated in early recognition and first-aid  management of hypoglycaemia. They must be asked to give the child time off to  take his/her shots, test blood glucose levels, or take a snack whenever  necessary. They should have the contact number of the child's doctor / clinic  in case of emergency.
				</p>

				<div class="box">
					<h4>What patients should know</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The implications of being a diabetic,
						</li>
						<li>
							four procedures (insulin administration, home blood glucose testing, urine acetone testing, and glucagon administration),
						</li>
						<li>
							the prevention, early identification and first aid management of the diabetes-related emergencies hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis,
						</li>
						<li>
							meal planning, and
						</li>
						<li>
							record keeping and insulin dose adjustments.
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h4>The dangers of secrecy</h4>
				<p>
					Secrecy must be discouraged as it can prove to be dangerous for various  reasons. When the condition is kept hidden, the child will not have the freedom  to eat, to test blood or to inject insulin when required. Further, if the child  suddenly develops hypoglycaemia, the teachers and friends will not be in a  position to help. Diabetic children must carry a diabetic identification card  on their person so that they receive appropriate treatment if they develop a  seizure or aberrant behaviour due to hypoglycaemia in public places. Secrecy in  marriage can also be dangerous and detrimental to marital harmony. Many of our  patients have found very good life partners despite disclosing in advance that  they suffer from insulin-dependent diabetes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Marriage and reproduction</h4>
				<p>
					Juvenile diabetics can marry and lead successful married lives. The risk of the  offspring developing diabetes is small: two per cent if the mother is a  diabetic, six per cent if the father is the patient, and 30 per cent if both  parents are juvenile diabetics. A diabetic woman will need to control her blood  sugars very well even before conception to reduce the possibility of congenital  malformations in her offspring. Tight control throughout pregnancy is a must so  that the neonate is spared the possibility of birth trauma, respiratory  distress syndrome or metabolic problems particularly hypoglycaemia,  hypocalcemia, polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Prevention</h4>
				<p>
					For family members of diabetic children, certain tests (including HLA  typing, islet cell antibodies, insulin auto antibodies, anti-GAD antibodies,  and first phase insulin release on intravenous glucose tolerance test) can  serve as a guide to the subsequent development of diabetes. However, these  tests are not fool-proof. Further, since there is no proven measure to prevent  the development of diabetes, these tests are best avoided except in a research  setting, as they would only add to the level of stress without any positive  gain.
