				<h4>Arthralgia in a villager</h4>
				<p>
					Arthralgia in a villager,
					<br />
					Who believes in private health care,
					<br />
					Pledges belongings
					<br />
					Under family pressure and own
					<br />
					enthusiasm.
				</p>

				<p>
					Moves to urban environ,
					<br />
					And searches for specialists,
					<br />
					Who order tests after tests
					<br />
					And set off a cascade of effects.
					<br />
					A vicious cycle of diagnostics,
					<br />
					Therapy and referrals,
					<br />
					Galloping treatment costs
					<br />
					And exhausted financial resources,
				</p>

				<p>
					Obvious exploitation
					<br />
					Enforces return to village,
					<br />
					With sheaves of radiographs
					<br />
					And bundles of laboratory reports.
				</p>

				<p>
					The fat folder
					<br />
					And even more obese file,
					<br />
					Merely confirm
					<br />
					Simple arthralgia!
				</p>

				<p>
					Finds comfort in aspirin
					<br />
					And the ministrations
					<br />
					Of his own primary health centre doctor,
					<br />
					Amidst his family and near ones.
