				<h4>Jack Bauer, the man who made torture popular</h4>
				<p>
					During the United States presidential debate, one of the questions that candidates were asked was: "Is torture justified?" The response that received the greatest support was: "I'd be looking for Jack Bauer at that time, let me tell you."
				</p>
				<p>
					Jack Bauer is an immensely popular television character who regularly relies on his own version of "enhanced interrogation", which is essentially a more palatable label for torture. Thanks to his prime-time presence on national television, roughing
					up prisoners in a weekly struggle to protect the country, polls shows that American acceptance of torture increased from 36% in 2006 to 44% in 2008.
				</p>
				<p>
					Somewhere in the midst of war, terror and politics, the idea of torture has become acceptable. Apologists for torture argue that it increases the amount of information extracted from socalled high-value detainees. The reality however, is that torture simply does not work. Analyses of interrogations have shown torture to be ineffective. On the contrary, a former interrogator states that torture "played right into the hands of those who were determined not to give away anything of military
					importance". The use of force yields unreliable results and can force the person being tortured to say whatever he thinks
					the interrogator wants to hear. It is commonly assumed that inflicting pain can "facilitate compliance" with the interrogator's demands, but there is no scientific research to suggest that coercion can provide accurate and useful information. In a state of extreme urgency or importance, a nation would be ill-served to turn to the least reliable method of interrogation.

				<h4>Transitioning to universal healthcare coverage in
				Thailand</h4>
				<p>
					In 2001, Thailand's healthcare system moved towards implementing the Universal Coverage (UC) policy. This study measured household out-of-pocket healthcare payments using socioeconomic surveys, pre- (2000) and post-UC (2002, 2004).The proportion of out-of-pocket healthcare payments as a share of household living expenses among households, including catastrophic healthcare payments, declined once universal coverage was implemented. The figures on catastrophic payments indicated that the poorest incurred lower catastrophic payments compared to the better off. The UC policy also seems to work in preventing impoverishment due to out-of-pocket healthcare payments. The authors conclude that the UC policy is a valuable social protection and safety net strategy that contributes to prevention of financial catastrophe and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket healthcare payments, enabling Thailand to achieve equitable
					healthcare financing.

				<h4> The future of primary care in the US </h4>
				<p>
					An analysis of primary care in the US argues that it will decline
					over the next decade. The main reason is that medicine is
					losing state sponsorship and is simultaneously become more
					attractive for private interests. Additional reasons include: (1)
					the epidemiologic transition resulting in the dominance of
					chronic diseases, reducing doctors to providing palliative care
					and monitoring incurable conditions; (2) the growth of nonphysician
					clinicians; (3) clinical guidelines that have reduced
					doctoring to formulaic tasks easily performed by non-physician
					clinicians;(4) the shift in focus from physical examinations
					to impersonal diagnostic tests; (5) the field of primary care
					medicine becoming unattractive, evident in the decline of
					applications by US graduates to such programmes, and (6) the
					growth of internet access and direct to consumer advertising
					that could result in everyday illnesses being self-managed or
					managed by non-physician clinicians working out of retail
					clinics.Physicians will no longer need to be the middlemen
					between patients and specialists.
				</p>
				<p>
					A commentator on this analysis presents a case for the
					resilience of professional medicine. He underscores the
					importance of primary care, and emphasises that future
					generations of Americans need not worry about the lack of
					access to primary care, including to qualified physicians. Due
					to vigilant advocacy by medical professional organisations
					and cost-conscious health payers, and due to government
					policies, there is and will continue to be a supply of primary
					care physicians and primary care residency programmes. Even
					if the demand for primary care outstrips the supply of primary
					care physicians, other specialists and non-physician healthcare
					providers are likely to fill the gaps.

				<h4> Do physicians care about patient choice? </h4>
				<p>
					The policy of patient choice was introduced in Sweden in the
					1990s to give patients the right to choose their healthcare
					providers. Evaluations have shown that few patients exercise
					this right. Questionnaire responses of physicians indicate
					that though physicians approve of the policy, only a minority regularly helped patients choose healthcare providers by
					giving them required information and allowing them to choose
					where to go. Instead, referrals were mostly based on medical
					grounds; the patient's right to choose a specific provider was
					considered less important. Thus, more than a decade after
					the policy was introduced only a minority of physicians acts
					according to political intention, explaining why many patients
					do not exercise their right to choose a hospital.

				Ethics of mandatory HIV testing </h5>

				<h4>Ethics of mandatory HIV testing</h4>
				<p>
					The global AIDS epidemic has recently lead to significant changes
					in HIV testing policies. Provider-initiated HIV testing has been
					embraced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
					and the World Health Organization; persons are to be routinely
					informed that they will be tested for HIV unless they explicitly
					refuse. While this practice increases the uptake of testing, a
					number of ethical concerns have raised and debated upon.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another form of "provider-initiated" testing being practised and
					promoted in various parts of the world has advocates within
					international health agencies: this is mandatory premarital
					HIV testing. However, this form of mandatory testing has
					received little attention in the bioethical literature. The authors
					of this essay analyse some of the key ethical issues related to
					mandatory premarital HIV testing in resource-poor settings
					with generalised HIV epidemics. They briefly discuss mandatory
					premarital testing proposals, policies and practices worldwide
					and offer conceptual and factual distinctions between the
					different types of policies, using Goma (Democratic Republic of
					Congo) as a point of departure.

				<h4>Making a case for counselling stressed physicians </h4>
				<p>
					The practice of medicine is highly stressful, and this is clear from
					the reports of high prevalence of depression and suicide among
					physicians compared to other professional groups. However,
					doctors are reluctant to seek help. This article reports on a
					study to investigating interventions for burn-out and emotional
					exhaustion for doctors in Norway. The intervention set out to
					motivate reflection on and acknowledgement of the doctors'
					situation and personal needs. One year after the intervention,
					doctors reported a reduction in emotional exhaustion and job
					stress. They had reduced their working hours by 1.6 hours and
					this was associated with a reduction in emotional exhaustion
					as well as a reduction in the proportion of doctors on full time
					sick leave. This study makes a case for early intervention and
					psychological help for stressed doctors, given the nature of their
					job, to lower the risk of burnout and mental distress.

				<h4>Patient attributes and clinical decision making</h4>
				<P>
					This study of clinical decision making found that physicians
					used their patients' demographic characteristics to assess

					considered predictive of adherence and therefore relevant
					to treatment decisions. Studies show that patients' basic
					demographic characteristics provide inadequate information
					to guide clinical decision making.

				<h4>Iran on contemporary medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Special attention has been paid towards ethics in Islam.
					Medical professionals and religious leaders in Iran have
					emphasised the importance of ethics. In the last decade,
					great strides have been made in biomedical ethics, education,
					research and legislation. The authors note the establishment
					of the National and Regional Committees for Medical Research
					Ethics, the production of national codes of ethics in biomedical
					research in the 1990s and the introduction of a comprehensive
					strategic plan for medical ethics at the national level in 2002.
					Additionally, specific national ethical guidelines for biomedical
					research were established in 2005.

				<h4>Ethics beyond borders</h4>
				<p>
					Health professionals involved in international humanitarian
					assistance and development work are frequently exposed to
					complex ethical issues. The authors of this article examine how
					health workers experience ethics in the course of humanitarian
					assistance and development work. Five core themes emerged
					from the data: the tension between respecting local customs
					and imposing values; the obstacles to providing adequate care;
					differing understandings of health and illness; questions of
					identity for health workers; and issues of trust and distrust. The
					authors make recommendations for organisational strategies
					that could help aid agencies support and equip their staff as
					they respond to ethical issues.

				<h4>Informed consent in the genomics era </h4>
				<p>
					Genetic cohort studies storing biological materials hold great
					promise for medical research. They also present new ethical
					problems that are profoundly different from those associated
					with the classical clinical trial. One example is in the concept of
					informed consent. The classical risk/benefit analysis of physical
					harm does not take into account new threats to the individual
					such as the inability to obtain insurance, unemployment,
					genetic discrimination, or disruption of family relationships.
					Traditional informed consent may therefore no longer be
					appropriate when dealing with long-term studies usingbiological materials. Informed consent should be seen as an
					ongoing process between researcher and participant, and not
					just as a once-and-for-all decision. Research following the initial
					storage of samples needs to be likewise explained and may be
					announced using new communication methods.

				<h4>Exploitation vs undue inducement clinical trials</h4>
				<p>
					There is an apparent tension between undue inducement and
					exploitation in clinical trials. On the one hand, it is claimed
					that increasing the benefits to research subjects enrolled in
					international clinical trials could result in undue inducement.
					On the other hand, international trial sponsors are accused of
					exploitation because they do not provide research subjects
					with a fair share of the benefits of research. The authors
					introduce an analysis of the available research findings
					on research participants' otivations and the influence of
					payments on research subjects' behaviour and risk assessment.
					Findings suggest that financial rewards do not distort research
					subjects' behaviour or blind them to the risks involved with
					research. The author concludes that research sponsors should
					prioritise the prevention of exploitation in international
					research by providing greater benefits to research participants.

				<h4>Obtaining consent in clinical trials</h4>
				<p>
					A study in the metropolitan region of Campinas presents
					findings on informed consent for studies on contraceptive
					methods. The consensus among women who have participated
					(or are participating) in clinical trials on women's health was
					that the person who invites a woman to participate in a study
					should be a member of the research team but not the principal
					investigator. Study-related information should be given both
					orally and in writing, both individually and in the group setting.
					Study volunteers should be informed about the risks, possible
					side effects and discomforts, including long-term effects. The
					use of audiovisual aids to provide information is suggested.

					Little is known about how frequently news articles report

					The researchers' surveyed company funded research published

					funding; 67 % of articles reporting on medications referred to

				<h4>Off-label promotion,on-target sales</h4>
				<p>
					The authors discuss the practice of off-label promotion
					of drugs. They point out that such practices for untested,
					unproven benefits maximise industry profits at the expense
					of public health. Pharmaceutical marketing has distorted the
					discourse on off-label uses and encouraged the unmonitored,
					potentially dangerous use of drugs by patients for whom risks
					and benefits are unknown.
				</p>
				<p>
					The authors suggest that while off-label use may sometimes
					be necessary, it should be undertaken with care and caution
					and the subject should be discussed by unbiased researchers
					in bona fide medical journals. Promising therapies should
					be tested in clinical trials. Companies that engage in off-label
					promotion should be heavily fined and their future marketing
					practices subject to increased scrutiny by regulatory agencies.
					At the same time, financial incentives could be provided to
					reward physicians and others who report off-label promotion.
					Restrictions on off-label promotion of drugs should be
					strengthened, not gutted.

				<h4>Making sense of non-financial competing interests</h4>
				<p>
					The writers of this editorial discuss the concept of the nonfinancial
					competing interest. Like commercial interests, nonfinancial
					competing interests can influence professional
					judgment. As with all competing interests, the dispute is how
					to manage them. It is accepted that political interference
					in science is dangerous, that governments and funders do
					not make decisions on the basis of science alone, and that
					intellectual and professional commitments often lead to strong
					personal views. It is thus the responsibility of journals and the
					wider research communities to safeguard the credibility of the
					scientific and editorial processes. Steps taken must include
					full disclosure, which allows for others to make informed
					judgments about whether there are competing interests,
					and whether they are relevant. Journals can develop clear
					and explicit policies that outline definitions of non-financial
					conflicts of interests and expectations for author, reviewer, and
					editorial behaviour, ensuring transparency.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, despite the messy and imprecise nature of
					private interests, researchers and editors must persist in
					establishing a better understanding of their extent and impact.
