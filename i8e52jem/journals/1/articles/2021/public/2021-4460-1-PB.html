				<h4>Rights violations in population  policies</h4>
				<p>
					We reproduce, below, a letter written to Justice JS  Varma Chair, National Human Rights Commission New Delhi. The letter  in its extracted form is in the print edition of the same issue.

				<p>
					Justice J.S.Varma Chair,
					<br>
					National Human Rights Commission
					<br>
					New Delhi
				</p>
				<p>
					Dear Sir,
				</p>
				<p>
					We, representatives of women's groups and health  groups, are deeply disturbed by several issues pertaining to population  policies in our country.
				</p>
				<p>
					In February 2000, the Government of India adopted  the National Population Policy 2000. One undoubtedly positive feature of the  policy is that it resolutely affirms the "commitment of the government  towards voluntary and informed choice and consent of citizens while availing of  reproductive health care services, and continuation of the target free approach  in administering family planning services".
				</p>
				<p>
					It is thus profoundly disturbing that several State  governments have announced population policies, which, in very significant  ways, violate the letter and the spirit of the National Population Policy.  Annexure I provides a summary of these State Population Policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Press reports (Outlook, 29th April 2002, <em>Hindustan Times,</em> 23rd April 2002, Annexures III and IV) indicate that, instead of preventing  these distortions, the Union cabinet is considering a "Strategy  Paper"(Annexure V) to review the national family welfare programme and  policy which also violates the spirit of the NPP.
				</p>
				<p>
					We would also like to bring to your notice, a Bill  that has been framed in Uttar Pradesh, the Uttar Pradesh Population Control  Bill, 2002 (Annexure VI). This Bill codifies all the anti-human rights features  of the State Population Policies that we have referred to. This Bill is clearly  violative of the provisions of the NPP 2000.
				</p>
				<p>
					You would notice that the State population policies  contain a series of disincentives and incentives that are anti-women,  anti-adivasis, anti-dalit and anti-poor in general. They also are profoundly  violative of human and democratic rights.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The disincentives proposed, such as denying  ration cards and education in government schools for the third child,  withdrawal of a range of welfare programmes for the Scheduled Castes and  Scheduled Tribes with more than two children, debarring such people from  government jobs etc. are questionable on various grounds. The National Family Health Survey for  1998-99 shows that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is 3.15 for S.Cs, 3.06 for  S.Ts, 2.66 among O.B.Cs and 3.47 among illiterate women as a whole. It is, in  contrast, 1.99 among better off women and those likely to be educated beyond  the tenth grade. Imposition of the two-child norm, and the disincentives  proposed, would thus mean that significant sections among those already  deprived populations would bear the brunt of the state's withdrawal of  ameliorative measures, as pitiably inadequate as they are.
					</li>
					<li>
						The two-child norm bars large sections of  dalits, adivasis and the poor in general from contesting elections to the PRIs  and thus deprives them of their democratic rights. Further, in the States where  they have been imposed, as in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we are  aware of substantial numbers of women who have been deserted, or forced to  undergo sex selective abortions. In general, such a norm provides an impetus  for an increase in sex-selective abortions, worsening an already terrible child  sex ratio in the country.
					</li>
					<li>
						As the NPP itself acknowledges, there is a large  need for health and safe contraceptive services. To propose punitive measures  in this context is clearly absurd. Reflecting deprivation, the dalits, adivasis  and Other Backward Castes bear a significantly higher proportion of the  mortality load in the country. The National Family Health Survey for 1998-99,  notes that the Infant Mortality Rate among the S.Cs, S.T.s and Other Backward  Castes is 83, 84 and 76 respectively, compared to 62 for Others. Similarly the  Under Five Mortality Rate is 119 among the S.Cs, 126 among the S.T.s 103 among  the O.B.Cs compared to 82 among the Others. Clearly, to impose a two-child norm  under such circumstances is to widen the inequality gap among our people.  Instead of dealing with the causes for these differentials, what the state  population policies seek do is to punish victims for their poverty and  deprivation.
					</li>
					<li>
						The proposals violate several fundamental  rights, the Directive Principles of the Constitution of India, as well as  several international Covenants that India is signatory to, including the ICRC,  CEDAW as well as the Beijing Platform of Action and the Cairo Declaration.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					We are astonished to learn from the press reports  referred to earlier, that the Union Cabinet could consider discussing the so  called strategy paper which does not have the imprimatur of either the National  Population Commission or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The  anonymous document thus does not carry the mandate of any statutory, advisory  or decision-making body.
				</p>
				<p>
					The document itself is poorly substantiated by  data, deeply contradictory and shockingly at variance with the National  Population Policy 2000. Although the NPP 2000 can be described as weak on many  counts, it is firmly committed to respect for human rights, freedom and dignity  of women, values that all of us cherish. These were translated into a  non-target oriented family welfare programme, which rightly abjured incentives  and disincentives. The NPP, as we noted earlier, recognises that there is a  large and unmet need for quality health and reproductive and child health  services; it also recognises that infant mortality rates are still  unconscionably high and that there is an urgent need to strengthen health  services, attending particularly to the needs of the poor and the marginalised.  Above all, it recognises the need for quality services which respect the  dignity of people, even as it emphasises equity.
				</p>
				<p>
					The "Strategy Paper", on the other hand,  is drafted in the a-historical and unscientific language of Malthusian  scare-mongering. While it recognises that infrastructure is weak, and that the  quality and coverage of health services are poor, it absurdly attributes these  failures of the State primarily to population growth. While it recognises that  there is an adverse sex ratio, it is not averse to calling for a two-child  national norm when it is absolutely clear that such norms have indeed  contributed to the adverse sex ratio. While it recognises that there is an  unmet need for health and family welfare services, it contradictorily calls for  a range of incentives and disincentives, holding up Andhra Pradesh as an  example. Further, it argues, incorrectly, that China continues to have a  one-child norm. In any case, comparisons between India and China are inapposite  for a large number of reasons, including per-capita incomes, achievements in  health, equity and education that India can unfortunately not boast of.  Finally, the so-called strategy paper invidiously suggests that concern for  rights and equity are current only in NGOs financially supported by UNFPA.
				</p>
				<p>
					It needs to be put on record that we had, even  before the ICPD, and indeed with no links to the UNFPA, critiqued the family  planning policy as it then existed. The population policy in the country, it  was noted, "has been one of fertility control, pursued relentlessly, and  at times coercively, bringing disrepute to the family planning programme and  compromising women's health and accelerating the declining sex ratio". It  is possibly in the light of such critiques, along with the commitments made at  the ICPD at Cairo, that the NPP 2000 abjures targets, incentives, disincentives  and specifying a two-child norm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depriving children of their rights to survival and  development is not only violative of the International Convention on the Rights  of the Child, but also of successive directives of the Supreme Court to enhance  their right to education. We request the NHRC to direct States to comply with these  directives and not use population policies to deny these rights.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments sought  to strengthen and expand the base for India's democratic governance by  providing Constitutional recognition to local self-government bodies. The  States' legislations on Panchayati Raj providing disqualifications on the basis  of the two-child norm, invariably cite the National Population Policy as the  rationale for such restrictive and punitive measure for elected representatives  of the Panchayats, when the National Population Policy does not provide such a  norm. Moreover, similar disqualifications are absent for representatives  elected to State Assemblies and Parliament. We request the NHRC to take  cognisance of this violation of Constitutional rights, and direct States to  strike down these provisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					And finally we urge you to take necessary measures  to ensure that steps proposed in the so-called "Strategy Paper" and  the U.P.Population Control Bill that violate human rights are not now included  in the population policy.
