				<h4>Aniruddha Malpani, Anjali Malpani Successful private
				practice&mdash;winning strategies for doctors. New Delhi: UBS
				Publishers Distributors Pvt. Ltd., 2004. price not
				mentioned pp 314</h4>
				<p>
					Drs Aniruddha and Anjali Malpani wear many hats. They
					operate a clinic to help infertile couples. They have set
					up a library where lay persons can access information on
					any aspect of health and medical care. They write in a
					various journals, on a wide range of topics. This is their
					fourth book. They have also set up a management
					consultancy on medical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Starting with Dr John Shaw Billings' quotation, made in
					a different context ('The education of the doctor which
					goes on after he has his degree, is, after all, the most
					important part of his education.'), the authors guide
					doctors striving to build a successful private practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thirty-eight chapters cover such topics as 'Designing your
					clinic', skills in business management, financial planning,
					hiring and training employees, crisis management,
					medical ethics, etc. There are even suggestions on how
					you can make your marriage work, bring up your children
					and be a happy doctor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The readers are advised to attract media attention. We are
					told that many doctors now employ public relations firms
					to ensure that their names appear in the media as often as
					possible. The authors do not disapprove of this practice.
					Free demonstrations to the media, inviting local celebrities
					to such events, using hospitals to which the doctor is
					attached as marketing partners, ensuring the loyalty of
					doctors referring patients by congratulating them and even
					their children on their accomplishments and befriending
					staff members in the clinics of referring physicians are
					some of the tips offered. Doctors are advised to develop
					themselves as a brand name. Arguments are offered on
					why advertising yourself is not unethical. In the chapter
					entitled 'Winning your patients' loyalty' we are told to
					apologise to the patient after listening to her complaint
					whether we are right or wrong. 'The patient is seeking an
					apology. Offer it so the patient can move forward. Pamper
					your patients as much as possible.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Simple English and a chatty manner of writing make for
					easy reading. Bulleted lists emphasise key points. Wit and
					humour are scattered throughout the volume. The preface
					itself, is a chuckle-raiser. 'A hundred years ago...the successful
					doctor was said to need three things: a top hat to give him
					authority, a paunch to give him dignity and piles to give him
					an anxious expression.' Dr Hemant Morparia's many fans
					will find a generous sample of his cartoons. I was confused
					by the placement of the cartoons as they bear no relationship
					to the preceeding or succeeding text. One cartoon has been
					printed twice (on pages 248 and 257).
				</p>
				<p>
					Statements such as 'As many as one-third of all doctors
					report that medical practice leaves them dissatisfied...' leave
					the reader puzzled as there is no evidence to support them.
					The book has an index but lacks a bibliography.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I find the authors' suggestions on the organisation
					of a clinic, streamlining practical, day-to-day tasks,
					maintaining records, training one's staff and improving
					their morale useful, I disagree with their recommendations
					on making myself popular, advertising my
					capabilities and ensuring that I stay in the limelight all
					the time. I also disagree with the suggestion that I need to
					pamper my patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					My teachers taught me that I belong to an honourable
					profession with a strong code of ethics and must balance
					my rights with responsibilities. They advised that I need
					to be a competent physician and must treat my patients
					to the best of my abilities, concentrating on their wellbeing
					at all times. Empathy with them will ensure that I
					treat them as I would like to be treated, were I in their
					place. They also taught me that if I performed my duties
					properly, patients would seek me out. I was cautioned
					against the temptation to project myself to patients, family
					physicians and colleagues in any manner except through
					my work. I have benefited greatly from these lessons. If it
					ever becomes necessary for me to use the tactics that
					dominate commerce, I would prefer leaving the
					profession of medicine and turning to some other
					occupation.
