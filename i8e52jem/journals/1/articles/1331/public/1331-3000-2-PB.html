						<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
					</li>
					<p>
						1. The World  Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of  ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in  medical research involving human subjects. Medical research involving human  subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.
					</p>
					<p>
						2. It is the  duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The  physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this  duty.
					</p>
					<p>
						3. The  Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with  the words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the  International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only  in the patient's interest when providing medical care which might have the  effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the patient."
					</p>
					<p>
						4. Medical  progress is based on research which ultimately must rest in part on  experimentation involving human subjects.
					</p>
					<p>
						5. In medical  research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the  human subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.
					</p>
					<p>
						6. The primary  purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve  prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of  the aetiology and pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven prophylactic,  diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must continuously be challenged through  research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.
					</p>
					<p>
						7. In current  medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and  therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.
					</p>
					<p>
						8. Medical research  is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and  protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and  need special protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically  disadvantaged must be recognized. Special attention is also required for those  who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject  to giving consent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from  the research and for those for whom the research is combined with care.
					</p>
					<p>
						9. Research  Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements  for research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable  international requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory  requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for  human subjects set forth in this Declaration.
					</p>

					<li>
						<h4>BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH</h4>
					</li>
					<p>
						10. It is the  duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy,  and dignity of the human subject.
					</p>
					<p>
						11. Medical  research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific  principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature,  other relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where  appropriate, animal experimentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						12. Appropriate  caution must be exercised in the conduct of research which may affect the  environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.
					</p>
					<p>
						13. The design  and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should  be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be  submitted for consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval  to a specially appointed ethical review committee, which must be independent of  the investigator, the sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This  independent committee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of  the country in which the research experiment is performed. The committee has  the right to monitor ongoing trials. The researcher has the obligation to  provide monitoring information to the committee, especially any serious adverse  events. The researcher should also submit to the committee, for review,  information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other  potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects.
					</p>
					<p>
						14. The  research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical  considerations involved and should indicate that there is compliance with the  principles enunciated in this Declaration.
					</p>
					<p>
						15. Medical  research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically  qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical  person. The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a  medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even  though the subject has given consent.
					</p>
					<p>
						16. Every  medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful  assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable  benefits to the subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation  of healthy volunteers in medical research. The design of all studies should be  publicly available.
					</p>
					<p>
						17. Physicians  should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects  unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed  and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if  the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is  conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.
					</p>
					<p>
						18. Medical  research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance of  the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is  especially important when the human subjects are healthy volunteers.
					</p>
					<p>
						19. Medical  research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the  populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the  results of the research.
					</p>
					<p>
						20. The  subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the research project.
					</p>
					<p>
						21. The right  of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected.  Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the  confidentiality of the patient's information and to minimize the impact of the  study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of  the subject.
					</p>
					<p>
						22. In any  research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of  the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest,  institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and  potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject  should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or  to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring  that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then  obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If  the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must be  formally documented and witnessed.
					</p>
					<p>
						23. When  obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be  particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the  physician or may consent under duress. In that case the informed consent should  be obtained by a well-informed physician who is not engaged in the  investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.
					</p>
					<p>
						24. For a  research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapable  of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must  obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance  with applicable law. These groups should not be included in research unless the  research is necessary to promote the health of the population represented and  this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.
					</p>
					<p>
						25. When a  subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give  assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigator must  obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized  representative.
					</p>
					<p>
						26. Research on  individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or  advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that  prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the  research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with  a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated  in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review  committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research  should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally  authorized surrogate.
					</p>
					<p>
						27. Both  authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results  of research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the  results. Negative as well as positive results should be published or otherwise  publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any  possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports  of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this  Declaration should not be accepted for publication.
					</p>

					<li>
						<h4>ADDITIONAL  PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE</h4>
					</li>
					<p>
						28. The  physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent  that the research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or  therapeutic value. When medical research is combined with medical care,  additional standards apply to protect the patients who are research subjects.
					</p>
					<p>
						29. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be  tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and  therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment,  in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method  exists.
					</p>
					<p>
						30. At the  conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study should be assured  of access to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods  identified by the study.
					</p>
					<p>
						31. The  physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related  to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study must never  interfere with the patient-physician relationship.
					</p>
					<p>
						32. In the  treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic  methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent  from the patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic  and therapeutic measures, if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of  saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible,  these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate  their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded  and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this  Declaration should be followed

				<p>
					WMA  clarifications as we go to press
				</p>
				<p>

					The  World Medical Association clarified its stand on the ethical use of placebo  controlled trials. This follows criticism that the revised Declaration of  Helsinki laid down impractical guidelines for researchersin many parts of  theworld. <strong>The revision had particular implications for research in  developingcountries, where the testing of new drugs against the best  currenttreatment would have massively increased the cost ofresearch.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The WMA has  agreed that the use of placebo in researchtrials might be ethically acceptable  when compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons made its use  necessary to determine the efficacy orsafety of a prophylactic, diagnostic, or  therapeutic method; or when a prophylactic, diagnostic, or therapeutic method  was being investigated for a minor condition and patients whoreceived placebo  would not be subject to any additional risk ofserious or irreversibleharm.
