				<h4>Too old to treat</h4>
				<p>
					Eighty-year-old  John Quinn was denied a mitral heart valve replacement by two public hospitals  in Australia, and was forced to have the operation in a private hospital  instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Associate  Professor Peter Thursby, president of the Australian Medical Association, said  "tenuous clinical grounds are being increasingly used to avoid doing  surgery on elderly patients."
				</p>
				<p>
					The  government decides hospital budgets, and hospital clinical teams create  processes that formally or informally ration certain operations for certain  groups of patients, generally prioritising on the basis of -life expectancy.  Patients with low life expectancies are either placed low on the waiting list  or told that they are unlikely to be accepted. The prime minister, John Howard,  denies that rationing occurs.

				<h4>The right to medical treatment</h4>
				<p>
					The  Human Rights Act received royal assent in Britain, paving the way for patients  to challenge the refusal of medical treatment on cost grounds. The act  incorporates into UK law the European Convention on Human Rights. Implementation  is certain to raise issues of National Health Service resources and health-care  rationing. Judges' powers under judicial review &mdash; the means by which treatments are challenged &mdash; will become much  wider under the act. Human Rights Act will allow challenges to treatment  refusals.

				<h4>Legal help to die</h4>
				<p>
					Eighty-year-old  C A Thomas from Pavaratty, Kerala, filed a writ petition in the Kerala high  court for directions for a medically assisted voluntary death, as well as the  establishment of a 'voluntary death clinic' attached to every district  hospital, with facilities for a comfortable death and arrangements to examine  the voluntary nature of the decision. The Union of India and the state of  Kerala are asked to appoint a commission to study the practice of voluntary  death in ancient India and suggest methods for its practice in the context of  technological advancements today; and to set up an infrastructure to facilitate  voluntary death and organ donation.

				<h4>Just can't afford to fall ill</h4>
				<p>
					Drug  prices have shot up by 50 to 200 per cent ever since government controls on  drug prices were relaxed in July 1995, says Dr Wishwas Rane, member of the Drug  Action Forum. A study found the price of 41 products increased by over 100 per  cent. Aspirin is selling for 200 to 483 per cent more than the government's  ceiling price. Mumbai's general practitioners say they are under pressure to  use stronger, more expensive drugs to show immediate results, and consumer  activists feel irrational prescriptions will continue till the government  implements the essential drug list, a basic index of drugs for most ailments.  Pharmaceutical companies argue that Indian drugs are the cheapest in the world,  though this will change with the introduction of product patents in 2005.

				<h4>A grading system for hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					A  voluntary accreditation scheme may soon evaluate Mumbai hospitals and nursing  homes for space, equipment, staff quality, consumer satisfaction and more.  "In essence it is self-regulation," says Dr Lalit Kapoor, convenor of  the Forum of Medical Associations and member of the Forum for Standards in  Health care, which is approaching financial institution-s for: funding. Eighty-three  per cent of the hospitals and nursing homes surveyed responded positively.  "The consumer protection act and the resultant medico-legal environment,  the proposed entry of private insurance and the growing quality consciousness  make nursing homes more amenable to ratings," says Dr Kapoor.
				</p>
				<p>
					However,  only 25 per cent of the hospitals wanted the system to include punitive action,  37 per cent to monitor professional fees and 41 per cent to monitor hospital  charges. Forty-three percent wanted patient redressal procedures to be  incorporated into the accreditation system.

				<h4>Women in clinical trials</h4>
				<p>
					The  United States Food and Drug Administration has proposed a rule to prevent the  routine exclusion of women in early studies of drugs to treat life-threatening  diseases just because of potential risks of toxicity to offspring or  reproductive organs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  rationale: a commitment to expanding access to and accelerating approval of new  therapies for life-threatening diseases; recognition that physicians and  patients are generally willing to accept greater potential risks or side  effects from medical products to treat life-threatening diseases, and together  can make their own risk/benefit decision when given thorough information.

				<h4>Anaemia is a rights violation</h4>
				<p>
					The  National Human Rights Commission has formed a core group to address women's and  children's health. Fifty percent of the country's infant mortality rate is due  to low birth weight. Forty-seven per cent of pregnant women have  moderate-to-severe anaemia. The neglect of the 28-year-old National Nutritional  Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme is "essentially a serious breach of national  responsibility, cutting the very roots of basic human rights to life, and good  physical and mental health," says N Kochupillai, head of endocrinology and  metabolism at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

				<h4>Doctors who execute are 'protected' by the state</h4>
				<p>
					A group  of American doctors is suing the state of California to stop requiring doctors  to participate in executions, contending that such participation violates the  Hippocratic oath and is contrary to ethical practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some 27  US states require the presence of doctors at executions, administering lethal  injections, witnessing executions, and certifying prisoners' deaths. The  Illinois government gives anonymity to such doctors to prevent their  "persecution" by medical societies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile,  theAmerican Medical Association (AMA), the American College of Physicians, and  most state medical societies bar doctors from taking part in executions. The  AMA allows psychiatric evaluations of competency to sit for an execution, but  not to treat a mentally incompetent condemned prisoner if it is likely to lead  to execution.

				<h4>The anti-fertility vaccine: unsound and unsafe</h4>
				<p>
					Women's  health groups protested at the 10th international congress of immunology in New  Delhi, describing immunological contraception as "scientifically unsound  and inherently unsafe". A report by Saheli Women's Resource Centre accused  scientists of trying contraceptive vaccines on humans without establishing  their safety and efficacy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of the  six contraceptive vaccines aimed at eliciting antibodies against reproductive  hormones, only one &mdash; the 'Talwar vaccine', developed at Delhi's National  Institute of Immunology &mdash; reached phase II clinical trials, and only 80 per  cent of the vaccinated women developed antibody litres above the threshold of  50 ng/ml required to prevent pregnancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Saheli report also claimed that Indian researchers followed up children born to  women during or after the trials for only four years. Talwar, however, reported  that long-term studies of the progeny of primates tested with the vaccine show  that it is "completely safe." Conference delegates suggested that  opposition to basic research was "premature and unscientific "

				<h4>Euthanasia: the easy way out</h4>
				<p>
					Euthanasia  in the Netherlands is proving detrimental to the practice of medicine and is  usually avoidable, says Dutch palliative care physician Dr Ben Zylicz.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  practice of non-voluntary euthanasia &mdash; in which the patient is unable to give  consent &mdash; is becoming widespread, in contravention of Dutch guidelines, warned Dr  Zylicz. He suggested that the fact that there were only 70 specialist  palliative care beds in the country was a reason why doctors and patients often  resorted to euthanasia. Many patients needing terminal care were currently  discharged to their general physicians, few of whom received training in  palliative medicine &mdash; as a result of which they saw euthanasia as the only  solution if the patient's suffering became too great. At quarter of the patients  admitted to the hospice where Dr Zylicz works had initially requested  euthanasia, but none had ultimately used it.

				<h4>The right to refuse a caesarean</h4>
				<p>
					In the  UK, a 30-year-old woman who developed pre-eclampsia in the 36th week of  pregnancy was admitted into hospital against her will for assessment under the  Mental Health Act, and her child was delivered by Caesarean following court  orders, though the woman was not treated for mental illness. The judge ruled  that she had been wrongly detained, and was entitled to refuse the invasion of  her body. Pregnancy does not reduce a woman's right to refuse medical  treatment; an unborn child's need for medical assistance does not prevail over  the mother's rights.

				<h4>TB: the new stigma</h4>
				<p>
					The  World Health Organization has cautioned that national policies to screen  immigrants for tuberculosis would stop infectious patients from seeking or  continuing treatment. One country has deported 1030 legal workers, and another  plans to deny entry to "any individual who is or is likely to be a danger  to public health or public safety." Screening measures cannot protect  citizens against all infectious diseases, especially TB which is spread through  the air.

The trials would be approved by an  ethics committee involving the National Human Rights Commission, and funded by  the US National Institutes of Health, the International AIDS Vaccine  Initiative, and the $250 million World Bank loan.

				<h4>Ethics of AZT</h4>
				<p>
					As a  large number of pregnant women are already infected with HIV, the medical  community is confronted with ethical questions on how to treat HIV-infected  pregnant women. Some 30-40 per cent of their children will become infected,  either in utero or during breast feeding. The government is planning trials of  AZT, which costs Rs 50,000 per child saved. But if AZT is stopped suddenly, it  can increase the levels of virus in the mother. If breastfeeding reduces the  risk of transmission, babies without breast milk can succumb to malnutrition.  Promoting bottle-feeding for HIV positive women could stigmatise them.

				<h4>HIV and marriage</h4>
				<p>
					The  supreme court ruled that persons suffering from certain contagious diseases  cannot enforce their right to marry. A hospital does not violate medical ethics  of confidentiality when it informs the spouse or would-be spouse of an  HIV-positive person of the health condition, and it is not liable for  compensation if the marriage is cancelled as a result. When there is a clash  between one person's right to privacy and the other's right to life, the right  which would advance public morality would be enforced. However, AIDS patients  deserve full sympathy and respect, they should not be shunned, and they should  not be denied jobs or services.
