					...We have been actively engaged in the Medical Audit of patient care in our hospital for the last 6 years... Our problems of medical ethics vary from lack of human emotional approach to greed for money; over treatment and over investigation; multiple consultations and visits; gross negligence and taking shelter under medical diagnoses in which multiple disciplines overlap.
				</p>
				<p>
					Absence of definite guidelines from Universities or Medical Councils in defining the limits of the field of a discipline - whether it be a generalist or internist or subspecialist; absence of guidelines regarding the charges for laboratory tests, operations, consultations and visits... cause much distress to patients, management and professionals...
