              <p>Renu Addlakha (RA) discusses a number of pertinent ethical
                issues in the summary of her research <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Addlakha Renu. Ethical quandaries in anthropological fieldwork in psychiatric settings. IJME 2005; 2: 55-56." id="1">(1)</a>. These issues could
                be generally divided into three categories: confidentiality,
                freedom of participation and consent, and the therapeutic
              misconception.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="section">
  <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
  <p>RA stated that she had been given permission by the institution
    to review patient charts. She correctly noted that while this
    permission may have given her legal access to the charts it did
    not absolve her from the ethical need to obtain explicit consent
    from patients and/or their families to use the files.</p>
  <p>RA assured study subjects that information provided to her
    would be kept strictly confidential. Is it possible that in some
    instances, for example, if a subject were to indicate that she
    had abused a child, there would be specific legal requirements
    to report such information to the appropriate authorities? In
    Canada we can rarely promise absolute confidentiality and a
    similar constraint may apply to researchers in India.</p>
          </div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Freedom of participation and consent</h4>
  <p>The research study was made possible through the co-operation
    of the department of psychiatry. In addition to conducting the
    research, RA was invited to participate in various departmental
    activities like medical consultations, rounds and case
    conferences. Patients then correctly identified RA as being part
    of the hospital establishment and were placed in the position of
    feeling obligated to participate in her study in order to ensure
    the continuation of their treatment. RA sensibly handled this
    potentially coercive situation by ensuring that patients were
    reminded that the study and their treatment were independent
    and by providing them the time to think about participation
    and to ask questions. In North America, as in Asia, patients may feel obligated to participate in research because of authority,
    education and class factors. Perceived coercion may be subtle
    but very real.</p>
  <p>In Canada many psychiatric patients would be considered
    competent to provide their own consent to participate in
    research rather than having their families consent. No doubt
    there are cultural differences in this. For example, patients may
    be hospitalised at different levels of disease in different countries.
    If there is doubt about a patient's competency, it is best to have
    a formal competency assessment conducted by a psychiatrist
    who is not involved in the research study. This assessment
    would supplement any advice provided by the attending staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Therapeutic misconception</h4>
  <p>RA notes that patients' families often believe that &quot;participation
    in research might lead to additional privileges at the treatment
    level&quot;. I suspect the problem is actually a deeper one in that
    patients and their families may confuse research with treatment
    and may feel that those in authority in the hospital would not
    ask them to participate in an activity that would not have a
    direct treatment benefit for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>It would appear that RA conducted a thoughtful and ethical
    study. One might suggest that in future studies of this kind,
    resources permitting, provision be made to reimburse research
    participants for their time and expenses (if any). This would fall
    within the principle of non-exploitation <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Council of Medical Research. Ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects. New Delhi: ICMR; 2000." id="2">(2)</a>.</p>
