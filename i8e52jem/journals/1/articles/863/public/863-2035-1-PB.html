					There is no doubt      that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has added to the      professional hazards of some doctors and other health professionals. HIV      infection is fatal and without a cure, though there are chances that it can      be eradicated if drug therapy is started immediately after the onset of the      infection. Hence, it is quite natural that medical professionals are afraid      of acquiring HIV infection from patients. This issue of risk to medical      professionals is serious. Despite these facts, I believe doctors and      hospitals should not be allowed to refuse treatment to patients for the      reason that they are HIV positive.

				<h4>Unscientific and unethical policy</h4>
				<p>
					The boycott policy is unscientific. It is neither an effective way to slow      down the HIV epidemic nor does it achieve its purported aim of protecting      doctors from being infected by HIV-positive patients.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, doctors will certainly come in contact with an HIV-positive      patient's blood in emergency situations, before the patient undergoes a      blood test. In non-emergency situations, the attending staff will come in      contact with the blood, urine and stools of patients who are HIV infected      before they are tested.
				</p>
				<p>
					Second, a test conducted in the early stages of HIV infection will not show      a positive result. During this 'window period' the person can transmit the      infection to others, despite a negative test result. It is for this reason      that all health professionals are advised to take universal precautions and      assume that all patients they treat are HIV-positive. Overall, the boycott      policy is based on the irrational panic of doctors.
				</p>

				<h4>Limited grounds to refuse treatment</h4>
				<p>
					There are only a few      grounds on which medical professionals can refuse treatment to a patient.      One is when the patient refuses to follow the treatment advised by the      doctor. Another is when a patient already under the care of one      doctor approaches another for treatment. Such patients cannot be accepted      unless they are referred by their first doctor, or they leave the care of      the first doctor. Finally, a patient whose treatment is beyond the      expertise of the doctor can be directed to an expert.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a capitalist society, however, other considerations creep in. Since      medical care is a commodity, laws of the market cast their shadow on      medical ethics. Thus, a doctor can refuse patients if they cannot pay his      fees, or if they approach the doctor outside his consultation timings      (emergency situations excluded). But if a patient approaches the doctor, is      ready to pay the fees and has an illness which is not beyond the expertise      of the doctor, the doctor must accept the patient. This duty towards the      patient is underscored by the fact that the medical profession is a noble      one and doctors should not refuse any patient who is ready to follow the basic      rules of the doctor-patient relationship.
				</p>
				<p>
					It has been argued that doctors have a right to refuse to enter into a      contract with any given patient, for whatever reason, just as other      professionals have this right. I think that this is a misinterpretation of      the right of the doctor as the seller of a medical service. The Medical      Council of India has limited the rights of the patient to be treated by a      particular doctor to the conditions mentioned above. Even with the limited      framework of such ethics in a capitalist society, it would be inhumane and      unethical for a doctor to refuse any patient on any other grounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even in the case of a shopkeeper, so long as the buyer approaches during      business hours and is ready to pay a reasonable price for the available commodities,      the shopkeeper cannot turn away the buyer. It is true that a profession is      different from a business, but a claim towards the doctor's unlimited right      to refuse to enter into a contract with a patient has no roots in the logic      of the specificities of the medical profession.

				<h4>The debate between health activists and doctors</h4>
				<p>
					In the proposed 'Maharashtra Clinical Establishments (MCE) Act, 2001'      (which is a modified version of the current Bombay Nursing Homes      Registration Act, 1949) the section 'Obligations of Clinical Establishment'      specifies the obligations that every clinical establishment will have to      fulfil. In this section, the draft says, 'The clinical establishment shall      not refuse admission of any patient suffering from human immunodeficiency      virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).'
				</p>
				<p>
					Actually, the government cannot make it compulsory for all doctors to treat      AIDS patients. Doctors who do not have the necessary expertise cannot be      made to treat AIDS patients. On the contrary, such doctors can be legally      punished for treating AIDS patients. The government wants to make legal      provisions to ensure that HIV-positive persons seeking medical treatment      for some other condition are not discriminated against. The formulation      quoted above from the draft of the forthcoming MCE Act, 2001 needs to be      changed accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many doctors are opposed to this provision. CEHAT took the initiative to      convene a meeting of doctors and health activists to discuss such      controversial provisions in the draft Act. Dr Ketan Parikh of the      Association of Medical Consultants (AMC), Mumbai, said that though he      himself does not refuse HIV-positive patients, he would strongly argue in      favour of the right of doctors to refuse a patient on the grounds of HIV      positivity <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Parikh K. The right to refuse treatment. Issues in Medical Ethics 2003;11:75-76 " id="1">(1)</a>. All the health activists strongly argued in favour of the right      of the HIV-positive person not to be discriminated against. Our argument      has been outlined above.
				</p>
				<p>
					The doctors put forth a practical difficulty. They said that their staff      would not treat HIV-positive patients properly even if they themselves were      willing to treat such patients. However, one senior consultant pointed out      that, in his experience, many doctors have an irrational phobia about      treating any HIV-positive patient. He argued that if doctors themselves      behave in a non-discriminatory way, paramedics tend to follow their      example.
				</p>
				<p>
					Health activists conceded that some doctors face this difficulty. They      suggested a way out. A systematic educational programme in the form of a      certificate course can be launched to orient all health professionals and      remove their excessive anxiety, based on ignorance, about the occupational      risk of HIV transmission to health professionals. This can be organised in      such a way that it covers all health professionals in the state within two      years. After two years, no clinical establishment would be permitted to      employ personnel who have not received a certificate. Representatives of      the AMC finally agreed to this suggestion. The consensus statement was:      'Refusal to entertain any patient who also has HIV infection should not be      allowed. But it cannot be made obligatory that all doctors must treat all      patients for HIV disease, as this treatment is many a times a specialist      job which not every doctor would be able to handle competently.'

				<h4>Finding rational, practical solutions</h4>
				<p>
					The government, with the help of concerned experts in the field, including      non-governmental organisations (NGOs), should prepare standard orientation      courses on the care of HIV-positive patients, for different types of      medical care workers ranging from doctors to attendants. Such courses would      include the basics of HIV/AIDS, including its social aspects, universal      precautions, and the duty of doctors and other medical professionals      towards HIV-positive patients. This course should be publicly funded. Half      the funds can come from the service charges collected from medical      establishments under the MCE Act. The Maharashtra government must set up      adequate facilities so that all medical workers in these establishments can      undergo this course within a year after the enforcement of this amended Act      and all medical workers must register themselves to undergo this course      within this time. As soon as all the staff of an establishment complete the      course, it must implement a policy ensuring that there is no discrimination      against HIV-positive patients. After two years, no medical establishment      may employ medical staff who have not undergone this certificate course.
				</p>
				<p>
					This debate shows that even the most enlightened, rational doctors tend to      argue the case of average medical professionals. However, faced with      rational, alternative arguments, they can agree to rational, practical      solutions that can emerge during a dialogue.
