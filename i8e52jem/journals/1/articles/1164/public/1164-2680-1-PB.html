					Many fears were expressed in the media when the first
					reproductive human cloning was announced. While
					this has sparked off informed debate in the western
					scientific community, in India, both the medical and the
					scientific community at large appear to be unconcerned.
					However, we must be ready for paradigm shifts in the healthcare
					system following from the insights into DNA sequences
					of human and other life forms, and the associated
					technologies that will emerge.

				<h4>Technical questions</h4>
				<p>
					From the discovery of genetic basis of diseases by Archibald
					Garrod in 1901, the sequencing of the human genome, 3
					billion long string with the resolution of a single base (A,T,G and C), is a great stride in human history <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="The human genome. Nature 2001; 409: 745-964." id="1">(1)</a>. The
					questions that this raises will be addressed by each country
					based on its perceived needs and resources. Are we prepared
					to accept the consequent challenges?
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the dawn of human society, we have tampered with
					the genetic make-up of livestock and crops to select useful
					traits. A century ago Mendel's generalised rules governing
					the mechanism of inheritance gave birth to the science of
					genetics. Eventually, in medicine the application of this
					knowledge ushered in a scientific approach to disease
					diagnostics and family counseling, a therapeutics
					revolution with antibiotics both natural and synthetic, and
					finally, following the advances in recombinant DNA
					technology, genetically engineered drugs and diagnostics.
					These occurred gradually in nearly distinct steps of
					sophistication spread over the entire 20th century.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Human Genome Project was justified largely on the
					basis of its medical benefits <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Strachen Tom and. Read Andrew P. The Human Genetics. BIOS Scientific Publisher, 1996" id="2">(2)</a>. How is this knowledge
					going to be useful to us as a developing nation? Will
					technologies emerge towards more effective and economical
					health-care practices? Can this knowledge substitute for
					current medical care practices? Where should we focus our
					limited funds for R &amp; D to optimally use this knowledge?
					Can we become equal partners in contributing to and
					utilising global technological developments of an
					altogether new type and sophistication? The medical
					profession must give serious thought to such questions.
				</p>
				<p>
					This knowledge will allow the prenatal and presymptomatic
					diagnosis of disease genes and predict an
					individual's occupational risks. The sequence of individual
					genes on structural analysis mostly in silico will tell us
					how they function and are regulated, to help us understand
					biological processes. The sequence data and analysis will
					provide the framework for new drug design and therapies
					including gene therapy in some cases. Mapping populations
					with microchip technology will allow us to conduct
					mutation screening susceptibility to diseases. This
					knowledge could dramatically change our approach to
					health care. Indeed, the Human Genome Diversity Project will study DNA sequence data from varied populations
					globally, and map diseases like thalassaemia, diabetes and
					sickle cell anaemia to determine if these are due to random
					changes in the gene pool or to adaptation to local conditions <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kline R M : Whose blood is it, any way? Scientific American 2001; 248: 42-49." id="3">(3)</a>. However, only a few diseases originating from a single
					gene defect will be amenable to gene therapy in the
					foreseeable future. Most are multi-genic and multi-factorial,
					and their complexity will not yield easily with current
					technologies in spite of genome sequence data of the highest
					accuracy <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Chapella A de La : The land between Mendelian and Multifactorial Inheritance. Science 2001; 293, 2213-2214" id="4">(4)</a>.

				<h4>The ethical dimension</h4>
				<p>
					Prenatal and pre-symptomatic diagnosis of disease provokes
					many ethical concerns. In addition, many will oppose human
					cloning. The use of embryonic or stem cells, whether normal
					or genetically altered, for medical use or research, will be
					an area of dispute. Researchers will disagree on how far
					these can genetically tampered without crossing ethical
					limits. More importantly, they will have to agree on a
					definition of consciousness and demarcate the stage of
					growth up to which an human tissue could be used for
					commercial and medical purposes. Without an informed
					debate on these issues, we may not benefit from postgenomic
					technological advances in our country.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h4>A real danger</h4>
				<p>
					In India, scientific activity has little impact on the growth
					and dissemination of knowledge. Students are taught to
					memorise facts instead of developing their analytical
					abilities. This served commercial interests; pharmaceutical
					companies influence prescribing practices by feeding
					doctors easily digestible 'capsules' on their products. The
					poor quality of genetics in medical education will keep
					our doctors captives of marketing forces.
				</p>
				<p>
					In recent history we have regressed to a state when the
					scholars managing our universities forced in astrology as a
					formal subject. As the genome sequence sets new trends in
					drug design and disease management, requiring analytical
					skills and creativity comparable to that in developed
					countries, Indian doctors could enter a similar phase of
					obscurantism if our education is not immediately
					overhauled.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors and teachers in India face an uphill task in the
					new world. With our infrastructure in IT and globalisation
					of basic knowledge base, now indeed is their opportunity
					to re-establish the high ideals of their professions both in
					research and service.
