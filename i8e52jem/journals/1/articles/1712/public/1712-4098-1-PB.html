				<p>
					Bombay's  mushrooming ICCUs (intensive cardiac care units) are 'death traps' for  unsuspecting, critically ill patients... ICCUs are misnomers at best. They form  an unchecked, unregulated, unlicensed, unauthorised and inadequately staffed  medical industry that is a farce.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically  it (ICCU) is a free-standing setup by a businessman employing a general  practitioner or a so called super-specialist in cardiology who is not  available on the premises most of the time. A sudden cardiovascular crisis,  where seconds count for survival, is never efficiently managed.
				</p>
				<p>
					As  was observed first hand, no one was seen to continuously monitor the central  station. At night the situation became deadly. RMOs (resident medical officers)  and the other staff slept comfortably while critically sick patients and the  central ICCU monitor station were left unattended.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  were told that on many occasions the RMOs and nurses 'coached' one of the  relatives to identify unusual action of the heart and were told to wake them up  if this was detected! Intravenous fluids and medications are often administered  by untrained staff with frequent, serious errors. There is no accountability  from the consultants in charge.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  public is dazzled by gadgets and machines like artificial respirators, cardiac  monitors and stress test treadmills. The fact is that those specially trained  to operate them and experienced in making quick diagnoses are not available  round the clock. Deteriorating cardiac status can never be diagnosed in time or  treated. Lifesaving medical equipment is often out of order and is prominently  displayed merely to impress the public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors  are reported to cover up each other's lapses in medical judgement and  treatment. Often the information provided to relatives is at best fragmentary  if not outright fraudulent and far removed from the patient's actual medical  status.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  individual ICCU rooms are extremely narrow spaces partitioned by curtains,  barely enough to accommodate a small bed. In the not uncommon critical  situations needing resuscitation, the adjoining seriously sick patients are put  through a frightening ordeal sharply increasing the probability of  precipitating a cardiovascular crisis.
				</p>
				<p>
					To  us it seems that the purpose of such outlets is to systematically drain public  pockets...

					(Editor's  note: Dr. Parmar's experience is not unique. It is a shame that in a metropolis  such as Bombay, we are unable to offer the care needed by seriously ill  patients in our private intensive care homes.
				</p>
				<p>
					We  welcome observations, constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement,  especially from those in private practice.)

				<h4>Aids to ethical prescribing:</h4>
				<p>
					All  of us are prone to occasional error in prescribing drugs. At times we overlook incompatibility  between two or more preparations. At others we prescribe more expensive  formulations when we could help the patient save on costs.
