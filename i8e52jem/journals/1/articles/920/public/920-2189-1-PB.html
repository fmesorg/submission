				<h4>The medical trade</h4>
				<p>
					It  is disturbing to hear the numerous revelations of malpractice and ethical  lapses committed by members of the medical profession. Technology is often  misused, with patients being made to undergo unnecessary examinations,  hospitalisation and even surgery. In many small nursing homes, doctors have  their own medical store and laboratory. Unnecessary prescriptions are issued  and no explanation is given to patients or relatives. Large multinational  pharma companies regularly supply ECG material and cardiac monitors to some  leading physicians who prescribe only their products. This unethical approach  has also infected medical colleges. Some professors convey to their students  that unethical practice is the right way to conduct oneself as a doctor.

					Recently,  I received a cheque for Rs 1200 (no. 52185525, dated March 14, 2013) from an  MRI centre with many branches in Mumbai and Pune. On enquiry, I discovered that  the cheque was by way of a "professional fee for referring a patient to the centre"  for an MRI. The patient had already paid my professional fee when I had  examined him at my hospital in Mahad. I returned the cheque, which was  reimbursed by the MRI centre to  the patient at my request by a cheque dated March 31, 2013 in the name of the  patient. On April 30, 2013, I lodged a detailed complaint against this practice  with the Medical Council of India. Until today, I have heard nothing more from  the Council. This is reminiscent of the experience of MK Mani as far back as 1995 <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mani  MK.

					In  another case, a 26-year-old married woman had been ill with fever, cough, anorexia;  and noticeable weight loss over a period of two months. Her sputum tested  positive for acid-fast bacilli, and a chest x-ray showed miliary tuberculosis.  She revealed that her mother had pulmonary Koch's disease. In spite of sufficient  evidence for a confirmed diagnosis, her physician advised a chest CT scan which  cost her Rs 4000 but did not alter the diagnosis. All this only for a  commission of Rs 1000 from the radiologist!

The conference of a physicians'  association was held at a five-star hotel at a hill station by a pharmaceutical  company to introduce a new molecule acting simultaneously on blood sugar and lipids.  Of the 120 doctors who registered as participants, 88 were provided funds for  their hotel stay and transport by the company. I refused the offer of  sponsorship and attended the conference at my own expense. At the end of the  conference, the president warmly felicitated the pharma company boss.

					As  I have been well acquainted with the practices of such companies for the last  25 years, their medical representatives and managers are not permitted to see  me.
				</p>
				<p>
					An  authority and legal adviser of my medical association told me that a company  may pay a "cut" or appoint agents and pay a commission to promote business; and  nothing is wrong with such a policy. He further advised me not to discuss this.  A wise social advocate advised me to collect a few more cases, after which he  would file a public interest litigation in a court of law.

					We  spoke personally with the manager of a nearby centre, who had sent us a Rs 500  note in an envelope for referring a patient for a CT scan. He said he did agree  with our viewpoint, but was helpless as the majority of referring doctors  wanted a "cut". Such unethical conduct has driven those doctors who believe in  practising ethically to close down their nursing homes. The cost of modern  medical treatments is beyond the capacity of the  middle class partly because of the huge expenses incurred by the healthcare  industry in sponsoring gifts, honorariums, conferences, symposia and research  grants which are eventually paid by the consumer. In today's scenario, it is  almost impossible to be a good doctor <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sheth  A.
