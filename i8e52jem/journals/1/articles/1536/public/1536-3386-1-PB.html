					I was reminded of these words written over a hundred years ago  when I heard the following on a recent visit to India.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>A friend's experience</h4>
				<p>
					A friend's wife took her young married daughter for prenatal care to a husband-  and-wifeno-hyphen team of obstetricians practising near their house in north  Bombay. The couple belonged to the same community as my friend (an assurance of  competency and personal attention?) and were highly regarded as they had  trained in Germany. Shortly into the consultation the lady doctor exclaimed  that this was obviously a tumour, not a pregnancy at all. My friend and her  daughter were shattered. The lady doctor spoke to her husband in German, the  conversation being completely unintelligible to these two ladies, scaring them  even more. She turned to the patient saying prompt surgery was essential.
				</p>
				<p>
					On returning home from work, my friend found his wife and  daughter in tears. When he heard the details he accompanied them the next day  to the nursing home and despite pressure from the doctor-couple to reserve a  room for the impending surgery, entreated them to wait. Intending to get a  second opinion, he requested a copy of the consultation report but the doctor  refused to give it, angrily saying he did not have to seek their care if he did  not trust them. My friend pacified the doctors promising to return the next day  with the necessary funds for surgery. Instead he made a frantic phone call to  an obstetrician in central Bombay who had taken care of several of his friends  and relatives. A normal pregnancy was diagnosed and, sure enough, six months  later his daughter delivered a healthy baby girl.
				</p>

				<h4>Elementary, my dear Watson!</h4>
				<p>
					The doctor's errors are glaring in this incident. Should the doctor have  pronounced a definitive diagnosis without considering other diagnoses  particularly in a situation where the pronouncement was likely to be so  traumatic? Should she/he not have ascertained the diagnosis by appropriate  tests before recommending surgery? Clearly, a written report of the  consultation should have been made available to the patient as the patient has  the right to a copy of her/his medical record which includes all notes made by  the physician and results of all tests. Finally, the patient should not have  been discouraged from getting a second opinion because a patient has the right  to consult other professionals and has the right to question the correctness of  the diagnosis and treatment plan advised by a doctor. Perhaps my friend and his  family's mistakes are less obvious. They never informed the first doctor that  the diagnosis of tumour had been questioned by the second doctor. Later they  never sent even a letter to the first doctor saying that the daughter had  delivered a normal baby. How can doctors be made to adhere to a high standard of  ethical behaviour?
				</p>
				<p>
					In the USA the doctor's code of conduct is enforced by the  regional medical societies, similar to our Maharashtra Medical Council. This  has evolved over the years to its present form due to legal and societal  pressures. Perhaps that will eventually happen in India too. Until then or as  an alternative, one could have a panel composed of experts (preferably retired  doctors who would be willing to donate their time) and representatives from the  lay public under the aegis of a neutral, respected non-governmental  organisation.
				</p>
				<p>
					This panel could investigate complaints quickly and render a  public opinion. Public scrutiny would result in loss of face for the doctor and  affect his/her practice through negative word-of-mouth advertising.
				</p>
				<p>
					Perhaps this will act as a greater deterrent than lawsuits as in  India, the judicial process is excruciatingly slow and prohibitively expensive  as lawyers don't yet have a contingency fee system. Finally, in this day of  privatisation, a for-profit business could employ medical professionals to  assess a situation and recommend a course of action, for a fee.
				</p>

				<h4>How can patients correct doctors?</h4>
				<p>
					Why was my friend so reluctant to confront the first doctor? There are many  things that stand in the way of patients bringing about a change in the way  medicine is practised in India. Firstly, the attitude of hero-worship of the  doctor that is prevalent in the society. Secondly, the paternalistic way in  which all doctors treat their patients, 'We know what is best for you. ' Thirdly,  the very idea that one can challenge authority is discouraged from childhood  onwards. Finally, the fatalistic attitude that after all complaining is not  going to redress the injury or loss, and, after all, one might need the help of  the same people tomorrow so why antagonise them today. The middle class will  have to learn to demand accountability from the system. Recognising their  common interest, the middle class will have to organise, across castes and  religions, to fight for their rights and not wait for the government or some  other body to solve all their problems.
				</p>

				<h4>Signs of change</h4>
				<p>
					People are beginning to demand compassionate and competent care from their  doctors. What often holds people back is the lack of knowledge- what are their  rights in a given scenario? How do they go about exercising those rights? One  way to encourage awareness of patients rights is through consumer organisations  dedicated to health care who can publish brochures on standards of care and  mechanisms of seeking redress when those standards are violated. Patient  support groups can promote exchange of information about care given by specific  doctors and hospitals. Since the public does not read specialised journals like <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>,  newspaper articles based on real cases of misconduct, showing step by step how  a patient can get complaints addressed, would be invaluable. Finally, the great  medium of TV could be utilised to reach even the illiterate
				</p>
				<p>
					Health care in India has become a nightmare for not only the  poor but also the well-to-do. Where the medical professional is not held  accountable, the government lacks the political will to mandate and enforce the  necessary reforms, the medical councils only too happy to let things remain the  way they are, the patients alone are going to be the engines of change.
