					The Indian Medical  Association, Academy of Medical Specialties (Karnataka Chapter) organized a  conference on 'Multispecialties: current scenario' on February 8, 2003. The  scientific sessions dealt with trauma care, imaging technology, etc. At the  banquet, along with the orchestra came four barely clad girls, suggestively  gyrating to the music. This encouraged many doctors to get on to the stage half  drunk, try to get close to the dancers and shove money into their hands. Petty  squabbles followed. That their own wives were present did not deter the  doctors.

				<h4>Corruption in medical examinations: Can students do anything?</h4>
				<p>
					Corruption in  examinations ruins the sanctity of the 'guru-shishya' tradition. When money  changes hands during the final MBBS examinations which test one's clinical  skills and will influence the health of the community-it raises questions about  the quality of doctors being trained.
				</p>
				<p>
					A variety of ingenious  means are used. Some prefer the broker system (professionals employ brokers to  collect money from hapless patients), while others prefer to do the honour  themselves. There&nbsp; have been instances where professors have sent out  unofficial notices&nbsp; declaring the amount of money to be paid for the  subject for that year. Even good students, terrified at the prospect of failing  because of not paying up, spend the days preceding the examinations trying to  find out how much and whom to pay.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following incident  took place some years ago in a government medical college before the final year  examinations. Over the preceding decade, bribery had become common. As  examinations approached, a small group of students decided to make a  difference-by not paying the bribe and by making an attempt to break the unholy  nexus that existed. A few newspaper reporters were&nbsp; contacted discreetly  and the issue was explained to them along with the need for maintaining  confidentiality. A series of news reports on the corrupt examination system  appeared in these papers over the next few days and activated the college  administration. A concerned parent sent a copy of the reports to the Medical  Council of India, which immediately faxed a letter to the principal urging her  to take necessary action. Some faculty members (including those who were in the  business themselves!) and the principal told the students not to pay up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Examiners with credible  credentials were appointed under the strict supervision of the university and  for the first time in years, a 'clean' examination was conducted. The results  were not affected in any way and the overall performance of the batch was good.  The examination continues to be free of corruption in that college to this day.  Sometimes all it requires for an unethical practice to be broken is for  somebody to stand up and refuse to be a part of the rotten system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another incident  portrays the method used by corrupt teachers to collect money. The third year  students of a dental college who were to give their internal medicine practical  examinations were approached by a broker for the external examiner. The  students were asked to get a fixed amount of money in envelopes to a busy  street near a temple. The examiner and broker waited in a car with the rear  window rolled down. The students were asked to place the envelopes in the back  seat of the car before dispersing. This gave the examiner a chance to identify  the students who had paid while apparently playing safe by not receiving money  directly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following day the  students who had left the envelopes were passed while most of those who had not  were failed. No complaint was lodged and the examiner made easy money. While it  is important that the authorities should take utmost precautions to prevent  corruption in examinations, it is also for the students not to be sucked into  the vortex of corruption.

				<h4>Transplant facts</h4>

					The Karnataka State  Authorization Committee has only rejected four out of over 2000 applications it  has received. In Tamil Nadu, a <em>Frontline</em> expos√© in July 2002 revealed that the  Authorization Committee had not kept a record of the applications received and  had only rejected one application among the scores received the previous year.  Surprisingly, the Act mentions that a record need not be kept if the  application is accepted but a detailed record has to be maintained with reasons  if the application has been rejected.
