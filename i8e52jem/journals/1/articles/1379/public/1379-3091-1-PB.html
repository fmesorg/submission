				<h4>Ethics and AIDS vaccine trials: a response</h4>
				<p>
					With regard to Professor  Sanjay Mehendale's valuable article on 'Ethical considerations in AIDS vaccine  trials' <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mehendale S: Ethical considerations in AIDS vaccine trials. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; 7(4): 13-15." id="1">(1)</a>, could I make afew critical comments? In preventive HIV vaccine  trials, any participant who gets infected as a consequence of his or her  participation in such a trial deserves the best proven HIV/ AIDS treatments,  and not only whatever is locally available. In my view it simply doesn't make  sense to suggest that triple therapy would amount to undue inducement to join  such a trial, simply because before these people joined the trial they simply  had no need for any treatment. How could providing them with the best proven  treatment possibly amount to undue inducement, given that the participant  wasn't in need of any medication before he or she joined the trial?
				</p>
				<p>
					The claim that providing  best proven therapy is not financially sustainable is an empirical claim which,  as of yet, has not been substantiated. It is being introduced by various people  with an interest in cheap access to research subjects. The recently released  latest draft of a UNAIDS document ('Ethical Considerations in HIV Preventive  Vaccine Research') essentially supports this line of reasoning, but only after  conceding that after several years of consultations with treatment access  activists and researchers from developing countries, a consensus could not be  reached. The UN organisation has taken a regrettable stance on this matter. It  allows Western researchers to avoid providing their trial subjects with the  best proven therapies in case something goes wrong during the trials they  conduct in developing countries.
