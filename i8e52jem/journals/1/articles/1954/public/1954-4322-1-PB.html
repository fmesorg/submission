				<h4>Objectivity in journals  on medical ethics</h4>
				<p>
					Exhibiting your personal opinion without fear or favour is one of the most  important principles in the review of medical ethics
				</p>
				<p>
					While reading several editions of <em>Issues in  Medical Ethics</em>, I noticed that most  articles are clearly written from a personal view. Most contributors do not  seek shelter in objectivity or refer to authorities on the matter, which is  common in the 'scientific' journals.
				</p>
				<p>
					It seems to me that the main objective of a  journal on medical ethics is to extend your own opinion by reading others,  rather than to obtain objectivity. Of course one has to obtain objectivity  concerning the factual situation, but, as a matter of fact, moral objectivity  is not always realisable. Thus, argumentation may be your only tool to reach  agreement and, as I noticed in <em>Issues in Medical Ethics</em>, this tool can be very thought-provoking.
