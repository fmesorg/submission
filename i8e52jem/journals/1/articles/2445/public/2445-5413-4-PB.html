				<h4>Healing and dying with dignity: Debating end-of-life care</h4>
				<p>
					A lot of public debate on euthanasia was parked off by the 42-year-long struggle of the nurse Aruna Shanbaug, who was in a persistent vegetative state after being brutally assaulted at her work place. The issue is complex due to the wide ranging opinions and the socioeconomic, religious &amp; spiritual dimensions of the matter at hand. With the extremely inequitable distribution of health care facilities across the country, and with no assured access to palliative care a large number of patients and their families are left in tremendous distress in such situations. On the other hand there is an ongoing public campaign to promote organ donation after brain death. The Govt of India has recently out out a draft bill on passive euthanasia seeking comments from the public. In its current form the bill is simplistic &amp; is silent on many critical areas. Therefore, there is an urgency of conversation both in academia and in the public domain from a multidisciplinary perspective.
