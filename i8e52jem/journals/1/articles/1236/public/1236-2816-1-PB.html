					The reports of deaths of children in Assam  following massive doses of Vitamin A administration during a mass campaign in  November 2001, and a similar episode in neonates in Tamil Nadu some months  earlier, have provoked extended controversy. Clearly, there is an urgent need  to formulate guidelines based on scientific and epidemiological evidence, for  the use of vitamins in general, and for massive doses of Vitamin A in  particular.
				</p>

				<h4>Administration of massive doses  of Vitamin A</h4>
				<p>
					Mass coverage of children with Vitamin A was initiated  30 years ago by the National Institute of Nutrition when keratomalacia was a  major public health problem in India. Since then, there has been a rapid  decline in the incidence of Vitamin A deficiency in the community; it is no  longer a public health problem today. Mild cases of Vitamin A deficiency do  occur in some parts of the country but they does not justify mass campaigns.  Even when mass campaigns were conducted, their limitations were known but the  campaigns were seen as a short-term emergency measure to prevent blindness.  Massive doses of Vitamin A are necessary to treat vitamin A deficiency. They  may be justified as prophylaxis only in vulnerable select groups of children.  Areas with a high prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency in children may be  considered for mass coverage. However, infants and sick older children should  not be administered massive doses of Vitamin A, because of the risk of toxic  effects.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no concrete evidence in favour of using  Vitamin A for reduction of childhood mortality. No additional dose of Vitamin A  is recommended in children suffering from respiratory infections or diarrhoea.
				</p>
				<p>
					More than 50 per cent of Indian children are  stunted and suffer from multiple deficiencies including protein-energy  malnutrition and anaemia. Vitamin A deficiency is not a major contributor to  the vast majority of these problems. More than specific supplements, what is  needed is a general improvement in diet, including green leafy vegetables and  seasonal fruits. Even if a few children do need extra doses of Vitamin A,  natural sources such as red palm oil serve the purpose better; they are  harmless and also produced in the country. Synthetic preparations, besides  being costly, must be given in precise doses and administered under supervision.  They should be reserved for specific situations.

				<h4>Analysis of the Assam  incident</h4>
				<p>
					In the first place, combining Vitamin A  administration with the pulse polio programme is a blatant violation of  scientific and epidemiological evidence. It is also against the views expressed  by the national consultation on Vitamin A.
				</p>
				<p>
					While it is necessary to cover all children under  the age of five years in the pulse polio programme, Vitamin A should not be  administered to infants less than nine months of age. Further, most children in  the community may not require massive doses of Vitamin A. It is also advisable  to avoid administering Vitamin A to sick children. Massive doses of Vitamin A  are likely to cause side effects in a few children and, if linked with the pulse  polio programme, may come in the way of successful polio eradication. For this  reason, the national consultation on Vitamin A had clearly expressed the view  that massive doses of Vitamin A were not to be used with the pulse polio  programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was reported that several children became sick  after the administration of Vitamin A, and 31 children died. The government has  stated that the deaths may have been caused by the administration of a wrong  dose, as the 2 ml spoon was replaced with a 5 ml cup as a measure.
				</p>
				<p>
					UNICEF has stated that since 1-5 year mortality is  about 7 per thousand, more than 300 children of the 3 million children covered  would have died in the week under question, regardless of the programme. They  also state that the preparation was of good quality and safe. <strong>In other words,  the deaths were not related to the administration of Vitamin A.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					The fact that  several children fell ill at the same time suggests that the Vitamin A dose  must have in some way contributed to their illness. The problem could lie  either in the large dose of Vitamin A, in bacterial contamination, or the use  of an outdated product with resulting toxicity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a healthy child, a very large single oral dose &ndash;  100,000 units of Vitamin A per kg of body weight &ndash; is considered fatal.  However, it is possible that a much smaller dose especially in an infant or  sick child could lead to fatality. Bacterial contamination seems to be  unlikely. It is anybody's guess whether the product was outdated and therefore  toxic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the exact mode of death has not been made not  clear, it is not possible at this stage to come to final conclusion without  sufficient data. Still, it is difficult to justify such a programme and one may  question the motives behind it.
				</p>
				<p>
					In view of recent events, the policy of mass  vitamin A administration to infants and children needs to be reviewed. As  Vitamin A deficiency is no longer a major health problem in the community,  there is no need to continue this universal community programme at the  risk of provoking toxic reactions. The risk-benefit ratio is in favour of the  selective use of Vitamin A supplements only to only those who have  deficiency, and not to all children in the community.

				<h4>Routine vitamin supplements to  healthy infants</h4>
				<p>
					There is enough scientific evidence that normal  new-borns on breast feeds do not require routine vitamin supplements. Further,  timely and proper weaning at about four to six months of age, coupled with  continuation of breast-feeding, ensures an adequate supply of vitamins and  minerals in the diet. It is only in select situations, such as if the neonate  is pre-term, or the child is ill, that vitamin supplements may be necessary.  Pre-term neonates are short of maternally transferred nutrients due to their  shorter than normal gestational period. It is known than breast milk secreted  by the pre-term neonate's mother cannot meet the demands of the baby  adequately, and hence routine vitamin supplementation is rational. However, not  all market preparations are ideal in composition and most of them contain  unbalanced amounts of different vitamins.
				</p>
				<p>
					Iron supplements are often necessary in children  between the age of months and three years, especially if the child's eating  habits are not well inculcated. Such children are often short of iron in the  diet and further iron absorption depends upon so many variables that only a  small proportion of ingested iron is finally available for formation of  haemoglobin. Hence, iron supplements are usually justified in that age group.  Also, it is difficult to judge iron deficiency clinically in early stages, as  symptoms are subtle and non-specific, and physical signs become evident much  later. Children presenting with pica need iron supplements, as do those who  present with breath holding spasms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Calcium supplements are not routinely required, as  milk is the main source of nutrition in infants. However, they may be necessary  in case of prolonged milk feeding with concomitant Vitamin D deficiency, in  which case supplements of Vitamin D are required along with calcium.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the case of Vitamin D deficiency, we are now  aware that such a deficiency exists in the community, probably at all age  groups, though its clinical as well as radiological manifestations vary widely depending  on the severity of deficiency. Such a wide spectrum of presentations is not  easily known and diagnosed by physicians, and hence supplements of Vitamin D  are usually administered only in case of a severe deficiency state. Minor signs  of deficiency are not picked up. There is also a myth about the abundance of  Vitamin D available from sunlight in our country.
				</p>

				<h4>Vitamins may be toxic</h4>
				<p>
					Fat-soluble vitamins such as Vitamins A,D,E and K  are stored in the body and may lead to chronic toxicity. If consumed in large  doses over a short time, they can be even fatal. Thus, supplements of these  vitamins should be used with caution. On the other hand, an excess of  water-soluble vitamins such as Vitamins B and C cannot be stored in the body,  and hence ingesting large doses may be wasted.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, routine supplements of vitamins are not  necessary for normal new-borns, infants and children. However, they are  required for normal pre-term new-borns. Otherwise supplements of vitamins  should be reserved for treatment of deficiency states or when deficiency may be  anticipated, as in case of mal-absorption syndromes.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no doubt that vitamins are overused,  especially in children who do not need the supplements. Daily supplements of  multivitamins are certainly not required in normal neonates, infants and  children on a standard feeding regime. Those who need vitamin supplements often  require therapeutic doses of vitamins to treat specific deficiencies, and are  not benefited by routine doses. The routine practice of multivitamin  supplementation to neonates is followed by most obstetricians, and hence life  for the majority starts with vitamin supplements, even when mothers may not get  proper advice on feeding. Thereafter most parents prefer to continue such supplements.
				</p>
				<p>
					I personally feel that pressure from industry is  not a major determinant of this overuse of vitamins, because vitamin  preparations are not major contributors to the pharmaceutical industry's  profits, and most doctors and parents are habituated to use them anyway. They  are used as tonics to boost appetite and health. Most doctors use these  preparations thinking that they are useful; others use them because they feel  that at least they are harmless. Amongst all vitamins, B-complex is often used  by doctors as co-prescription with antibiotics. This practice is wrongly  propagated by industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the subject of nutrition is neglected by most of  the curriculum at all levels, doctors are also poorly informed. I strongly feel  that doctors are at fault and not the industry in cases of vitamin  prescription.
				</p>
				<p>
					The national policy regarding the use of vitamins  in community programmes is restricted to the use of Vitamin A. There seems to  be a clear consensus in favour of discontinuing the mass Vitamin A supplementation  programme. Besides this, there is a need to formulate national recommendations  for the rational use of vitamins and minerals, clearly specifying the target  group which does require such supplements.
