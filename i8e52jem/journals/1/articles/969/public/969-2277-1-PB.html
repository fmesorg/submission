					In this factsheet, trials that were registered in 2011 and 2012 on the registry CTR-I have been analysed. Data for 2011 were collated up to November 2011 and up to November 2012 for 2012. 644 trials and 787 trials were found to be registered in 2011 and 2012 respectively up to the cut off date.
				</p>
				<p>
					We found 2,905 trial sites for 2011, and 3,114 trial sites for   2012. This implies a dominance of multi-sited trials. The number of   ethics committees is slightly less than the number of trials: 2,620 in   2011 and 2,778 in 2012. This implies that in some cases, one ethics   committee is issuing approvals for more than one trial site.

					It is quite clear that the gold standard for evidence generation,   the randomised controlled trial (RCT) design is the favourite study   design. There are 431 out of 644 trials in 2011, and 475 out of 787   trials in 2012 which employ this design. Use of a placebo in study   design is extensive, with 134 trials in 2011 and 149 trials in 2012.   Comparing the study molecule with an existing treatment the active   control is also equally used, with 161 trials in 2011 and 135 trials   in 2012. Please note that multiple arm trials which might employ both   the active control and placebo controls are not counted in this.  Single   arm trials are also quite preferred with 90 trials for the year 2011   and 152 trials for 2012.  It is quite intriguing to see  92 (2011) and   129 (2012) trials specified as other in study design.

					Phase 3, where there is a necessity to recruit a maximum number of   patient-participants, has the maximum number of trials (174 for 2011   and 191 for 2012). Phase 4 also has a large number of trials. It was   found that a large number of trials (193 for 2011 and 288 for 2012) are   marked as "Phase not applicable". A preliminary analysis of this section   of trials was done.  There were 46 (2011) and 41 (2012) treatment   trials in which a molecule was being tested. These also included a few   safety and efficacy trials, comparison of treatments etc. 37(2011) and   23 (2012) trials were found to be testing treatment which employs   devices, surgeries, invasive techniques, etc.
