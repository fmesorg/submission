				<h4>Questionable  ethics and confused regulation</h4>
				<p>
					Citalopram, an  anti-depressant, was administered by Sun Pharma, on daily labourers as part of  bioequivalence studies demanded by an importer. Some patients developed  complications; one of them developed gangrene as well as renal complications.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bioequivalence studies  are done establish the therapeutic equivalence of a branded product and its  generic (non-branded) version. In India there are no guidelines for  bioequivalence studies. Guidelines of the WHO, USFDA and National Institutes of  Health say that such studies should involve, in principle, adult, healthy  volunteers. To what extent underfed volunteers can be called healthy is a moot  question. Worse, it is not clear if they were adequately informed about what  they were getting into.
				</p>
				<p>
					A monograph on Citalopram  says, "The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in depression and  may persist until remission occurs. Therefore, high-risk patients should be  closely supervised throughout therapy with Citalopram hydrobromide and  consideration should be given to the possible need for hospitalisation. In  order to minimise the opportunity for overdose, prescription for Citalopram  should be written for the smallest quantity of drug consistent with good  patient management." Clearly giving Citalopram to 'healthy' people seems  to present a risk. Giving it to underfed, poor people, seems to be an even  worse choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Sun Pharma company  says the trial was part of Phase IV post-marketing surveillance (PMS). However,  PMS is done on patients who have been prescribed the drug for the said  condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					The same monograph on  Citalopram says that, "to date, no information is available on the  pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects of citalopram in patients with  severely reduced renal function." Did the patients have a history of renal  dysfunction? Did the company check?
				</p>
				<p>
					A WHO guideline on  bioequivalence studies reads, "Health monitoring, before, during and after  the study must be carried out under the supervision of a qualified medical  practitioner licensed in the jurisdiction in which the study is  conducted." The Sun Pharma medical director is quoted in the papers as  saying 'How can we be held responsible?'
				</p>
				<p>
					The researchers claim to  have taken informed consent. This is meaningless when the research subject is  non-literate, poor and otherwise weak in bargaining power.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sun Pharma claims to be  subjecting every batch or export consignment to bioequivalence studies, albeit  at the insistence of the importer. The guidelines do not mention such a  practice which is both absurd and fraught with dangers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Soon after this  controversy, Sun Pharma advertised in the newspapers asking for volunteers for  trials. Is the public entitled to know what these trials are for and which  ethical guidelines are followed? If they are for bioequivalence will the Drug  Controller explain why we need bioequivalence studies for every export  consignment? If Parliament could pass a law for the right to information  in public affairs for the country, what about the right of the public at large  to know what kind of trials are going on, on whom and for what purpose?
				</p>
				<p>
					The recent  post-liberalisation hype is to project India as a favored destination for  clinical trials. But our very advantages - a large population, genetic  diversity and low costs - are compounded by poor or no regulatory laws and  ignorance on research ethics and law among the public and even health  professionals.
				</p>
				<p>
					The application fee for  phase I clinical trials will be Rs 50,000 and the fees for both phase II and  phase III trials are just Rs 25,000 each. Many companies will of course get  'informed consent' from illiterate poor people who will be targeted with  drugs known and unknown. Citalopram is just an indicator.
