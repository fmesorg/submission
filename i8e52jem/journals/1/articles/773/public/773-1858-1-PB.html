					The  Indian pharmaceutical industry is a leading sector of the economy, with drug  companies well-represented among the blue chip shares on the stock market.  Drugs are also an integral part of medical therapy. However, in my experience  as a practising doctor and a health activist, I believe that our most important  health concerns are not because of the industry but because of a skewed health  policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a  developing country such as India, the major disease burden is of infectious  diseases. Even with the changing disease pattern the world over, infective and  environmental diseases are likely to form 50% of the disease burden. These  diseases require primarily non-pharmaceutical solutions such as clean drinking  water, a pollution-free environment and adequate nutrition. No amount of  vitamins is likely to help the patient. As for the remaining 50%, lifestyle  diseases will cost the economy dearly, unless preventive strategies are put in  place, but these preventive strategies are primarily non- pharmaceutical. For  example, the increasing incidence of diabetes and hypertension cannot be  controlled by increasing the production and marketing of insulin. While insulin  production is necessary, it must be accompanied by improving health care  education and making people aware of proper nutrition. However, we find  increasing aggressive marketing of anti-diabetic drugs with little emphasis on  preventive strategies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the medical profession cannot be  denied. This influence has increased uncomfortably over the past two decades.  Aggressive marketing, which includes offering expensive gifts and foreign  junkets, definitely increases the cost of medicines which must be borne by the  patient. It also often leads to the unscientific use of expensive, hazardous  medicines.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for  the sponsoring of medical conferences by drug companies, it is obvious that the  companies recover the money spent on these activities through increased sales  of their products. It is true that arranging a conference is a costly business  and scientific exchange of information can further the cause of medical  therapy. However, it would be worthwhile to do a study to ascertain how many  conferences generate really useful scientific debates or information and  further the cause of medical therapy.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  simplistic to blame the medical profession. Recently, it was suggested that the  Medical Council of India (MCI) should devise guidelines on the relationship  between drug companies and the profession. To involve the MCI in this  controversy is not only counter-productive considering its abysmal track record  over the past 50 years, it may open new avenues for corruption. This is not a  problem between doctors and pharmaceutical companies. Primarily, it is a  problem of India's health care policy. The definition of health, as propagated  by the WHO in its Alma Ata Declaration, is holistic. Though the Government of  India has accepted and is signatory to the Alma Ata Declaration, little has  been done to promote the spirit of primary health care. Some concrete  suggestions to ameliorate the situation are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Insist on using only the generic names of drugs. Bangladesh did this many years ago and its pharma-ceutical       industry accepted it.
					</li>
					<li>
						Avoid large conferences, and the consequent dependence on the industry for sponsorship, by increasing the       use of electronic media to exchange ideas and information.
					</li>
					<li>
						Create a fund by professional associations, with the support of the department of science and technology, to support local conferences.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove the undue emphasis on drugs in our medical educational system.
					</li>
					<li>
						Set up strict guidelines for pharmaceutical marketing practices with a watchdog body consisting of       consumer representatives.
					</li>
					<li>
						Start a debate to change the perspective and direction of health policy.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					However,  it would be na&#239;ve to expect policy-makers to implement these suggestions. In  the prevalent environment of globalisation, health care&mdash;the right of every  consumer&mdash;is being seen as a profitable business proposition, and one based on  high-technology services. The government is encouraging this perception and the  recent setting up of a Medical Tourism Council is symptomatic of the prevalent  trend. This is when deaths due to malnutrition, malaria and dengue are being  reported even from Mumbai.
