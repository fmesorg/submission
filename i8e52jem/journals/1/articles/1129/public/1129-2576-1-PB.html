				<h4>On  government service</h4>
				<p>
					I returned from England  with the MRCP in dermatology in 1951 and joined the Madras Medical Service. I  was the only assistant surgeon with a postgraduate qualification in  dermatology, yet I was kept as a reserve tutor for a record period of ten years  and shunted from department to department because I refused to approach the  authorities for a posting in dermatology. This they attributed to arrogance,  but my motives were different. I was sure of my abilities and I believed that  God had put me there for a purpose. I knew that if I approached the authorities  for a posting, it could be construed as a favour, and I might be approached  later to return the favour in ways that I would be unwilling to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					One day I was summoned  by the dean, Dr Thayumanasamy and told to take over the department from the  next day. Similarly, I was summoned one day by the director of medical  education, and asked how much money I needed to start a postgraduate course.  When I asked for only Rs 10,000, she was surprised. I bought six microscopes  for Rs 6,000, and returned the rest of the money. People came from the public  works department and offered to get me a new table, chair, etc. but I refused  all that as my existing furniture was adequate. I only asked for the walls to  be repainted. The basic rule in government service is: know your work, do your  work, and keep your hands clean.

				<h4>On  teaching</h4>
				<p>
					It is essential for the  professor to be available in the department during working hours. I began the  postgraduate class at 6 a.m. every day with no holidays. Attendance was not  compulsory, yet hardly any postgraduate student missed these lectures. At 7  a.m. we began the outpatient services. I believe that bedside teaching and  clinical demonstration are an invaluable part of training. At a meeting of the  academic council, some professors of medicine and surgery said that medical  postgraduates were mature and did not require formal teaching. The dean, a  microbiologist, was uncertain about how to respond and turned to me. I told him  that there were two wings in the medical services, the departments of medical  education and medical services. All those who were unwilling to teach should be  sent to the departments of medical services. Needless to say, I was not popular  with most of my colleagues!
				</p>
				<p>
					I believe that a  professor should not be away from the department for more than twenty-four  hours. If you are a good teacher the students will follow you everywhere. Only  about one per cent of students are bad. With them I was very stern. I keep my  needs simple. A strong spiritual attitude is helpful.

				<h4>On  private practice</h4>
				<p>
					The cost of medical  education is too high at present. Parents and students have to beg, borrow and  steal to afford the fees. After they graduate, doctors need to earn money  quickly. This encourages wrong practices. The government cannot say that it has  no money for education. It must follow such economic policies that it is  possible to provide cheap education. India has enough talented economists who  can suggest ways that make it possible.

				<h4>On  full-time versus part-time teaching</h4>
				<p>
					There is nothing  particularly advantageous about full-time teaching and stopping private  practice by government doctors. Ultimately, it all comes down to the  individual. Discipline and accountability are the most important virtues. A  person who is a full-time teacher may practice in a far-away location. When I  was in service, I fitted my practice within the time available after my duties  to the government hospital. A doctor in a teaching hospital must treat patients,  teach the students and do research. There can be no greater gift for a doctor  than the opportunity to serve mankind in a government teaching hospital.
