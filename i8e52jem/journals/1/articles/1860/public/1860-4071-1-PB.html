				<h4>Premature termination of volume two of this journal</h4>
				<p>
					By pure chance we started publication of <em>Medical Ethics</em> in August 1993. Initially intended to serve as a newsletter, we have now set our sights on graduating into a full-fledged journal.
				</p>
				<p>
					This goal will be better served if the first issue of each volume appears in January. We are therefore terminating Volume 2 with this issue. The first issue of Volume 3 will be published in January 1995.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those entitled to receive Volume 2 will now be provided all four issues of Volume 3 in 1995, in addition to the two issues in 1994, without any extra cost.
