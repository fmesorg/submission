					I [SK] am the  chairperson of the review board of medical ethics research involving human  subjects at the Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Thailand. On a  number of occasions our committee found it difficult to make a decision, so I  would like to put forward a case study for discussion to have opinions of other  experts to help us make better decisions.
				</p>
				<p>
					The study is proposed as  part of a multicentre study of a new antihypertensive drug already licensed in  a western country. The sample size would be 140 cases. The study would be  carried out in up to 20 centres in Asia with each centre studying seven cases.  The drug company would provide a protocol for every country to follow, which  contains instructions in English but very little translation in our language.  The company would provide some money for the researcher. The review board is  informed that other centres have already approved the proposal. Researchers  would not be permitted to analyse the data but would have to send it all to the  drug company who would analyse the data. There would be no meeting of  researchers nor would there be instrument standardisation, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our concerns are as follows:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						What could our  young researchers learn from these kinds of projects as the protocol will be  prepared, analysed and interpreted by the donor agency?
					</li>
					<li>
						Does the drug  company really intend to learn about the efficacy and side-effects of the drug  in Asian people and whether it is different from that in westerners? Or is it  some sort of an advertisement?
					</li>
					<li>
						Could seven  cases in each centre be enough to eradicate human bias, instrument bias, time  of measurement bias, position of the patient, age, sex, individual, lifestyle  and many other biological biases?
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Any response would be  most appreciated as we have had many protocols like this coming through our  committee.
				</p>

				<h4>Response 1: Unscientific and therefore unethical</h4>
				<p>
					I cannot offer any  comments on the scientific nature of the proposed study since protocol details are  not available. If a study is technically not sound, it is also unethical. I  hope the ethics committee has access to the full protocol. However, it is  difficult to understand the logic of having seven cases each in 20 centres,  particularly for a common condition like hypertension. Second, it is not clear  why money should be given to researchers. Is it for their time and expertise or  is it an inducement?&nbsp; What type of analysis do the researchers want to do?  Is it a double-blind study? Informing the ethics committee that other centres  have already approved the study would amount to pressure tactics. In any  multicentric study, standardisation is obligatory. I have raised several  questions for clarification. However, based on the available information given  by Professor Kietinun, such practices followed by drug companies are deplorable  and deserve to be condemned.

				<h4>Response 2: Caution is required</h4>
				<p>
					The proposed trial  raises two important issues and is typical of the kind of clinical research  that is done in developing countries. Many countries (including India) have a  provision that requires the drug controller to ask for data on clinical trials  in the country even if the drug has been approved in other countries. The  rationale for such a provision is obvious: to look for data that would factor  in local conditions such as dietary habits, lifestyle, etc. This is of  particular importance in the case of drugs for chronic illnesses as these have  often to be taken lifelong. Unfortunately, such trials are often seen as mere  formalities to satisfy regulatory requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditionally, the pharmaceutical  industry needed the academic community to do clinical trials, and the latter  was the key partner in such trials and took decisions regarding protocols,  sampling, design, etc. Contrary to this, in the last decade, we have seen a  shift where the industry employs or enrols physicians to do drug trials that  are controlled by the industry. Along with this role reversal, we also see a  growth of contract-research organisations (CROs) that undertake research on  behalf of the industry <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Bodenheimer T. Uneasy alliance&mdash;clinical investigators and the pharmaceutical industry. 2000;342:1539-1544." id="1">(1)</a>. As multicentre trials involve a large number of  sites and investigators, pharmaceutical companies now prefer to contract out  research to such CROs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second issue is the  design of the trial, a rough idea of which we can get from the sample size  proposed&mdash;140 subjects in 20 centres. Phase III clinical trials are designed to  evaluate the effect of a new drug on clinical outcomes that are of relevance to  the patient such as death, disability, etc.&mdash;which may be called 'disease  end-points'. Such trials require many participants and need to be followed-up  for a long time. For example, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment  to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) involved 40,000 hypertensive patients  followed-up for 6 years <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Davis BR, et al. Rationale and design for the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). Am J Hypertens 1996;9:342-360." id="2">(2)</a>. Thus, it may take up to a decade or more to get  reliable data about the effect of drugs on disease end-points. There is an  attempt to design trials that 'short circuit' this lengthy process by using  what are called 'surrogate end-points'. These trials evaluate the effect of a  drug not on the eventual outcome, but on specific markers such as blood  pressure, cell count, laboratory results, etc. Such trials, typically, may  involve around 100 patients and could be concluded in a few months. The logic  for doing so is that these markers are fair indicators of the final outcome.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, this is  often not true. Such short-term studies indicate that the level of certain risk  factor(s) are reduced but do not throw enough light on the eventual outcome.  For example, it has been estimated that to prevent one cardiovascular event in  a year, 120 elderly patients have to be treated for that same period. Most  treated patients will actually receive no benefit. If there are unanticipated  adverse effects, even relatively uncommon ones may minimise or eliminate the  average health benefits from drug therapy. But such adverse effects will not be  picked up by trials that only look at, say the effect of a drug in lowering  blood pressure.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, a large  trial showed that low-dose diuretic therapy was associated with a reduced risk  of coronary heart disease, but this was not true for high-dose diuretic therapy  or beta-blocker therapy <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Psaty BM, Weiss NS, Furberg CD, Koepsell TD, Siscovick DS, Rosendaal FR, et al. Surrogate end points, health outcomes, and the drug-approval process for the treatment of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. JAMA 1999;282:786-790." id="3">(3)</a>. But all three regimens lowered blood pressure.  Thus, there is the possibilty of achieving an incomplete or misleading evaluation  of a therapy when&nbsp; surrogate end-points are used to assess therapies.
				</p>
				<p>
					This does not mean that  short trials using surrogate end-points are of no value. When combined with  observational data about disease end-points they can be of value. If a drug has  already been evaluated adequately, such trials can be used to generate  additional data in different locales. However, given the relatively uncertain  significance of the outcomes of such trials, results should be treated with  extreme caution if they are sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and the data  are not available for independent evaluation.
