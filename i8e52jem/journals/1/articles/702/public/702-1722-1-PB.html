				<p>
					The following statement is based a letter to Mr A Ramadoss, Union Minister for  Health and Family Welfare, signed by 62 individuals and health organisations in  India. It was written in response to a national workshop on October 27-29,  2004, organised by Parivar Seva Sanstha in collaboration with the  government of India, UNFPA and the Packard Foundation through the Population  Foundation of India, to expand contraceptive choices with the introduction of  injectable contraceptives.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					As concerned scientists, women's groups and health activists, we are advocates  of voluntary birth control and the right of a woman to control her fertility  with safe contraceptive choices, which are user controlled. With this  conviction, for the last two decades we have opposed the introduction of  injectable contraceptives in the family planning programme.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the bid to meet unrealistic population control targets and as part of  liberalisation policies, Indian authorities have relaxed drug regulations in  order to expedite the introduction of long-acting, invasive, hazardous  contraceptives into India. This will subject millions of Indian women to  long-acting hormonal contraceptives such as injectables (Net En and Depo  Provera) and sub-dermal implants (Norplant), likely to cause irreversible  damage to their own and their progeny's health.
				</p>
				<p>
					The injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera was approved for marketing in India  in 1993 without the mandatory Phase 3 trials. The American multinational Upjohn  (since bought over by Pfizer) thus gained access to one of the largest markets  for contraceptives without following requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Women's groups, health groups and human rights groups have opposed the  introduction of injectables given the potential for abuse, non-completion of  mandatory trials and the lack of accountability of pharmaceutical agencies. An  analysis of major studies calls for a complete ban on injectable contraceptives  and particularly their introduction in the public (National Family Welfare  Programme) sphere.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Adverse  health impact</h4>
				<p>
					Severe side-effects of Net-En and Depo-Provera include menstrual disorders,  cessation of the monthly cycle or irregular bleeding, general weakness,  migraine headaches, and severe abdominal cramps. In a country where a large  percentage of women in the reproductive age suffer from anaemia, irregular and  heavy bleeding can have catastrophic consequences. Studies have shown that  injectable contraceptives like Depo-Provera can also lead to osteoporosis. This  can have grave consequences for poor women with low bone density due to poor  nutritional status. Depo-Provera has been indicted for climacteric-like  syndrome; irreversible atrophy of the ovaries and endometrium; deaths due to  thrombo-embolism; increased risk of HIV infection from an infected partner;  increased risk of Down Syndrome in babies born to women users; increased  chances of still births; increase in the risk of breast cancer, cervical cancer  including carcinoma in situ; doubts regarding the return of fertility after  discontinuation of the drug, and so on.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Inadequate  infrastructure and accountability</h4>
				<p>
					In the case against the injectable Net En, filed in the Supreme Court in 1986  against the Union of India, ICMR, DCGI and others by Saheli and other women's  groups, the government admitted at the close of the case in 2000 that mass use  of Net En in the FP programme was not advisable. This is a recognition of the  potential risks and the need for close monitoring and follow-up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Depo-Provera is hazardous for women in all circumstances. Moreover,  administration requires ruling out contra-indications and close monitoring over  long periods. Such monitoring is totally absent in this country. Poor women who  visit government hospitals where injectables would be offered in the family  planning programme would be treated as 'living laboratories'.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the NGO sector, the government of India has not evolved definitive  standards for NGOs in terms of care, follow-up or accountability. Hence, our  core concerns on women's health and safety remain unaddressed here as well.
				</p>

				<h4>Dubious  post-marketing surveillance in India</h4>
				<p>
					A five-year post-marketing surveillance study (PMS) was to have been done in  place of the final stage of clinical trials. Its results have not been made  public. In this case, post marketing surveillance has translated into private  marketing of the drug. This is hardly surprising given that PMS was conducted  by Upjohn, which profitted from the results of the research. This raises  serious doubts about the scientific objectivity of the data and its analysis.  Scrutiny of PMS data reveals that each woman user is included in the study for  five injections, three months apart. Thus, the study covers each woman user for  15 months only - though DMPA is intended as a spacing method for at least two  to three years. Further, 15 months is not adequate to assess long-term effects.  It is unscientific to declare Depo Provera as 'safe' on the basis of inadequate  data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following serious concerns remain unaddressed in the PMS:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The potential side-effect of       bone density loss and subsequent increased risk of osteoporosis has not       been studied, though the PMS had a separate budget to monitor by       densitometry. This is of great significance in India where bone density       among women is likely to be low.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cancer risk has not been       studied, though studies in other countries show that increased risk of       breast cancer -especially in younger women- cannot be ruled out.       Assessment of return of fertility has not been incorporated in the study       design - in a contraceptive being promoted as a spacing method. The effect       of DMPA on progeny conceived immediately on cessation of use of DMPA has       also not been studied.
					</li>
					<li>
						Problems such as amenorrhoea,       irregular bleeding, generalised weakness and lethargy, migraine headaches,       pain in the abdomen and severe abdominal cramps have been considered by       the researchers to be "non-serious" medical events. From a       user's perspective, these side-effects could be debilitating and hamper       daily activities and affect one's well-being. Contraceptives are targeted       at healthy women in the prime of their lives, and such side-effects cannot       be side-lined as "non-serious". Similarly, the study does not       even look into possible side-effects like mood changes, loss of hair or       loss of libido which are also of concern to women users.
					</li>
					<li>
						Breast feeding is a       contra-indication for DMPA. The administration of DMPA during lactation       could have a serious adverse effect on the health of breast feeding women       because of its association with demineralisation of bone. This is in       violation of international norms and ethics as put down by WHO and CIOMS       guideline number 11.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Many studies quoted in  favour of Depo-Provera have been scrutinised and challenged for their veracity.  We believe there is no scientific/medical justification for the introduction of  injectable contraceptives like Depo-Provera or Net-En.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr C Sathyamala in her monograph <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Sathyamala C. An Epidemiological Review of the Injectable Contraceptive Depo-Provera. Medico Friend Circle and Forum for Women's Health, Mumbai, 2000 and 2001." id="1">(1)</a> articulates the problems associated with  DMPA and concludes that it is hazardous to the health of women and their  progeny. It is not suitable for nulliparous women, adolescents, breast-feeding  women, women who have completed their family, and women in the reproductive age  group. The evidence available is already damning and it would be  unethical to subject more women to clinical trials with these contraceptives.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Drugs  Technical Advisory Board recommendation against Depo Provera</h4>
				<p>
					The recommendations made  at the Drugs Technical Advisory Board meeting held on February 16, 1995 state  that: "Depo-Provera is not recommended for inclusion in the Family  Planning Programme." N H Antia, one of the members of the DTAB, in a  separate note states why it should not be included:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The target-based approach may lead public health personnel to impose DMPA on women without checking for       contraindications or explaining hazards including permanent sterility.
					</li>
					<li>
						Because of the almost superstitious belief in the power of injections, "gullible women       would be more than willing to use this injection thus rendering themselves       vulnerable to misuse of DMPA".
					</li>
					<li>
						The health of the DMPA user has to be monitored for an array of disturbing side-effects. The Indian public health system is inadequate for this work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Up to two-thirds of women on DMPA experience menstrual chaos, which may be culturally unacceptable to       women.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Lack of informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					Right from the experience in Patancheru in Andhra Pradesh in 1985 (leading to  the filing of a writ petition in the Supreme Court), where poor, illiterate  women were recruited in clinical trials and administered the Net En injectable  without their informed consent, women's groups have monitored the violations of  informed consent while administering contraceptives. A study <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="SAMA. Unveiled reality: a study on women's experiences with Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive. SAMA, Delhi, 2000." id="2">(2)</a> reveals that  women in Delhi were put on injectable contraceptives in a public health set-up  without informed consent. Vital information regarding its safety and adverse  effects was withheld from women, depriving them of the right to make an  informed choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					The empowerment of women is not simply a matter of offering them more  contraceptive technologies without complete information, proper screening and  follow-up. The attempt to justify the introduction of injectable contraceptives  on the plea that it would provide women with a wider range of contraceptive  "choice" makes a mockery of the concept of "choice" given that  an overwhelming majority of women have no choice regarding access to health,  education or employment.
				</p>
				<p>
					We urge you to consider these issues very seriously before considering any  proposals that recommend the inclusion of injectable contraceptives in the  National Family Planning Programme. We hope you will reject the interests of  private profit and work instead to formulate a policy that ensures the overall  good for women and their progeny.
