					I read about Rene Favalaro's tragic death as a fleeting
					news item in the inside pages of the newspaper. The
					surgeon who pioneered coronary artery bypass graft
					(CABG) using saphenous vein graft had committed suicide
					on July 24, 2000, at his home in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
					He was 77 and was apparently suffering from depression.
					However, it was only some time later that the shocking details
					emerged about his suicide. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rene Favalaro: R.I.P.

				</p>
				<p>
					I did not have the privilege of meeting Dr. Favaloro for
					when I went to the Cleveland Clinic in 1973, he had already
					left for his roots. But his legend was warmly felt in the clinic's
					cardiac catheterisation laboratories and operation suites. He
					was remembered as a fine human being and as an outstanding
					surgeon. He had championed the cause of universal and
					equitable health care for his people.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was at the Texas Heart Institute as a visiting surgeon in
					1986. It was there that I came across a patient for a re-do
					coronary artery bypass operation; his coronary arteries were
					dangerously narrowed with severe blockages but the vein
					graft to the left anterior descending artery was still patent
					after 19 years; Rene Favaloro had sutured this graft with 6/
					0 silk at the Cleveland clinic in December 1967.
				</p>
				<p>
					Denton Cooley in an emotional tribute recalled Rene
					Favaloro's pioneering contributions to the coronary artery
					surgery and referred to him as an incredible inspiration. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooley Denton. Tribute to Rene Favalaro, pioneer of coronary bypass. Texas Heart Journal, 2000; 27: 231-32" id="3">(3)</a> I
					feel good that Rene Favaloro was a cardiac surgeon, a
					compassionate cardiac surgeon. Rene Favaloro's suicide
					far away in Argentina has a lesson for us in India and other
					developing countries that seem to be on a fast track towards
					globalisation.

				<h4>Globalisation and health care in India</h4>
				<p>
					With the mandatory structural adjustment policies (SAP) in
					India under the dictates of the World Bank and the
					International Monetary Fund, the government's commitment
					to public health has dropped and currently stands at less
					than two per cent of its gross domestic product. As a result,
					facilities in public hospitals have shrunk over the years.
					Lack of essential drugs and equipment, malfunctioning
					machines due to lack of maintenance, rampant corruption,
					frequent strikes and a poor work culture have all contributed
					to the decay in the public health care system. On the other
					hand, a profit-making private health care sector has grown
					at the cost of a deteriorating public sector, even as newer
					specialties and sub-specialties with rapidly changing,
					cutting-edge technologies are introduced. Hapless patients
					rush to these hospitals for services which are ensured but
					which come at a considerable cost.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is the poor who are hurt most by user charges or veiled
					attempts at privatisation being effected at public hospitals.
					Doctors trained at great expense at public hospitals leave
					these hospitals to join the private health care sector, thus directly using public funds for private gains. Many of them
					support the health services in the USA, UK, and Australia
					after training at a tremendous cost to the public exchequer.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is in this light that Favaloro's story is worth telling.
					Rene Favaloro was born to a poor family in La Plata on
					July 12, 1923. He and his brother became doctors and served
					the rural community of La Pampa. Favaloro had a natural
					bonding with his country and felt deeply and passionately
					about his people. He spent 12 years in La Pampa educating
					patients on preventive medicine, training nurses and even
					starting the first "mobile blood bank". <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Cooley Denton. Tribute to Rene Favalaro, pioneer of coronary bypass. Texas Heart Journal, 2000; 27: 231-32" id="3">(3)</a> His interest in
					thoracic surgery was sustained through this period. He went
					to the US in 1962, relatively late in his life, but his stay in the
					Cleveland Clinic from 1962 to 1971 was epoch-making.
				</p>
				<p>
					Favaloro worked closely and intently with Mason Sones,
					Donald Effler and others in the problems related to myocardial
					revascularisation. In May 1967, he and Effler did the first
					case of direct coronary artery bypass using reversed
					saphenous vein as the conduit. This single act changed the
					management of coronary artery disease forever. Favaloro
					could not have been happy that soon CABG exceeded the
					number of tonsillectomies and hysterectomies being
					performed in the US. Cardiological interventions and bypass
					operations probably hold the same 'distinction' in India
					today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Favaloro received many international awards and accolades
					from his peers honouring his imagination and innovations.
					He was made many lucrative offers but decided to remain at
					the Cleveland Clinic on a modest salary. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rene Favaloro. A revival of Paul Dudley White: an overview of present medical practice and our society. Circulation 1999; 99:1525- 37" id="4">(4)</a> Nobody would
					have blamed him if he had made his home in the USA but his
					heart was beating for his 'beloved Argentina'.
				</p>
				<p>
					Favaloro returned to Argentina in 1971. He continued with
					cardiac surgery at a private hospital initially but only to
					gather enough funds for his dream hospital where the best
					in cardiac treatment could be given to all patients irrespective
					of their paying capacity. Thus the Favaloro Foundation
					was born in 1992, incorporating the highest standards of
					research, academics, training and surgical skills, and where
					rich and poor shared the same facilities. Workers received
					the same care as did socialites. Favaloro traveled widely
					and trained a large number of cardiac specialists in the South
					Americas. His contributions to cardiac surgery continued,
					in keeping with his true scientific temper.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the meanwhile, Argentina had got trapped in the fever
					of globalisation, and large-scale lay-offs had started to claim
					workers and their unions. Large numbers of workers and
					their families were stripped of their insurance cover. Rene
					Favaloro was perhaps amongst the earliest to recognise the
					downside of such economic policies on the social sector,
					and the consequent widening gap between the rich and the
					poor. He refused to give in to the whims of market forces,
					and the poor and uninsured continued to receive the same
					treatment as always at his foundation. This put the
					foundation under heavy debts and liabilities. Favaloro
					fought the government and the corruption that the system had brought in. It is said that his institution was under a $70
					million debt. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Feiola A. Doctor's suicide strikes at heart of Argentina's health care crisis. Washington Post; August 25, 2000." id="2">(2)</a> Favaloro, who had returned to his native
					Argentina to champion the cause of universal health care,
					was disillusioned with the reforms as only the affluent were
					enjoying what he once called "the right to live." He blamed
					globalisation and the free-market revolution of the 1990s for
					"a growing callousness" toward health care for the poor. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rene Favalaro: R.I.P. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; VIII (4), 112." id="1">(1)</a>
					Financial difficulties and governmental pressures broke the
					will of this colossal figure but could not reduce his love and
					compassion for his people.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is beautifully illustrated by his message to his staff,
					only days before he decided to put the bullet through his
					heart. "I have always practiced medicine with a profound
					social pledge. For me, all patients are equal. This foundation
					is for everyone. Every patient, paying or not, will continue
					receiving the same attention." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Feiola A. Doctor's suicide strikes at heart of Argentina's health care crisis. Washington Post; August 25, 2000." id="2">(2)</a> Favaloro made a strong
					social statement through his suicide and we need to hear
					that statement loud and clear. His love for his people,
					especially the poor, and his distress when he could not help
					them, should be a wake-up call for the smug and uncaring.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rene Favaloro's death touches the poor and the
					marginalised not only in the poor countries but even in the
					US. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Rene Favaloro. A revival of Paul Dudley White: an overview of present medical practice and our society. Circulation 1999; 99:1525- 37" id="4">(4)</a> His story must shake not only cardiologists and
					cardiac surgeons but the entire medical community. It must
					also be told repeatedly to governments, sociologists,
					economists and industrialists. It may not be prudent to undo
					the reforms but their direction can be controlled so that the
					poor do not lose out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Technological advances in medicine and science have
					presented tremendous opportunities for human
					development, and it will be indeed foolish not to use these
					for the betterment of our people. But science also teaches
					us to be rational and not to accept things blindly.
					Unfortunately the noble pursuit of science has been hijacked
					by business interests, and that too in the name of health
					care. The free market economy and globalisation have only
					aggravated the gap between poor and rich countries, as
					also amongst people in the same country. One fifth of the
					world's richest have an income more than the combined
					incomes of four-fifth of humanity in the least developed
					countries. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Program Report 1998. Oxford Press, New Delhi, 2000." id="5">(5)</a> Further, 50 to 60 billion US dollars are spent in
					the research and development of diseases that interest the
					developed world. Only one-tenth of research funds is spent
					on diseases affecting developing countries. This 10/90
					disproportion has attracted the attention at last of concerned
					individuals and organisations. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="United Nations Development Program Report 1998. Oxford Press, New Delhi, 2000." id="5">(5)</a> Even the World Bank talks
					of reforms with a human face.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors may not think it necessary to get embroiled in
					economic issues but it is time that they step out of their
					ivory towers and recognise the important link between
					poverty and disease. Unfortunately, the connection between
					poverty and the disease is never taught in medical schools.
					There, training is limited to exotic diseases and complex
					strategies in their treatment. In due time the training becomes
					an "attitude" and traditional knowledge as well as simple
					and economical treatments are relegated to the status of
					fringe remedies; history taking and physical examinations
					are discarded in favour of costly investigations and even
					marginalised as orthodox. In the process, the poor have no options, and since they are at their most vulnerable, they
					are victims of artificially created demands of vested interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Technology comes at a tremendous cost; unfortunately it
					is very heady and addictive. The twentieth century saw
					technology mushroom and medical care costs escalate
					twenty fold. Most recent technology in medical science is
					an off-shoot of defense technology, and its emergence in
					developing countries with the end of the cold war cannot be
					co-incidental. Gullible doctors, dazzled by technology and
					mega-bucks, unwittingly became partners to the free mixing
					of medicine and business. This is perhaps most grotesquely
					conspicuous in my own specialty of cardiology and cardiac
					surgery. Industry, media and doctors have become silent
					partners in the greed perpetuated by an increasing
					consumerism. As doctors we need to remember that twothirds
					of our people live in villages and support the lifestyles
					of the urban rich while they themselves live in abject poverty.
				</p>
				<p>
					It will do a real honour to Rene Favaloro's memory if the
					medical community can continue the crusade started by him
					to ensure an equal and universal health care for all. Rene
					Favaloro, a hero when alive, will continue to shine like a
					bright star even after his death.
