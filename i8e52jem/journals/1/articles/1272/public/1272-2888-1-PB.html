					The National Health Assembly (NHA) in Calcutta on
					November 30 and December 1, 2000, and the People's
					Health Assembly (PHA) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from
					December 4 to 8, 2000, represent milestones in the growing
					opposition to current global inequalities and their
					consequences on people's health and health care. It is hoped
					that this will lead to a consistent campaign against
					globalisation and a national dialogue on health and health
					policy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both meetings were preceded by months of preparation.
					According to the organisers of the Indian programme, for
					the first time organisations of drastically different
					perspectives came together on a common platform, to put
					together one the most successful of country efforts. Starting
					in February, block and district enquiries involving more than
					1,000 local organisations collected a mass of information
					and commentary on people's health care need and the
					currently available health services.
				</p>
				<p>
					On November 29, delegates from all over the country started
					pouring into Calcutta in 'people's trains' (over 1,000 people
					came to the meeting from outside West Bengal). The travellers
					were enthused by the experience of sharing their experiences
					with each other during the journey to the meet.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the inauguration, economist Amiya Bagchi spoke on
					the implications of the globalisation process for people's
					health. Dr Hafden Mahler, director-general of the World
					Health Organisation at the time that the historic Alma Ata
					Declaration was approved in 1978, recalled that the
					Declaration was unanimously approved by member
					countries. It asserted universal primary health care as a right,
					and committed member countries to provide health for all by
					the year 2000. However, this commitment was quickly
					forgotten as structural adjustment programmes demanded
					by international lending institutions forced governments to
					cut back on social sector spending, and economic policies
					imposed by these institutions increased unemployment,
					work insecurity and poverty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Representatives of the 20 participating organisations
					presented solidarity messages at the plenary session which
					was followed by 20 parallel workshops on a range of issues
					from medical professional regulation and community health
					workers to rational drugs and the World Trade Organisation.
					The next day, parallel sub-conferences presented case
					studies and reports gathered during the NHA process, and
					also discussed policy changes, community based initiatives,
					the decentralisation of health care and the role of
					panchayats.
				</p>
				<p>
					The People's Health Charter, adopted by the NHA at the
					conclusion of the meeting, reaffirmed the right to
					comprehensive health care and other social services. The
					20-point list of demands includes comprehensive primary
					health care, an infrastructure controlled at the panchayat raj level, an increased government commitment to health care,
					reversing the trend of health service privatisation, regulating
					the private sector, a rational drug policy, priority setting in
					medical research, abolishing coercive contraceptive policies,
					and support to traditional systems.
				</p>
				<p>
					More than 1,200 people from 93 countries registered for
					the People's Health Assembly in Savar, near Dhaka,
					Bangladesh, from December 4 to 8, 2000. The programme
					began with a meeting at the Martyrs' Memorial monument
					where the PHA 2000 participants pledged to fight for the
					goal of health for all throughout the world. Morning plenaries
					over the next five days presented case studies on the impact
					of inequality and poverty on health, the status of health
					care and health services, environment and human survival
					and the way forward. In the afternoons, concurrent
					workshops were held on a range of health-related issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Iraqi and Cuban delegations called for lifting of US
					sanctions on their countries. In Iraq, the destruction of
					infrastructure by the US embargo was partly responsible for
					a 660 per cent increase in infant mortality rate. The Cubans
					stated that the country's focus on primary health care and
					social welfare was responsible for the general good health
					of its people, though the US embargo cost the country dearly.
					From Kerala, Mr Govinda Pillai noted that the successes of
					this economically poor state with the highest social
					development indicators in the country were achieved
					through mobilisation of the people, but that the Kerala model
					is under threat as cuts are being called for by international
					funding agencies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The third day of the PHA was probably the most
					contentious, when World Bank representative Richard
					Skolnick defended his organisation's health-related projects
					in poor countries. He was met by a largely hostile audience,
					and his presentation was followed by a series of speakers
					who attacked the Bank's policies as well as the general trade
					environment in which it functioned. The next day, panelists
					focused on the World Trade Organisation's role in
					converting health into a commodity. The Trade Related
					Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement would make
					medicines even costlier than they are now. Dr Zafar Mirza of
					the Network for Consumer Protection in Pakistan said that
					TRIPS would make essential drugs unaffordable to the poor.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the closing day of the PHA, the People's Charter for
					Health, which had been discussed throughout the PHA,
					was presented and adopted by the assembly. The Charter
					outlined the economic basis of the health crisis faced today
					and asserted the principles on which it was based: health is
					a fundamental right to be assured by governments, with the
					1978 Alma Ata Declaration as the basis, people's
					participation must take place at every level. As with India's
					People's Charter, the demands of the international charter
					made it clear that achieving the fundamental right to health
					is part of a comprehensive change in every sphere of life
					from international trade, agricultural policies, political
					systems, environment, and health care systems.
