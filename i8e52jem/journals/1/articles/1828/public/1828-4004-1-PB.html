					The Center's primary publication is The Hastings Center Report - a long established bimonthly journal that now serves as a source of references to so many. One encounters papers by philosophers, legal experts, medical personnel, social scientists, students of the natural sciences and theologians. Through the courtesy of Dr. Daniel Callahan and his team, Forum for Medical Ethics Society has received three volumes of this publication (see section on Gifts). The Center also publishes IRB: A review of human subjects research once every two months. Cumulative indices to both these are available on 5.25 inch floppy disks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Several special supplements to The Hastings Center Report have been published over the years including those on Theology, Religious Traditions and Bioethics; Animals, Science and Ethics; Mercy, Murder and Morality; Perspectives on Euthanasia; Genetic Grammar and AIDS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Publications on audio-tape include Living with mortality, The nature of suffering and The future of medical education and Medical futility: the limits of patient autonomy.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Center also published books, monographs, handbooks under its own imprint, under the imprint of Plenum Press and, more recently, under that of The Georgetown University Press (see below) and other University presses and publishing companies.
