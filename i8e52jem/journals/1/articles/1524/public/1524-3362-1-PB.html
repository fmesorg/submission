				<h4>Put yourself in the patient's shoes</h4>
				<p>
					I was  very pleased to read the article by Sarita Agrawal <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Agarwal Sarita: From the other side. Issues in Medical Ethics 1999; VII (3): 94-95. " id="1">(1)</a>. I am glad that  articulate patients like her are finally making their voice heard.

					Sometimes  doctors forget that the centre of the medical universe should be the patient &ndash;  and not the doctor. Such articles, which describe the patient's viewpoint, can  help doctors to become more empathetic and caring. After all, putting yourself  in the patient's shoes can only improve your perspective for the better.  Patients in the West are becoming increasingly vocal, and are letting their  doctors know what they want, and since they can speak with their wallets, their  voices carry a lot of clout. This is all for the best. The ultimate aim of the  doctor is to help the patient.

				<p>
					Industries  all over the world are becoming more consumer-responsive: the customer is  king. While the medical profession is the ultimate service industry,  unfortunately in India, doctors have lagged behind in putting the patient's  interests first. It is all too common to see doctors being rude or arrogant;  and many routinely make patients and their relatives wait endlessly. Such  rudeness would be unpardonable in any other sector, so why do Indian patients  allow doctors to get away with it? The raison d'etre for a doctor is his  patients, and if patients refuse to put up with bad behaviour, the entire  medical profession will, one hopes, improve.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately,  medical students have few role models they can emulate. The tragedy is that we  need to be told to pull up our socks by our patients. I do hope doctors will  improve. Remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do  unto you.
