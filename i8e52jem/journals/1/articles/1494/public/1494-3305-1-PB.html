				<h4>'Evidence-biased therapy'</h4>
				<p>
					Regarding our article <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kothari Manu et al : Ethics and evidence-based therapy, Issues in Medical Ethics, 1999; 16-18." id="1">(1)</a>, and Meenal Mamdani's critique of it <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Mamdani M : Anecdotes do not make evidence. Issues in Medical Ethics, 1999; 7:36." id="2">(2)</a>, our article  ought to have been titled 'Evidence-biased therapy' just to drive home the  simple fact that modern medicine with all its diagnostic/therapeutic wizardry,  treats, according to its knowledge of cancer, merely some evidence and nothing  save the evidence.

The therapeutic restraint that the authorities quoted here  emphasised was more than vindicated by the candour of Nobel laureate Pauling <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pauling L : Quoted by Moss RW : The Cancer Syndrome, Grove Press, NY, 1980 Front Cover." id="8">(8)</a>: <em>"Everyone should know that the war on cancer is largely a fraud,  and that the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society are  derelict in their duties to the people who support them"</em>.

					All  cancer therapy is glorified palliation <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kothari ML and Mehta Lopa A : The nature of Cancer (Bombay: Kothari Medical Publications, 1973)." id="9">(9</a>, <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Kothari ML and Mehta LA : Violence in modern medicine. In, Science, Hegemony, and Violence, (Ed:Nandy A), OUP, Oxford, 1988." id="14">14)</a>, the chief raison d'etre of which  is to ease if there is disease. Our Mrs Kothari had a large lump but no disease  so she was profitably left alone. The other patient was sailing in the same  boat, but her well intentioned doctors chose to "attack" her disease less  tumour and forthwith dispatched her to her maker. Dr Mamdani should see the  evidence that this small controlled trial provides.

					Leslie  Foulds <a class="reference" href="#fifteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Foulds L : Neoplastic Development. I. Academic Press, London, New York, 1969.7" id="15">(15)</a>, the noted oncologist and author who died of undiagnosed, advanced  colonic cancer, classified cancers into 'good' and 'bad', but on a  retrospective basis, depending on how they behaved post-treatment. The many  parameters that cancer doctors are searching for to help them predict the  behaviour of a particular tumour are just not there. That being so, it is good  to follow a general rule: <em>"When in doubt, don't"</em>.
