					The Q in QPMPA stands  not for Quilon but for Qualified. The Qualified Private Medical Practitioners  Association now has a web site, <a href="http://qpmpa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.qpmpa.com/</a>

				<h4>Not an ethical issue</h4>
				<p>
					In reference to Geetanjali Gangoli's report on the National Health  Services <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Gangoli G: National health services: imminent collapse. Issues in Medical Ethics 2000; VIII (3): 97." id="1">(1)</a>, we should be least concerned about the problems of the NHS other  than noting that such a system, like all socialistic systems, cannot survive in  a demanding capitalistic environment. To expect the government to provide  quality services encompassing the entire gamut of modern medicine at a  disproportionate cost compared to the private sector, is absurd.
				</p>
				<p>
					Concerning the proposal to send patients to India, we need to look at its  ethical, legal and economic aspects.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ethically, I doubt if such a transfer of patients violates any ethical  principle. Legal issues may be complex and need careful evaluation. If a  malpractice suit is filed while the patient has an adverse reaction during the  flight, or in the parent country long after the procedure, it may be difficult  to determine errors in practice, and even more to settle claims. Standards of  care may vary from country to country and may need more precise definition.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for the economic aspects, I doubt if patients arriving in India from the UK  can exploit our private medical enterprise. It has never happened with patients  coming from the Gulf. In fact, the reverse may be true. From past experience,  patients coming from the Gulf were exploited systematically starting with taxi  drivers at the airport to touts and ward boys at major hospitals. Hospital  administrators, doctors, nurses and laboratory services had a hey day with each  taking a slice of the Gulf pie.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have no reason to believe that we have changed in the past decade. The state  may have to enact laws to protect foreign patients against exploitation. As far  as foreign patients reducing Indian patients' access to care, these numbers  would be so small that the private sector easily accommodates them. They are  unlikely to make a dent in our vast medical service.
