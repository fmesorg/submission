				<h4> Stop  press: a landmark judgment </h4>
				<p>
					On  September 4, 2001, the Bombay High Court held that accredited members of the press shall be  permitted to attend inquiry proceedings conducted by the  Maharashtra 	Medical Council to probe misconduct of medical  practitioners. 	" ... MMC cannot hold the view that inquiry proceedings  held under Section 	 	22 of  the MMC Act of 1965 are confidential in nature and have to be held  in 	camera." <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Indian Express, October 22, 2001." id="2">(1)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The judgement was  in response to a case filed in the early 1990s, by Ms. Saroj Iyer, journalist;  the Medico Friend Circle Bombay Group; The Forum for Medical Ethics Society and  Lok Hith. The case was filed in relation to a complaint by Mr. PC Singhi to the  MMC, against Dr. Prafull Desai, surgeon at the Bombay Hospital. The MMC judged  Dr. Prafull Desai guilty of two 	 	misconducts, but  was punished only with a warning. Ms Saroj Iyer, who was also active in the  MFC, was not 	 	allowed to witness the proceedings. This  judgement will be an important precedent for the presence of witnesses in  Medical Council Inquiries. If a journalist is allowed, it should not be  difficult for doctors and laypersons to claim the right to witness an inquiry.  Are there any takers for such legal action?
				</p>
				<p>
					Three  precendent-setting high court judgments have emerged from MFC's (Bombay Group)  campaign on medical malpractice: on registration and standards in private  nursing homes (following from the case involving Ms. Yasmin Tawaria), the  patient's right to a copy of medical 	 	records (Mr.  Raghunath Raheja), and, now, allowing journalists 	to witness an MMC  inquiry against doctors (Mr. PC Singhi).
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Singhi's long  fight in the civil and criminal courts is still on, and he has won several  battles here. Some of these rulings are also precedent setting, and can be used  by others. Some have been described in the book documenting MFC's work in  Mumbai:<em>Market, medicine, malpractice</em>.
