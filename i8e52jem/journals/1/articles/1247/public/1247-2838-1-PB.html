				<h4>Gujarat's inhumanity</h4>
				<p>
					Lack of medication is believed to have led to the  deaths of at least four people at the Shah Alam Dargah, one of the four safe  houses in Ahmedabad. The victims could not be shifted to a hospital because  there was no government official to give them cover from the mobs. Nor could  government doctors be brought to the safe house.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are very few doctors with very little  equipment and drugs in the safe houses. Most people here have burns, fractures  and abrasions while serious cases are clandestinely sent to hospital in private  ambulances.
				</p>
				<p>
					432 additional OPDs have been created at state  hospitals after the riots broke out, but fear of the mobs has forced most  Muslims to rush back to the safe houses after getting preliminary treatment.  But the safe houses have not been able to provide follow-up treatment, leading  to deaths.

				<h4>Social responsibilities forgotten</h4>
				<p>
					In stark contrast to the response to the earthquake  in 2001, not one of hundreds of NGOs and corporates helped the thousands  rendered destitute and homeless by the communal riots in Gujarat. Individuals  went to hospitals and relief camps providing food, clothes and medicines.  Fifteen relief camps, in Ahmedabad alone, provided shelter to over 50,000  displaced persons but hardly any NGO [of over 300 NGOs] came forward during the  first four to five days when help was most urgently required However, the  smaller NGOs like the St Xaviers Social Service Society, the Citizen's  Initiative, the Kamdaar Swasthya Suraksha Mandal and the Shah Alam Islamic  Trust first ventured into the burning city to provide assistance to the  victims.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even pharmas, including Torrent, Cadila, Zydus  Cadila, Core and Intas, made no attempts to reach out to the victims with free  medicines.

				<h4>Exceptions to the rule...</h4>
				<p>
					When most of Gujarat was afflicted by the madness,  staff at the state-owned Civil Hospital in Meghaninagar did yeoman service,  rescuing the injured, irrespective of their religious affiliations.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Those who killed innocents, either in Godhra  or in Ahmedabad, did what they thought their religion was. I went by my  religion and saved them," says Dr Prashant Baranwal.
				</p>
				<p>
					"We were coming to do our job, but there was  something definitely wrong in the air. In these circumstances, anyone could be  carried away," says nurse Anushka.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, ultimately, good sense prevailed in  "all of us", says Sister R D Patel and adds, " this is the  sanctity of our profession".

				<h4>Communalism and doctors</h4>
				<p>
					Following an attack on a doctor in a  minority-dominated area, the Ahmedabad Doctors Forum has appealed to doctors  practising in the areas and hospitals run by minority trusts to stop their  practice if they are not provided security. The forum founder, Dr Bharat Amin,  said that doctors practising in such areas were not provided any protection and  their life was not safe. Therefore, they should stop their practice. Meanwhile,  the BJP doctors cell President, Dr Anil Patel, has demanded action against  those involved in assaults on doctors. "A noble profession should not be  discriminated on the basis of religion," he added

				<h4>A challenge to doctors</h4>
				<p>
					A doctor in rural Vadodara said that the wounded  who started pouring in from February 28 had injuries of a kind he had never  witnessed before, even in earlier situations of communal violence. In a grave  challenge to the Hippocratic oath, doctors have been threatened for treating  Muslim patients, and pressurised to use the blood donated by RSS volunteers  only to treat Hindu patients. Sword injuries, mutilated breasts and burns of  varying intensity characterised the early days of the massacre. Doctors  conducted post-mortems on a number of women who had been gang-raped, many of  whom had been burnt subsequently.

				<h4>Effects of war in Sri Lanka on  health</h4>
				<p>
					Staff members of the international relief  organisation Doctors Without Borders describe the physical and mental health  consequences of conflict in Sri Lanka where more than 64,000 people have died,  and hundreds of thousands displaced, in a 19-year-old civil war. The displaced  are settled in government-run camps. "The desperate living conditions, and  the general level of trauma within the population, is reflected by the alarming  rate of suicide in the camps, which is almost three times higher than in the  community." There are few doctors, and low access, availability, and  quality of health care. The living conditions in the welfare centres must be  improved and the acute psychosocial and practical needs of the population must  be addressed by the authorities.

				<h4>Palestinian health workers  harassed</h4>
				<p>
					The World Medical Association condemned the  targeting and harassment of health workers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Since April, 28 Palestinian Red Crescent Society workers have been detained by  Israeli forces. Three ambulance crews were arrested shortly after leaving their  station on an emergency call. The society's president, Younis Al-Khatif, was  arrested with them. The ambulance crews and Al-Khatif were released the next  day after protests from other national Red Cross and Red Crescent  organisations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Six more of the Red Crescent Society's paramedics  were arrested while tending sick and injured people in the West Bank city of  Jenin, which was closed off by order of the Israeli defence forces. Israel  claims that the society's ambulances have been used to smuggle weapons,  although no charges have been brought in any of the arrests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Three workers with the Palestinian Red Crescent  Society have been killed since the Intifada began, and 140 have been injured.  On March 4, the head of emergency medical services in Jenin was killed when two  of the society's ambulances were allegedly fired on by Israeli soldiers in a  nearby building. Five other health workers were wounded in that attack.  Witnesses claimed that the soldiers fired on paramedics trying to reach their  colleagues trapped in the burning ambulances. One UN ambulance man has also  been killed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Israeli humanitarian ambulance service, Magen  David Adom, and the Palestinian Red Crescent Society have issued joint  statements declaring their condemnation of all attacks on ambulances and their  determination to keep treating the sick and injured irrespective of their  nationality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Avi Zohar, director general of Magen David Adom,  said that four workers with his organisation have been killed and 11 wounded  while performing humanitarian work. On March 31, a Palestinian suicide bomber  detonated a bomb inside a Magen David Adom ambulance station in Israel,  wounding four staff.

				<h4>Doctors against war</h4>
				<p>
					Doctors in India and Pakistan are campaigning  against the threat of nuclear war between the two countries. The campaigns have  been spearheaded by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear  War (IPPNW) and its affiliates. The IPPNW wrote, in a letter to the Indian  prime minister, AB Vajpayee, and the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf,  that the countries' nuclear arsenals are "capable of destroying both  countries as functional societies." The letter cautions that there can be  no effective medical response to the catastrophe that would follow a nuclear  attack on cities such as Mumbai or Karachi.

				<h4>Punjab's sex determination  problem</h4>
				<p>
					Fatehgarh district ( Punjab) has the dubious  distinction of having the lowest child sex ratio in the country. The Akal Takht  - the highest seat of spiritual and temporal authority amongst Sikhs - issued a  diktat on April 6 2001 prohibiting pre-natal sex determination and threatening  violators with social boycott and excommunication.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the Supreme Court directed all states to  implement the Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of  Misuse) (PNDT) Act, 1994, the Punjab government registered 14 cases over the  next few months.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Haryana, the focus has been on unscrupulous  doctors and not on the women who are themselves victims of family pressures  whereas in Punjab, it is the women themselves who are being targeted.

				<h4>New ethics body for developing  world</h4>
				<p>
					Strategic Initiative for Developing Capacity in  Ethical Review (SIDCER) will be a new central fund-raising and communications  body for regional fora seeking to implement new ethical standards in clinical  trials in the developing world. SIDCER began as part of the WHO's Tropical  Disease Research department, and led to the development of several regional  ethical and educational for a in Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is hoped that the network will help avoid  repeats of past claims of unethical practices in third world countries,  particularly with respect to AIDS drug trials in Africa. This has PR relevance  as well as commercial ramifications

				<h4>Ethical issues in ECT</h4>
				<p>
					A voluntary organisation, Sarthak, has urged the  Indian Supreme Court to ban the use of ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) without  anaesthesia in mentally ill patients. It also seeks to make informed consent  mandatory in all ECT procedures. Patients received minor and occasionally  severe injuries while receiving ECT without anaesthesia.
				</p>
				<p>
					Advocates of ECT argue that its practice in India  is defensible because many organisations lack anaesthesia facilities, are not  attached to hospitals and have no anaesthetists on call. Doctors campaigning  against ECT without anaesthesia say the lack of infrastructure is an  unacceptable excuse.

				<h4>Virginity not a medical issue</h4>
				<p>
					The Spanish conservative party Partido Popular has  urged the Andalusian government to make it illegal for doctors in the  Andalusian health service to issue virginity certificates. The prohibition  should be observed "even when the patient is under age and accompanied by  her parents."
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr Jaume Padrós, secretary of the Official Medical  College of Barcelona, noted that the aim of medical certificates was to certify  "health states," and whether a woman was a virgin was not a medical  condition.

				<h4>Learn - and earn!</h4>
				<p>
					A new American company called Time-Concepts LLC offers  doctors $50 each time they listen to a medical representative's sales pitch. Of  the $105 that the company receives from the drug manufacturer per consultation,  $50 goes to the doctor, $5 to a charity and $50 to itself.
				</p>
				<p>
					Doctors are accepting the payments, despite the  guidelines from the American Medical Association specifying that they should  not accept cash payments from drug companies. Some claim that this helps them  control when and how to talk to the representatives as well as to get drug information.  An AMA spokesman points out that if the purpose of the contact is to educate  the physician, then there is no need to pay the physician

The Pakistan Medical Association, the largest professional body of doctors  in Pakistan, began leading a wave of protest strikes ...The delivery of medical  care in the city has suffered...It goes against the ethic of our profession,  but we are desperate and scrambling...Because a particular religious sect has  been targeted, the origins of the attacks may well be in religious extremism...
