					Domestic violence is becoming recognised as a serious public health issue.  Country studies have shown that between 16 and 40 per cent of women in the Asia  and Pacific region had suffered violence by their intimate family members. <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abdullah R. Indicators of women's mental health and well-being. Arrows for Change 2001; 7 (3): 12." id="1">(1)</a> The medical profession must be sensitised to provide special support services  to the victims of this violence who are predominantly women and children. One  initiative in this regard was a collaboration between the Mumbai Municipal  Corporation and the Centre for Enquiry Into Health and Allied Themes to set up  Dilaasa, a crisis centre for women, in the municipality-run Bhabha Hospital,  Bandra. <a class="reference" href="#two" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Abdullah R.

Arrows for Change 2001; 7 (3): 12." id="2">(2)</a> Also, a recently published study has documented the various  approaches of mental health professionals and support groups providing refuge  to the victims of domestic violence in India. <a class="reference" href="#three" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="International Centre for Research on Women.

					Depression caused by  domestic violence is manifested in a range of physical and psychological  symptoms. On marriage, women routinely lose access to various social networks  and family support systems which might have sustained them and enabled them to  respond effectively when faced with domestic violence.

				<h4>Perspectives on mental health</h4>
				<p>
					The words 'etic' and  'emic' are of Latin origin, and refer to monolithic and pluralistic  perspectives or analytical frameworks. Medical anthropologists and social  psychologists have borrowed these words from anthropology to describe  approaches to mental illness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The universalist or etic  approach uses diagnostic categories such as neurosis, schizophrenia, psychosis,  mania, phobia and paranoia. Such labelling does not take cognisance of the  physical, sexual or psychological violence that women may experience and cope  with on a daily basis. This medicalisation of mental health as expressed in the  Draft National Health Policy 2001-III has been criticised because it further  victimises the victim. <a class="reference" href="#four" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Davar B. Draft National Health Policy 2001-III, mental health: serious misconceptions. Economic and Political Weekly 2002; XXXVII (1): 20-22." id="4">(4)</a> Also, the current dependence on pharmacological and  shock therapy has many undesirable consequences.
				</p>
				<p>
					The emic approach  evaluates the phenomenon of mental illness in its cultural context. This could  include a community intervention strategy to provide security to victims of  domestic violence. Culturally sensitive counselling takes into consideration  women's personal predicaments in a specific socio-cultural environment. Such an  approach has enabled state protection to victims of domestic violence and the  enactment of statutory provisions to safeguard their interests. There is also  evidence of the efficacy of approaches such as hypnosis, supportive therapy,  re-education, desensitisation, group psychotherapy, family therapy and  psychoanalysis. <a class="reference" href="#five" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shertzer B and S. Fundamentals of counselling. Houghton Miffin Co, Boston, 1968, p 14." id="5">(5)</a>

				<h4>Power relations in mental health treatment</h4>
				<p>
					The relationship between  the medical professional and the person seeking support is an unequal one. In  the case of women, this inequality is compounded by the subjugation of women by  a patriarchally structured psychiatric system. Because of the biomedical nature  of psychiatry, and the focus on treating symptoms, mental health professionals  do not take into consideration the power relations within which women live. A  diagnosis of mental illness might be a way of labelling people as ill and  treating them as impersonal objects, <a class="reference" href="#six" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Noonan E. Counselling young people. Methuen, London and New York, 1983, p 48." id="6">(6)</a> ignoring the impact of socio-cultural  and socio-demographic factors.
				</p>
				<p>
					In India, there is  little evidence of preventive and promotive efforts in mental health. This  marginalisation of mental health concerns results from the understanding that  mental distress is a manifestation of an individual problem and not directly  related to social oppression. <a class="reference" href="#seven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Vindhya U, A Kiranmayi and V Vijayalaxmi. Women in psychological distress: evidence from a hospital based study. Economic and Political Weekly 2001; XXXVI (43): 4081-4087." id="7">(7)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The experiences of  support groups have revealed the value of individual counselling by  professional counsellors in a non-threatening environment. At the same time,  through mutual counselling, women with similar experiences can empower each  other by narrating their problems and finding solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mainstream mental health  professionals are often unable to provide women with the counselling they need.  A stereotypical understanding about women's role in the family and society  governs their psyche. If the 'mentally ill' woman does not fit in that mould,  she is declared 'socially incompetent'. Mainstream counselling can also  reinforce the subordination-domination relations between men and women.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ethical duties</h4>
				<p>
					Women can face domestic  violence for breaking traditional barriers imposed by a male chauvinist value  system that has mental health consequences. Professionals must realise that  their ethical duty is to empower the victim, not to marginalise her by declaring  her 'mentally unfit'. Sexual abuse whether by family members or others has  serious psychological consequences. Mental health practitioners who are aware  that a patient is a victim of such abuse are ethically bound to help her move  out of that situation, rather than using chemical therapy to treat the  symptoms.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inmates of shelters for victims of domestic violence need a democratic space  for brainstorming and finding avenues to move forward in their personal and  work lives. Doctors here should encourage shelters to create an informal and  congenial set-up. Managements need to understand that there is a story behind  every unusual behaviour, and they must learn what this story is. A programme  conducted by a panel of psychotherapists and psychoanalysts can enable staff to  respond to post trauma stress disorder among inmates with empathy rather than  victim blaming.
				</p>
				<p>
					Assigning diagnostic  labels to victims of domestic violence can result in their stigmatisation and  ostracism. Family members and the community are known to have used mental  health professionals to declare women 'unfit' to live in the family, to be a  parent, to function as an autonomous individual or to take up a job. Families  are known to have used a woman's mentals health episodes to take away her  property rights, or the right to live in a matrimonial or parental home.  'Madness certificates' given by mental health professionals are used by  husbands to divorce or desert their wives, or throw them out of their  matrimonial homes.
				</p>

				<h4>Women and mental hospitals</h4>
				<p>
					Such women get confined  to mental asylums as per the directives of the Mental Health Act, 1987. Once  dumped in a mental asylum, it is impossible to get out even after complete  recovery. "Women in mental hospitals have fewer visitors, are abandoned or  tend to stay on longer than men within the institution. There are fewer  voluntary patients among women than among men. Even in adjudication for a  woman's institutionalisation, the official discourses are often coloured by the  sex role stereotypes that the judges, police officials and the staff in mental  hospitals uphold." <a class="reference" href="#eight" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Davar, B. Women-centred mental health: issues and concerns.Vikalpa: alternatives. Special issue on gender and transformation. Vikas Adhyayan Kendra, Mumbai, 2001; IX (1& 2): 117-130." id="8">(9)</a> A social worker remarks after a visit to a mental  hospital: "The interaction with female patients made me sadder. Almost all  of them were abandoned/ dumped by families or the police and court got them  admitted after they hit rock bottom. Most were forced to face violent  situations in their lives and had painful and atrocious accounts to tell. In  many cases, one could see (although without an in-depth study, one cannot claim  and prove) that the mental distress, ill health, had its roots not in a  person's biology or psychology, but in society, in our social  environment." <a class="reference" href="#nine" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Joshi L. At the fag end...a visit to Yervada mental hospital. Aaina-a mental health advocacy newsletter, 2002; 2 (1): 7- 8." id="9">(10)</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The wall of secrecy  about the administration of drugs, surgery and electro-convulsive therapy needs  to be condemned by citizens' initiatives and ethical medical practitioners. The  serious and long-lasting side effects of the biomedical approach need to be  highlighted. Our mental hospitals need to focus on psychotherapy and  counselling which involve therapies that produce positive results with few or  no negative side effects.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Developmental counselling</h4>
				<p>
					The only sure way out of  repeated attacks of mental illness is to make women's material reality more  secure, liberating and healthy. Developmental counselling aims at removal of  chronic conflict situations in women's lives that are associated with high  mental health morbidity. It is based on the understanding that the doctor's or  counsellor's commitment is a necessary condition for counselling success. <a class="reference" href="#ten" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Dinkmeyer D and E Caldwell. Developental counselling and guidance: a comprehensive school approach. Harvard University, USA, 1970, p 87." id="10">(11)</a> It increases self-direction and evolves better problem solving and  decision-making abilities. This is the axis around which human rights therapy  or counselling revolves. It emerged in the wake of the liberationist social  movements as an alternative to the bio-medical approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					The most successful  healer is one who avoids victim blaming and provides patient listening. <a class="reference" href="#eleven" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Nelson-Jones R. Practical counselling and helping skills. Better Yourself Books, Bombay, 1994, p.12." id="11">(12)</a> Those with communication disabilities need special help. <a class="reference" href="#twelve" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Amar J. Improving approaches to people with communication disabilities. Disability Dialogue, 2002 January-April. Issue III : 1-12." id="12">(13)</a> At the same time,  "Reversing the process of alienation by consciously building community  networks is a must. Mental health professionals should be seen in the community  rather than in the secure institute or clinics." <a class="reference" href="#thirteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Shetty H.

				<h4>Training programmes</h4>
				<p>
					There is an urgent need  to sensitise and train general practitioners and other health personnel on  mental health issues caused by domestic violence. Health posts and public  hospitals must have social counsellors who are in touch with voluntary  organisations providing institutional support to women in social distress.  Doctors should discuss domestic violence and mental health in the electronic  and print media, and remind the profession of its ethical duty to victims'  needs. <a class="reference" href="#fourteen" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Seden J. Counselling skills in social work practice. Open University Press, Buckingham and Philadelphia, USA, 1999, p 142. " id="14">(15)</a>
