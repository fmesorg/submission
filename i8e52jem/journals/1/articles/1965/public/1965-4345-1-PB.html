				<h4>Issues in Medical Ethics (1)</h4>
				<p>
					Thanks for sending me the January-March 97 issue of your very significant journal and the subscription slip - this kind of systematisation is good, especially because subscribers tend to forget renewing their subscription unless reminded for. I am enclosing a cheque
				</p>
				<p>
					As a lay person (I'm not a medical doctor) and a concerned citizen, I find your journal of immense value as it so firmly contributes to humanity's health in a holistic sense. For your great work (and it's rare now-a-days) I congratulate you and the editorial board members.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without any doubt, Issues in Medical Ethics is the only journal on medical ethics in India. I'm sure in days to come your family of subscribers (medical and non-medical) will be large enough to provide you further sense of its unique worth.
