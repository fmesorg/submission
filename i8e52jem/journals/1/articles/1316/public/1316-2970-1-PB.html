				<h4>Brain death</h4>
				<p>
					This  refers to the article 'Brain death and our transplantlaw' by Sunil K  Pandya <a class="reference" href="#one" data-placement="top" data-trigger="hover" rel="tooltip" title="Pandya SK: 'Brain death' and our transplant law. Issues in Medical Ethics 2001; 9: 51-52." id="1">(1)</a> in which Dr Pandya concludes by saying we need a separate law which  defines brain death clearly, and this definition must supersede the older  definition of cardiopulmonary death.
				</p>
				<p>
					The problem with  brain death is that the patient is still hooked to a life support system and  the heart continues to beat. Doctors are unwilling to describe such patients as  dead and use the word 'dead' synonymously with brain stem death. Vague terms  such as 'deeply unconscious' are preferred. In my experience brain death is not  clear even in the minds of doctors. Such patients lie for weeks and months in  the ICU and even doctors are not willing to certify them as dead. Hope springs  eternal in the human heart and relatives who have heard stories, seen movies,  are gullible and believe that one day the patient will open his eyes and start  talking to them. People believe a miracle will happen. No doctor is willing to  counter this thinking.
				</p>
				<p>
					The law on transplant  is not so bad and many people are also willing to donate organs but the medical  profession must be re-educated and urged to declare a brain dead person as  dead. Further, they should tell the patient that the life support machine will  only be kept on if they want to donate organs. Let us hope that this happens  soon.
