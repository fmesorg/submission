					I would like to share comments made during a lively  debate at the first international medical sociology conference in Chennai on  May 25-26, 2002.
				</p>
				<p>
					The debate revolved around issues of informed consent  and the ethics of live unrelated donation. What should the transplant surgeon  do when recipient and donor are unrelated but produce papers to legally  establish their biological relationship? What if donor and recipient admit they  are unrelated but the donor claims that he is willing to donate a kidney on  altruistic grounds? Transplant surgeons participating in the debate said that  very often the donor is an employee of the recipient, who has voluntarily  consented to be part of the operation, fully knowing the possible risks  involved. Surgeons confessed that they were helpless when they were sure that  their patient is biologically unrelated to the donor, but the patients  possessed the required legal documents in support of their claim; one knows how  easy it is to get forged affidavits from the concerned authorities in India.
				</p>
				<p>
					The broader predicament for surgeons is: should  they be judgmental in such situations when there are no legal impediments to  the transplant? When unsure, surgeons are required to refer the issue to the  ethical clearance committee concerned with the kidney transplantation. Mr N  Ram, editor of <em>Frontline,</em> mentioned that in Karnataka the committee had  received more than 1,000 cases for clearance &mdash; and only 22 cases were  rejected, because the papers were not in order. Some of them subsequently  brought 'appropriate' papers and got clearance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Two transplant surgeons felt that they need not be  judgemental when donor and recipients are medically eligible and fit for the  transplantation, their legal documents are in order (genuine or otherwise), and  the donor has given voluntary informed consent. They also said the HLA typing  test carried out to verify the relationship claim is not 100 per cent reliable.  In this context, surgeons have no option but to undertake the operation.  Moreover, they say it is especially warranted, since the demand for kidneys far  exceeds the availability from cadaver (brain stem death) organs.
				</p>
				<p>
					This view was strongly contested by those who felt  surgeons could always take a moral stand and refuse to be part of a operation  when they suspected the donor of participating for an incentive.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the question of gender bias in organ transplants  (there are more live unrelated female donors than male donors), a participant  questioned the ethics of denying a woman's freedom to make an independent and  informed decision, when she is desperately in need of money and wishes to  donate her kidney to repay a debt. Failing this option, she may see  prostitution as an option.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transplant surgeons also questioned the integrity  of kidney transplants among related donors. They cited examples of sons  donating a kidney to the father in exchange for educational sponsorship or  other financial incentives. Should such transplants be allowed just because  they are biologically related, even though it is clear that compensation is  involved? How does one verify the integrity of the relationship in related  kidney donation?
				</p>
				<p>
					Others feared that if unrelated donation were not  regulated, people would prefer (buying) kidneys from unrelated donors &mdash; cheap  for Rs 40,000-60,000 and without risk to their relatives.
