				<h4>Pharmas, physicians and ethics</h4>
				<p>
					The relationship between doctors and the drug  industry is complex; both exist to serve people and to improve health. Yet,  their interests can often conflict. The authors elaborate on some of the  problems and make recommendations for reducing the conflict. From their well  referenced article, we learn that the cost of development of a new drug is  between US$300 and $600 million, most of which is provided by industry. In the  United States, about US$6 billion was spent on clinical research in 2000, of  which 70% came directly from industry. Promotion and marketing consumes a  quarter to a third of a company's entire budget, and over $8,000 per physician.
				</p>
				<p>
					They stress that transparency between doctors and drug companies is essential  and recommend that dualities of interest should be publicly declared,  acceptance of gifts should be kept to a minimum while non-service-oriented  gifts should not be accepted. Further, support for travel should be restricted  to those making formal contributions to meetings while research should be guided  by scientific and ethical rather than commercial values.

				<h4>Why is the Hippocratic oath  taken?</h4>
				<p>
					The renowned ethicist at Georgetown University  Medical Center, Ed Pellegrino, points out that although the Hippocratic oath  has come under fire in recent times from a variety of groups including  ethicists, historians, feminists, and patients' rights activists and has been  called outdated, it continues to be in use at commencement exercises in  virtually all American and Canadian medical schools, though modified to satisfy  today's mores.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pellegrino argues that oath taking persists because it unites the medical  profession as a <em>de facto</em> moral community and sets it apart as one committed to  beyond self interest. It reminds one of the antiquity of the profession and has  the seed of hope in it. Forgetting the oath would risk converting medicine into  a commercial or industrial enterprise.

				<h4>Illusions about informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					The authors describe a study of informed consent in  Bangladesh, among 105 pregnant women participating in a community-based study  of iron supplementation.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Although most women were informed about the objectives of the study,  many...did not understand that they were free to decline to participate. Even  fewer women understood that they might choose to leave the study. About half  believed that participation was part of ordinary, routine health care.  Eighty-seven percent indicated that they participated because they believed  that doing so might carry such great advantages, primarily in terms of medical  treatment for themselves or improved health for their babies, that it was  difficult to say no."

				<h4>When using a cheaper vaccine is  unethical </h4>
				<p>
					Should one use the unsafe but cheaper Semple  vaccine for rabies when a safer non human cell culture vaccine exists? The  writers argue that smaller intra-dermal doses of the latter vaccine are as  effective and medically accepted, require fewer visits to the doctor, and bring  costs down to the same as for the Semple vaccine. This makes it unethical to  continue Semple vaccine which results in 600 Indians developing Allergic  Encephala Myelitis annually.

				<h4>Pre-implantational genetic  diagnosis</h4>
				<p>
					Despite our flourishing industry in assisted  reproductive technologies, there has been little debate, in India, on ethical  questions raised by the technique of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).  This has been the subject of heated debate in Japan, where people with genetic  disorders face stigma and discrimination. This article describes the  development of guidelines before reporting the results of two surveys, of  geneticists and of lay people participating in support groups for parents of  children with genetic abnormalities. Questions were asked on attitudes towards  PGD, amniocentesis, and women's right to abortion. The results show  interesting differences in the opinions of lay people and experts, and  between men and women. The discussion and conclusion refer to attitudinal  changes evident in more recent studies, and call for more open public debate on  the subject. The guidelines are given as an appendix.

				<h4>Exporting medical ethics  education </h4>
				<p>
					It is most amusing to read a letter from a fourth-year  medical student suggesting that the St Johns Medical College experiment of  teaching medical ethics to their students (<em>Natl Med J India</em> 1997;10:  288-9) be used as a model for teaching medical ethics in British medical  schools. At a time when Indian medical schools themselves have yet to  introduce ethics in the course, it appears that, once again, the grass is  greener on the other side.
