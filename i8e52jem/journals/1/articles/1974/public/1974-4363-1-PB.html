				<h4>A look at the modern  doctor who doctors ethics</h4>
				<p>
					"Thou shall not  steal," The good Lord said,
					<br />
					But look, I need rich meals.
					<br />
					Besides, I have a better head,
					<br />
					His patients I should steal.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Like brothers you must treat your mates,"
					<br />
					The good God stoutly said.
					<br />
					Come to my clinic, read my rates,
					<br />
					I charge my patients that much less,
					<br />
					To lure them from my mates.
				</p>
				<p>
					"You simply cannot advertise,"
					<br />
					The law so very clearly states.
					<br />
					My trumpet I shall so disguise,
					<br />
					With cunning words I'll self-inflate,
					<br />
					What fault will you then find?
				</p>
				<p>
					"As doctors you'll not give kickbacks,"
					<br />
					Our Code has disallowed.
					<br />
					Be practical, look here old chap,
					<br />
					I'm young, I must erase this vow.
					<br />
					To live I must kick-back.
				</p>
				<p>
					"You swore the Hippocratic Oath!"
					<br />
					The Lord in grief did weep.
					<br />
					"In dishonour you are deeply steeped.
					<br />
					You stole from mates for tarnished gold.
					<br />
					Do you know you've lost your soul?"
