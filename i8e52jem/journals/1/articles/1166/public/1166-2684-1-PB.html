					The major  ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) issues that have arisen in the context  of developments in genomics and health in developed countries are also of  relevance to developing countries. The question before the World Health  Organization (WHO) today is: what role can it play vis-&agrave;-vis these issues? It  must identify its priorities and the responsibilities that it should undertake.
				</p>
				<p>
					Current  major activities, applications, and work in genetics and genomics are  extensive. The scope of the debate covers areas like genetic testing and  screening for diagnosis, treatment and prevention; genetic reproductive  screening that may allow for selection whether on the basis of disease,  disability, disorder, or sex, or perhaps in the future, even trait selection;  genetic manipulation (both somatic and germ line), for treatment, prevention,  or enhancement; and finally, genetic databases and research which results in  the production of knowledge and the development of techniques which could be  used for reproductive selection, treatment of disease, diagnosis, prevention,  or enhancement.
				</p>

				<h4>Justice and resource allocation</h4>
				<p>
					By far  the most frequently raised issue pertains to justice and resource allocation.  Foremost among the many aspects here is the relative position of genetics and  genomics vs other health care needs: What is the relevance of genomic advances  to countries that cannot even afford to provide existing vaccines and essential  drugs? In many developing countries, even basic health infrastructure is  lacking, and much more could be done to improve health status by providing  clean water and sanitation and improving nutrition, rather than providing  access to genetics services, or channeling resources toward genomic  research. Posed in another way, the question becomes: Why have such vast  global resources, both private and public, been channeled to genomic research,  when the majority have no access to basic amenities and health care?
				</p>
				<p>
					The  answer to that question lies in the balance of political and economic power,  and in the historical development and under-development of economies and  societies. Still, it is a useful question to keep in mind when we think about  the issue of justice and resource allocation. The overriding fear is that  advances in genomic science will increase inequities: the gap between developed  and developing countries, and between the haves and the have-nots.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much has  been said of the 10:90 ratio: where only 10% of global health research is on  the health problems of 90% of the population. The challenge here to link  genomics research to the burden of disease in the developing world, and focus  it on the major infectious diseases still causing high mortalities in  developing countries - for example, on pathogen genomics of such disease  vectors and agents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Imbalances  in equity and access to genetic services exist across countries and between  developed and developing countries. Within countries, inequities also  exist among different social classes. Also, access to genetic services -  or the lack of it &mdash; in a society will affect women differently from men. How  can we prevent these gaps from widening? Can something be done so that  the results of genetics and genomic advances in health benefit those most in  need of them?
				</p>
				<p>
					Since  equity and access depend primarily on social structure and economic  development, a long-term solution will have to deal with changing social  structures and economic power relations. Nevertheless, a minimum objective  should be to monitor equity and impact. This will give us an indication  of whether or not the new genetics will lead to increasing inequities and  access. It has also been repeatedly emphasised that there is a need to  encourage the participation of developing countries in genomic research. When  countries are unable to afford the infrastructure and investment, it has been  suggested that WHO help to build capacity on a regional basis. This will help  increase access, and regional networks could also be built. It is also  suggested that WHO could play an advocacy role in advancing genomic research  for diseases that constitute major health problems in poor countries.  This is a role that WHO is already playing in other areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally,  there is a need to improve the distribution and access to basic genetic  services in developing countries. In many cases, this would also help to  improve women's reproductive health choices. The impact on gender equity,  however, should be monitored, as there could also be situations in which  women's position will be affected negatively.
				</p>

				<h4>Ownership issues</h4>
				<p>
					Closely  related to the issue of social justice and resource allocation are the  ownership issues. These arise when institutions or companies patent  genetic material from research or genetic databases. This controversy has been  erupting in the context of a fierce battle over the accessibility of HIV-AIDS  drugs in developing countries who are unable to afford the high prices of  needed patented drugs. These issues have taken on several facets, of which  three are crucial.
				</p>
				<p>
					First,  should living material be patentable? Living material may be ESTs, SNPs, gene  sequences, partial gene sequences, cell lines, tissues, organs, microorganisms,  plants, or animals. If one agrees to patentability, there is a debate on which  kind of patent is appropriate, and whether broad patents covering everything  should be allowed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those who  object to patenting argue that gene sequences and such are discoveries of  nature, and not inventions. The basis for objecting to patents on DNA  fragments and ESTs is that these are relatively easy to find, and that they  constitute tools, rather than an inventive step. HUGO, for example, has  opposed patents on ESTs and SNPs on this basis. Some scientists oppose patents  as a barrier to the free access to knowledge, impeding research. On the  other hand, those who argue for patenting say that insofar as patents protect  the rights of patent holders, they encourage the sharing of knowledge.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  global spectrum, at one extreme are countries whose patent offices grant  patents from ESTs to transgenic organisms. Although human beings have  been deemed non-patentable, organs, genes, and other parts of the human body  may be patentable. The US Patent and Trademark Office is of course the  prime example. At the other extreme are the countries where all parts of  the human body, including DNA sequences, genes and cell lines, are deemed  non-patentable. Countries that tend toward this end include France,  Austria and the Czech Republic. Many other countries have an intermediate  position, generally allowing for the patenting of DNA sequences, genes, and  cell lines, but not of organs and organisms.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  Organization for African Unity (OAU) has proposed a model law based on the  Convention for Biodiversity, which it hopes the World Trade Organization (WTO)  will eventually adopt. It has also asked that the Trade Related Aspects  of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement incorporate a general ban on  the patenting of living organisms and the natural processes that produce these  living organisms.
				</p>
				<p>
					The  second way in which the ownership issue has been framed is the challenge posed  by indigenous people's organisations, who argue that living materials such as  plants that are sourced by drug companies for useful substances have actually  been identified and sometimes even cultured by indigenous peoples for  years. They are therefore the repositories of indigenous people's  knowledge and intellectual property.
				</p>
				<p>
					This has  been recognised in the formation of a <em>Committee on Intellectual Property and  Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge, and Folklore</em> to study access to  genetic resources and benefit sharing. This concept also forms the basis for  the Common System on Access to Genetic Resources, adopted by Bolivia, Columbia,  Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. Under this system, contracts have to take  into account the rights and interests of the suppliers of genetic resources,  their derivatives and related intangible components. They must also  guarantee the equitable sharing of benefits deriving from the access to genetic  resources. Furthermore, in Peru, there is a system of optional  registration of the collective knowledge of indigenous people with respect to  biological resources, access to which would be subject to authorisation granted  by the indigenous people themselves. Both the 'patent on life' and the  'indigenous people's resources' issues challenge the existing patent system.  The ownership issue has also been framed in the 'flexibility' and  'benefit-sharing' approaches, which do not challenge the existing patent system  but work within it.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focus  of the 'flexibility' approach is the debate on how patents should be  enforced. At the core of this debate is the TRIPS Agreement, 1994, which  has clauses allowing for 'parallel imports' (imports of drugs from countries in  which they are the cheapest), compulsory licences, and exemptions in certain  situations, such as in public health emergencies. The Brazilian victory in the  HIV-AIDS drug case is an example of this. In this context, the European  Union is now pressing the WTO to be flexible and to take public health into  consideration in TRIPS.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other  approach is benefits sharing, which pertains to the ethical conduct of research  as well as the setting up of databases. In order to avoid exploitation of  indigenous populations and other vulnerable groups, guidelines may specify, for  example, that benefit sharing agreements be drawn up before the research or  data base is set up.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  WHO's role regarding this issue? Is it an intermediary or advocacy role?  It already has experience negotiating drug prices, and in benefit  sharing. Should it expand its role beyond that?
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  WHO's stand on the 'patents on life' issue? Should it take a stand?  If it is to promote the interests of developing countries, should it support  the OAU's model law?
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  WHO's stand vis-&agrave;-vis the indigenous people's resources issue? Should it  promote the common system of the five Latin American countries? How should it  play a part in WIPO and WTO discussions? Should it have a statement on  the review of the TRIPS Agreement, for example?
				</p>

				<h4>Stigmatisation and discrimination</h4>
				<p>
					Stigmatisation  could affect entire communities found to carry a particular genetic disorder,  or to individuals. It is more likely to have a greater impact in  societies with lower levels of science education, and in particular social  contexts; for example, women could be more vulnerable in societies practising arranged  marriages.
				</p>
				<p>
					The issue  of genetic discrimination has arisen in two contexts: in employment, and in  insurance. Currently genetic testing is rarely done at the workplace, but  this may change with the advances in genome mapping as the range of disease and  disorders to be identified from genetic testing increases.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discrimination  in employment has happened in the past. In the United States for example,  Blacks who tested positive for sickle cell anaemia were denied employment even  if they were healthy and may never develop the disease. Workers in  countries with weak labour laws, and weak or non-existent labour unions will be  particularly vulnerable
				</p>
				<p>
					Discrimination  in health insurance will have a wide impact wherever health care financing is  predominantly risk-rated insurance. This has already occurred in the  US, and in response, some states have set up legislation prohibiting or  restricting the use of genetic tests in insurance. But even in the United  Kingdom with the National Health Service, people have been discriminated  against for life insurance on the basis of genetic testing. (It was  recently reported that the UK government endorsed a ban on genetic testing by  insurance companies.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The  issues of stigmatisation and discrimination raise the corresponding issues of  privacy and confidentiality. Who will determine the principles, bases and  limits of privacy and confidentiality when handling an individual's genetic  information? If the principles have been laid, who will ensure that the  principles are adhered to in practice? And how will this be done?
				</p>
				<p>
					There is  a need for international guidelines to address issues related to genetic  testing in employment and insurance. There is already a lot of discussion (for  example, by the European Group on Ethics, Nuffield Council) on this. WHO has  also issued the Proposed International Guidelines on Ethical Issues in Medical  Genetics and Genetic Services (1998). Nonetheless, it need not stop  at developing international guidelines. It could also play an advocacy  role vis-&agrave;-vis governments, and help build the institutional capacity to  address problems of discrimination that arise.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Informed consent</h4>
				<p>
					The issue  of informed consent follows closely from our discussion of genetic  discrimination and stigmatisation. The importance of free and informed consent  cannot be overstated whether it is in relation to genetic testing, research or  databases. The difficulty here lies in obtaining genuinely free and informed  consent in societies where there is no such tradition, or among communities  unfamiliar with western scientific practices. The requirements and process of  informed consent are different for testing in clinical settings and for  research. In testing for disorders, genetic counseling could be very important,  especially when preventive interventions or abortions are not accessible.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  research, special consideration will have to be given to obtaining consent,  avoiding manipulation or coercion of vulnerable persons (for example of women  in communities where men make decisions), ensuring that the population  adequately understands the research, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					In  addition to the consent from individual participants, the need for community  agreement - and the method of achieving this - may have to be ascertained.  People should also be informed about the potential future uses of their genetic  material.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the  collection of databases, the appropriate process for informed consent needs to  be identified. For example, will it be an opt-in or an opt-out consent  procedure? Further, when studying databases or genetic material in existing repositories,  can genetic material be used for purposes other than that for which informed  consent was given in the first place?
				</p>
				<p>
					What is  WHO's role? Definitely, international guidelines are required for the  introduction of testing or screening programmes, for the informed consent  process in testing and screening, for research, and for databases. The 1998  Proposed International Guidelines are an initiative in this direction.  Other organisations have also developed guidelines. Does WHO need to develop  its own guidelines? Or should it review existing guidelines with a view  to endorsing them?
				</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h4>Sex selection</h4>
				<p>
					Although  sex selection is in a way a discrimination issue, it is discussed separately  here to give it particular prominence. Sex selection is a reality in some  developing countries where female infanticide and foeticide are carried  out. There is a real danger that prenatal genetic screening will lead to  an increase in this practice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Developing  countries are more often than not strongly patriarchal. Sex selection  occurs in an entrenched culture of son preference and women's subordination  where having daughters is considered to be an economical disadvantage. Still,  state policies can worsen the situation in the context of an existing cultural  bias. In China for example, the one-child policy has resulted in a  distortion of the sex ratio in certain geographical areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Discrimination,  stigmatisation and sex selection in society occur in the context of entrenched  values, interests, and cultural beliefs and practices. Their eradication  requires investment in long-term strategies of economic and social development  and educational and cultural upliftment. What should WHO do to convince  national governments to invest seriously in these long-term strategies?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Eugenics</h4>
				<p>
					Eugenics,  the science of improving the human population through controlled breeding,  encompasses the elimination of disease, disorder, or undesirable traits, on the  one hand, and genetic enhancement on the other. It is pursued by nations  through state policies and programmes. The Nazi state in Germany in the  mid-20th century, for example, used mass extermination. Other state means are  forced sterilisation, selective immigration policies, and population control  policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eugenics  is a current danger in dictatorial and authoritarian states. It was not  too long ago that one particularly technocratic and authoritarian state  instituted incentives and disincentives for eugenic purposes. With advances in  genomics, eugenics becomes possible through techniques of somatic genetic  manipulation, and possibly in the future, even germ-line manipulation. It has  been argued that though state eugenic policies, which inevitably involve  coercion, are objectionable, eugenic decisions by individual parents constitute  a free and informed choice and therefore should not meet with censure. This  view is debatable given that most societies, in particular developing  countries, do not have structures supporting disabled persons. Moreover,  women's reproductive decision-making processes are constrained and influenced  by the social and economic environment, as well as by current norms in medical  practice, practices such as directive counseling, and also by social pressure.  Indeed, while preventing serious disabilities, it is important to ensure that  we respect diversity and reaffirm the tolerance of difference. What is WHO's  role in this? Could there be international guidelines or even international  conventions, addressing eugenic state policies and practices? Guidelines  already exist for somatic and germ-line manipulation. Does WHO need to  look into the relevance of these for developing countries? Could there be  guidelines for individual reproductive decision-making that would safeguard  men's and women's reproductive rights while also guard against eugenic  practices?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Ideology and genetics</h4>
				<p>
					The  general ideological context is important to understand how genetics can be  misunderstood and give rise to incorrect suppositions of the genetic  basis of racial differences, notions of superior and inferior genes, and of how  genes determine traits and behaviour. The existence of social classes and  hierarchical relationships, the dominance of reductionist science, an emphasis  on rote learning rather than critical thinking in educational systems, are  examples of social structure and processes in society that do not enable an  individual to easily understand the complexities of the interactions of genes,  environment, and culture.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is  important to raise the level and quality of scientific education in general.  Specifically, it is important to provide adequate and accurate genetic  information, knowledge and education. Such efforts would aid in countering  genetic deterministic ways of understanding the role of genes, and of genetic  tests and interventions. It would also counter 'gene hype', or unrealistic expectations  of the potential applications resulting from the genomic revolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO may  have a role to play in identifying the educational needs of international  agencies, national governments including policy makers, and health care  professionals. At the national level, it could possibly also advocate on this  need, and provide the tools for identifying the educational needs at the level  of the public, community and schools. There is also a role in capacity building  for genetics education, and in developing and disseminating appropriate genetic  educational materials. Nevertheless, other international bodies, such as  UNESCO, might have genetic education initiatives; efforts should be coordinated  rather than to duplicated. WHO might concentrate, for example, on the  educational needs concerning the delivery of genetic and medical services, or  in medical and health education.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>The risks and hazards of genomics</h4>
				<p>
					In human  genomics, there are risks to the individual inherent in genetic therapy and  manipulation. Germ-line intervention constitutes a special srisk of  irreversible changes to human beings. Is a moratorium on germ-line  intervention sufficient, or should there be a permanent prohibition? How  could a moratorium or prohibition be monitored? There is also a danger of  errant states using human genomics to develop biological weapons for warfare.
				</p>
				<p>
					Non-human  genomics faces threats from genetically modified organisms and transgenic  organisms, to the safety of the environment and the ecosystem. There are also  trends toward antibody resistance in pathogens, a reduction in diversity, and  an increasing reliance on and dominance of transnational corporations.
				</p>
				<p>
					WHO can  play a role in quality assurance in genetic services, by providing benchmark or  'best practice' models. Is there a role for WHO as well, to monitor risks and  hazards and to disseminate the information? Is there a need for international  guidelines and declarations on risks and hazards, providing for moratoriums or  prohibitions, for example, and is there a role for WHO in this?
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					The  purpose of this paper is to raise questions to stimulate discussion and debate.  It would be most helpful to focus on what WHO's role should be. As a global  health organisation, how can it most effectively play a leadership role in  debates on the impact of genomic science on human ethics and society? What  direction should it forge that is consistent with its mandate of 'health for  all'? Does it need to play the role of convenor, coordinator, and mediator? WHO  will have to set its priorities and develop the concrete ways in which it can  intervene in the global processes to improve health in developing countries and  in the interest of equity in health.
