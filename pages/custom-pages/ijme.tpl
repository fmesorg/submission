				<h2>About the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics</h2>
				<p>
					The Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, published since 1993 by the <b>Forum for Medical Ethics Society,</b> is a multi-disciplinary academic journal providing a platform for publication of original material and discussion on all aspects of healthcare ethics and the humanities, relevant to and/or from the perspective of India and other developing countries.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Multi-disciplinary inquiry:</b> The journal promotes multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural inquiry by academics as well as activists from the fields of bio-medicine, social sciences, law and humanities. It strives to involve all cadres of, and beneficiaries from, the health care system, and strengthen the hands of those with ethical values and concern for the under-privileged.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Peer-reviewed and Indexed material:</b> All material submitted for publication in the journal, go through a rigorous system of internal and external peer review by experts, and revisions when needed,  before receiving approval for publication. In 2005, the US National Libraries of Medicine (PubMed) decided to index all previous issues (starting from the first issue in 1993) and also start prospective indexing of IJME. In addition to PubMed, IJME is also indexed in a few other international databases, such as SCOPUS.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Free publication and open access:</b> As a policy, since its inception, the IJME has never charged authors for publication of their writings, and all material available on the website of the journal is free and offers open access to all. However, the print copy of the journal is charged for. Those interested in receiving a print copy of the journal may do so on payment of a subscription. The journal does not have institutional support and funding, and is run by a group of volunteers and part-time paid staff. The journal is primarily sustained by donations and grants received from individuals and philanthropic organisations. We therefore encourage readers to make financial contributions to the journal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Periodicity:</b> The IJME is published four times in a year – January, April, July and October. Some material lined up for publication in a future print issue is published in advance on the journal’s website under the section title, “Online First”. In addition, we are gradually expanding publication of material only on the website.
				</p>
				<p>
					The journal is owned and published by the <b>Forum for Medical Ethics Society (FMES).</b>
				</p>

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					In 1992, eight doctors known for their eminence in ethical practice and concern for the public health system established a panel on the platform of Forum for Medical Ethics (FME) and contested the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) elections. By sending out a letter to all doctors in Maharashtra and by using the media for creating public awareness on the role and responsibilities of the Medical Councils, the FME strove to bring the implementation of medical ethics to the centre of the debate in the election. The FME ensured that votes for the members of its panel were voluntarily sent through mail by each voter on his/her own in the postal ballot system used for the elections at that time. The group also witnessed massive rigging of the elections by the candidate-doctors supported by money power and politics. The electoral malpractices were documented in detail by the group, and presented to the Mumbai High Court in a PIL and also communicated widely through the first newsletter, entitled “Medical Ethics”, published in August 1993.
				</p>
				<p>
					Medical Ethics found wider support from the profession and the public, and was brought out every three months and gradually expanded its scope. When it applied for registration as a journal with the Registrar of Newspapers, New Delhi, it was provided a new title, and so from January 1996, it was brought out as Issues in Medical Ethics. Later, when the Registrar of Newspapers accepted our application for the change in name, the journal started coming out as Indian Journal of Medical Ethics from January 2004.
